Historically, there have been two areas of the dolerite called Aberdare Dolerite in the vicinity of Kalgoorlie. Recent studies have indicated that the unit at the southern end of the Golden Mile is a less differentiated part of the Gold Mile Dolerite. The dolerite at the northern end of the Boomerang Anticline cannot be demonstrated to be part of the Golden Mile Dolerite and so the original name is retained.","The Aberdare Dolerite lies at the northern end of the Boomerang Anticline and is is contiguous with the Golden Mile Dolerite across the Adelaide Fault. Clout et al. (1990) distinguished the Aberdare Dolerite as separate unit from the Golden Mile Dolerite as described by Travis et al (1971). Bateman et al. (2001) used geochemical analyses of the Aberdare Dolerite of Clout et al. (1990) on the southern side of the Adelaide Fault to infer that the dolerite is part of the Golden Mile Dolerite. However, the lack of geochemical data on the dolerite around the northern closure of the anticline precludes the re-assigning of the Aberdare Dolerite to the Golden Mile Dolerite in this area.",The Aberdare Dolerite is named after a former gold mining lease at the southern end of the Golden Mile.,,"The Aberdare Dolerite around the northern closure of the Boomerang Anticline is poorly documented.

2945,27099,CZ-EUa-klg,5034,Abrakurrie Limestone,1,"Yellowish porous bryozoan calcarenite and granule calcirudite; mostly grainstone, some packstone","The Abrakurrie Limestone is a moderate to high energy, cool water, shelfal carbonate characterized by bryozoan limestone. Three informal members are distinguished based on fauna and lithology, with all three showing marked cyclicity. This cyclicity has been attributed to variations in the depth of wave abrasion rather than pronounced shallowing or deepening, as cycles are bounded by submarine hardgrounds. It was deposited in water depths of about 100 m in the central southern Eucla Basin, and is up to approximately 120 m thick. The formation is late Oligocene to early Miocene in age, deposited between 28 and 21 Ma during a second-order transgressive eustatic cycle. In the onshore Eucla Basin, the Abrakurrie Limestone rests disconformably on the middle Eocene Wilson Bluff Limestone, and is disconformably overlain by the middle Miocene Nullarbor Limestone in the onshore Eucla Basin. Further south in deeper water depositional settings, it is probable that the upper contact will be a correlative conformity rather than a disconformity. For this reason, it is grouped with the Nullarbor Limestone in the Eucla Group.","The Abrakurrie Limestone extends throughout the southern central Eucla Basin, with a maximum thickness centred around Madura (Lowry, 1970, fig. 25). Based on sections in caves and coastal cliffs, Lowry showed the westernmost extent as being near Toolina Cove, although other authors have indicated approximately 30 m thickness of Abrakurrie Limestone at this locality (James and Bone, 1994), suggesting an unknown extent further west. The unit does not rech the inner platform edge of the Eucla Basin, extending as far north as the Trans-Australian Railway Line at Loongana, but only extending about 30 km north of the coast at the South Australian border. The formation extends under the Roe Plains onto the continental shelf, where it likely grades into part of the Dugong Supersequence (Feary and James, 1998, Totterdell et al., 2000).","The Abrakurrie Limestone was named after Abrakurrie Cave by Lowry (1968) and described in detail by Lowry (1970). The type section is on the west wall of this same cave, which is approximately halfway between Mundrabilla and Eucla Roadhouses, and is 108 ft (~33 m) thick as measured by Lowry (1970). This thickness has been later confirmed by Li et al. (1996) and James and Bone (1994). The Abrakurrie Limestone overlies the Wilson Bluff Limestone throughout its range, and is overlain by Nullarbor Limestone or, where present, the Mullamullang Member of the Nullarbor Limestone.  Li et al. (1996) established that the Toolinna Limestone at Toolina Cove (which is underlain by undisputed Wilson Bluff Limestone and overlain by Nullarbor Limestone) is identical to the Abrakurrie Limestone lithologically and contains abundant foraminifers resembling those from the Abrakurrie Limestone. It is quite different to the Toolinna Limestone at Point Culver, which resembles the Wilson Bluff Limestone lithologically and faunally. They considered that high-energy facies of the Toolinna Limestone might better be considered Abrakurrie Limestone, but noted that Philip (in Lowry, 1970) had recorded Eocene echinoids at Toolina Cove; Philip (in Lowry 1970) also considered the fauna as a whole to be different from Oligocene-Miocene faunas recorded elsewhere along Australia's southern margin. It remains unresolved whether the 'Toolinna Limestone' at Toolina Cove is actually Abrakurrie Limestone or an Eocene higher energy marginal facies, as Lowry (1970) originally suggested. ",,"The Abrakurrie Limestone is only exposed in the walls of caves beneath the Nullarbor Plain, and more rarely in coastal cliffs. It consists of pale-coloured, commonly yellowish, bryozoal calcarenite and calcirudite and ranges from friable to very hard, but is generally poorly cemented. All lithologies within the unit are bioclastic, with minor clastic grains only observed at the northernmost extents of the unit. The macrofossils represent a brymol assemblage, dominated by bryozoans, bivalves, echinoids, and benthic foraminifers, with minor gastropods, brachiopods, planktic foraminifers, coralline algae and solitary corals (Lowry, 1970; James and Bone, 1991, 1992, 1994; Li et al., 1996). Bioturbation varies, but can be intensely developed in certain layers.  Initially divided into lower and upper informal units (James and Bone, 1991, 1992), later workers distinguished a lower member of thinly bedded and cross-bedded rudstone, a middle member of thinly bedded and burrowed grainstone, and an upper member of thick-bedded and heavily burrowed rudstone and floatstone, all of which display metre-scale cyclicity of subtidal origin (James and Bone, 1994; Li et al., 1996). Submarine hardgrounds separate the cycles, with bed thicknesses between hardground surfaces generally increasing up section (James and Bone, 1992, 1994).","The Abrakurrie Limestone was deposited in moderate to high energy, cool water, open-shelf, subtidal conditions in the western Eucla Basin. James and Bone (1994) and Li et al. (1996) estimated that the presently onshore portion of the Abrakurrie Limestone was deposited about 200 km inboard of the paleoshelf edge, and 50 to 80 km seaward of the paleoshoreline, at water depths of about 100 m. The limestone shows distinct metre-scale cyclicity, with hardgrounds separating cycles (James and Bone, 1994) indicating depositonal hiatuses, rather than emergence. James and Bone (1991, 1994) interpreted the cycles in terms of regular variation in the depth of wave abrasion, controlled by eustacy and climate. Li et al. (1996) recognized lower, middle and upper informal members divided according to lithology and fauna, and attributed these to deposition under cooler mesotrophic conditions for the lower two members compared to a well-lit, warmer water, oligotrophic environment for the upper member.",14,120,,"The Abrakurrie Limestone disconformably overlies the Wilson Bluff Limestone (and possibly the Toolinna Limestone, although see 'Derivation of Name', above). The unit is interpreted to onlap the basal Wilson Bluff unconformity to the north.  The Abrakurrie Limestone is disconformably overlain by the Nullarbor Limestone (and specifically the Mullamullang Member where present) in the onshore Eucla Basin. The contact is clearly erosional at several localities, with truncation of the Abrakurrie Limestone beds observed (Lowry, 1970). Offshore to the south, the unit grades into a correlative conformity (within the Dugong Supersequence; Feary and James, 1998; Totterdell et al., 2000) as water depth increases. The Abrakurrie and Nullarbor Limestones are here viewed as part of a single major depositional cycle, similar to the Cape Range Group of the Northern Carnarvon Basin or successions further east on the southern margin in the Murray and Otway Basins (Mannum Formation and Heytesbury Group respectively; Li et al., 1996).",,17,,,,4,,,,28,,21,,"Fossils from the Abrakurrie Limestone are dominated by benthic forms of little value for biostratigraphy, although macrofossil evidence suggests a general association with the Janjukian and Longfordian Australian regional stage (e.g. Ludbrook in Lowry, 1970; Philip, 1970; Cockbain, 1970; Kruse and Phillip, 1985; Darragh, 1985; Beu and Darragh, 2001).   Li et al. (1996) attempted to provide age constraints for the unit using somewhat limited foraminiferal data. Although precise ages could not be determined for the top and base, the unit was considered to extend across planktonic foraminiferal zones P21b to low N5. Based on the recovery of sparse  Amphistegina  spp. only 5 m above the base of the Abrakurrie Limestone (in Murra-el-Elevyn Cave), a maximum age of earliest Late Oligocene was interpreted; a peak abundance of this same taxon in the lower part of the upper member was linked to a regional acme event usually placed close to the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. For the minimum age, Li et al. (1996) recovered typical early Early Miocene fossils only a metre below the upper boundary with the Nullarbor Limestone;  Operculina , and other taxa which would indicate later Early Miocene (Longfordian) ages, were lacking from all studied sections (Li et al., 1996, p. 443). Other foraminiferal evidence generally supports this interpretation without providing extra precision.",No,,,2,,No,DE in Progress,No,No,CZ,EUa,,,,,MIGIPSM,2.02E+13,,No,No

It is conformably underlain by the Never Can Tell Basalt and is structurally overlain by mafic and sedimentary units.","The Agnew Komatiite is a marker unit that delineates the shape of major folds in aeromagnetic images.

It consists of a basal oxidised siltstone unit with lesser sandstone and dolomite, the Marron Member, overlain by grey sandy mudstone, laminated dolomitic mudstone, and wackestone, arranged in three major shoaling upwards cycles (Mory et al., 2003; Gorter et al., 1994).

Each major shoaling cycle coarsens to ooid limestone and dolomite, with some sandstone and fragmentary fossil material. Gorter et al. noted some carbonate units in the middle part of the formation could be correlated between Tamala 1 and Quail 1, indicating extreme lateral persistence of stable conditions on a relatively fine scale. The Ajana Formation extends over most of the Gascoyne Platform, and thins away from a maximum in Dirk Hartog 17B.  Yasin and Mory (1999) suggested the Ajana Formation in Coburn 1 was deposited in marginal marine to non-marine playa lakes, with occasional marine incursions. The presence of dolomite and gypsum suggests evaporitic sabhkas rather than simply a lacustrine playa setting. Gorter et al. (1994) suggested marine influence increased upwards and towards the west and north. Each of the three major shoaling cycles within the formation may be a transgressive episode, culminating in higher energy marine conditions after lower energy restricted marine or non-marine deposition.  The Ajana Formation spans late Late Ordovician to late early Silurian (Llandovery, Telychian), based on conodont faunas from wells in the Shark Bay region.","The Ajana Formation extends over most of the Gascoyne Platform, and thins away from a maximum in Dirk Hartog 17B, although the exact thickness of that intersection is uncertain - Iasky and Mory (1999) specified a top at 970 m, but accompanying figures show it at about 1030 m, Gorter et al. (1994) gave 983 m, and the well completion report gave 1158 m as the top of the equivalent 'Unit C'. Iasky and Mory (1999, Appendix 4) identified complete intersections as follows: BHP ND 1, 223 - 302 m; BHP ND 2, 300 - 395.6 m; Coburn 1, 853 - 974 m; Dirk Hartog 17B, 970 - 1405 m; Hamelin Pool 1, 1289 - 1558 m; Tamala 1, 867 - 1118 m (plotted incorrectly at about 920 - 1118 m); Wandagee 1, 587 - 944 m; and Yaringa 1, 1300 - 1526 m (plotted correctly as 1271 - 1526 m).

815,39599,P_-WKal-o,797,Alcurra Dolerite,1,"Dolerite in dykes, sills, or plugs, with olivine gabbro, olivine norite, ferronorite, and ferrodiorite","The Alcurra Dolerite comprises basic and lesser intermediate intrusions formed at a late stage of the Giles Event, which occur as small bodies and dykes typically emplaced near the margins of, or peripheral to, older layered mafic intrusions (P_-WKG), and massive gabbro and co-mingled gabbro-granite intrusions (P_-WKH), of the Warakurna Supersuite. This suite is recognized on the BLACKSTONE, HOLT, FINLAYSON, and COOPER map sheets. Although previously coded P_-WKg3-, Howard et al. (2009) demonstrated a close geochemical and geochronological link between these small bodies and dykes, the dykes that form the Alcurra Dolerite dyke swarm, and the gabbros that host the orthomagmatic nickel-copper mineralization at the Nebo-Babel deposit south of the Jameson Range (COOPER). Accordingly, these authors grouped all of these rocks into a newly defined Alcurra Dolerite, subsequently recoded P_-WKal- (Howard et al., 2009). The unit typically includes fine- to medium-grained olivine gabbro, olivine norite, ferronorite, and ferrodiorite, and is commonly characterized by a  dual texture , comprising a porous framework of coarse-grained crystals, and a finer-grained and locally granophyric-textured matrix. Contact relationships broadly constrain the emplacement age of this unit to between c. 1073 and c. 1026 Ma, but direct dating of these intrusions indicates a narrower intrusive period, around c. 1067 Ma.","The basic and lesser intermediate intrusions of the Alcurra Dolerite, formed at a late stage of the Giles Event (P_-WKal-o), are found in the Blackstone syncline immediately south of the Blackstone Range (BLACKSTONE), where small, subvolcanic intrusions occur within slightly older volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of the Tollu Group. They also occur on HOLT and FINLAYSON, where they form small intrusions and dykes typically emplaced near the margins of, or peripheral to, the older layered mafic intrusions of the Warakurna Supersuite. A series of northeast-trending, coarse-grained ferrogabbro dykes belonging to the Alcurra Dolerite crosscuts the northwest part of the layered Jameson intrusion; some of these dykes show extensive copper-staining (e.g. GSWA 194405; WAROX site PMEMUG001109: MGA 357797E 7161020N). Throughout parts of BLACKSTONE and COOPER, the presence of these basic to intermediate intrusions under regolith cover can be inferred based on the coincidence of a high TMI and gravity response.","The name is derived from Alcurra Creek in northern South Australia (Edgoose et al., 2004).",,"The basic and lesser intermediate intrusions of the Alcurra Dolerite, formed at a late stage of the Giles Event (P_-WKal-o), typically include fine- to medium-grained olivine gabbro, olivine norite, ferronorite, and ferrodiorite.

In places, fine-grained rocks containing euhedral plagioclase phenocrysts are found, which represent rocks crystallized from the interstitial liquid that was more or less free of the components that formed the coarse-grained crystal framework.  The rocks are typified by evolved and Fe-rich tholeiitic compositions, resulting in physical properties such as a strong TMI response and high specific gravity.",,,,,"In the Blackstone syncline (BLACKSTONE), basic to intermediate intrusions of the Alcurra Dolerite have intruded into the layered, mafic, Giles intrusions (Blackstone intrusion: P_-WKG), and also the volcanic, volcaniclastic, and clastic rocks of the Kunmarnara and Tollu Groups.

","Known outcrops of the Angas Hills Formation are restricted to the southern half of the WEBB 1:250 000 scale map sheet area in WA, most notably around the Angas Hills. The unit is restricted to outliers of the Amadeus Basin lying within basement of the Arunta Orogen.","The name of the Angas Hills Formation is derived from Angas Hills (latitude 22&deg; 52  S, longitude 128&deg; 9  E) on the WEBB 1:250 000 map sheet area. Originally named Angas Hills beds (Blake and Towner, 1974; Blake, 1977). The name was changed to Angas Hills Formation and formallized by Haines et al. (2015).

Carbonate clasts were identified locally. The clayey sandstone matrix is friable and some exposures are limited to loose rounded pebbles and cobbles. Sandstone and mudstone are typically reddish-brown in colour due to iron oxides. Sandstones may be quartz-rich, but also contain a lithic content and clay matrix. Cross-beds are common in sandstone facies while mudstone is typically finely laminated.

The Anthiby Formation consists mainly of planar-laminated siltstone interbedded with thin fine- to medium-grained sandstone beds. The basal unconformity is locally marked by a thin pebble lag.

3418,524,P_-_ak-sk,1,Aralka Formation,1,"Siltstone, shale, limestone, dolomite, and minor sandstone; stromatolitic","The Aralka Formation is a unit of predominantly siltstone and shale, with lesser carbonate and sandstone that lies between the two Neoproterozoic glacigene succession (Areyonga and Olympic Formations) in the Amadeus Basin (Preiss et al., 1978). It forms the local top of Supersequence 2 of the Centralian Superbasin (Supersequence terminology of Walter et al., 1995). It is best exposed in the northeastern Amadeus Basin in the Northern Territory (NT). In Western Australia (WA) it is generally poorly exposed, with known outcrops restricted to the Boord Ridges and nearby areas (northeastern MACDONALD 1:250 000 map sheet area) where it was previously included in the now abandoned 'Boord Formation' (Haines et al., 2012; Haines and Allen, 2014). The Boord Ridges outcrops are notably stromatolitic, containing two forms  Atilanya fennensis  and  Tungussia inna , also recorded from outcrops the NT (Allen et al., 2016). The age of the unit is Cryogenian, approximately 660-640 Ma based on radiometric dating and on stratigraphic position relative to glaciations of known age.","The Aralka Formation is probably distributed throughout much of the Amadeus Basin, but is often covered, poorly exposed or locally removed by erosion. In the NT it is currently represented on published maps only in the northeast, but can be recognised in a number of drillholes and outcrops elsewhere. In the south and west of the NT Amadeus Basin it can be locally recognised as a component within the informal Inindia beds (for example near Mount Conner). In WA the only known outcrops are in the northern Boord Ridges (northeastern MACDONALD 1:250 000 map sheet area), and around a syncline a few kilometres to the west. It is likely to be more widespread in at least the northern half of the basin in the subsurface.","The Aralka Formation was defined by Preiss et al. (1978) with its type section in the northeast Amadeus Basin near Ringwood Homestead in the NT (ALICE SPRINGS 1:250 000 map sheet area). The name is derived from Mount Aralka in the HALE RIVER 1:250 000 map sheet area the east of the type section. The stratigraphic interval now incorporating the Aralka Formation was previously included in the Pertatataka Formation in the northeast Amadeus Basin, and was part of the now abandoned 'Boord Formation' in WA. The Aralka Formation has two named members, the Ringwood (stromatolitic carbonate and siltstone) and Limbla (sandstone and carbonate) Members, only mapped in the northeast Amadeus Basin (Preiss et al., 1978). While these members are not formally recognised in WA, the carbonate unit at the top of the Boord Ridges section may be at least partly coeval with the Ringwood Member; if so only the lower part of the formation, with respect to the type section, is preserved in the Boord Ridges area.",,"These descriptions of the lithology of the Aralka Formation are based on exposures along the northern limb of the Boord Ridges Syncline (Haines and Allen, 2014). Outcrop is generally very poor and covered by clayey soils, locally displaying weak trend lines on aerial imagery. Over the lower two-thirds of the unit, sparse outcrop is restricted to very weathered brown to greenish siltstone and shale, with rare outcrops of fine-grained sandstone. Bands of stromatolitic and intraclastic dolomite crop out intermittently along with very weathered siltstone rubble in the upper third of the formation. The formation is locally capped by a low strike ridge of stromatolitic sandy limestone, except where this unit has been removed by erosion beneath the unconformably overlying Olympic Formation.  The stratigraphically lower stromatolite horizons display isolated domical stromatolites ( Atilanya fennensis : Allen et al., 2016) ranging in diameter from several tens of centimetres to over 1 metre. Due to poor exposure the stromatolites are rarely intact; most commonly they are expressed as isolated piles of buff-coloured stromatolitic dolomite rubble spaced out in bedding-parallel trends surrounded by weathered siltstone float. The stromatolite horizons are commonly associated with beds of intraclastic dolomite and some stromatolites have clearly nucleated on clusters of tabular intraclasts. The parallel trends of isolated stromatolites are suggestive of multiple shallowing-upward cycles where the cycle tops coincide with water depths permitting stromatolite growth on a predominantly muddy substrate. At least 10, and possibly 12 cycles are present at the best exposed locality on the central northern limb of the Boord Ridges syncline (between MGA Zone 52 470687E 7421785N and 470612E 7421634N).  The ridge-forming limestone unit locally marking the top of the Aralka Formation is up to c. 50 m thick in the eastern Boord Ridges, but thins westward and disappears (around MGA Zone 52 470740E 7421430N) as the unconformity beneath the Olympic Formation cuts down through it to lie over the more recessive siltstone-dominated portion of the Aralka Formation. A small remnant of the carbonate unit is locally preserved further west. Large erratic boulders derived from this carbonate unit are incorporated into the overlying Olympic Formation. This ridge-forming unit is mainly comprised of pink sandy and intraclastic limestone, usually partly obscured by surface calcrete. Microbial laminations are common and aligned elongate bioherms typically 2 m long display irregularly branching columnar stromatolites ( Tungussia inna : Allen et al., 2016). The Aralka Formation is considered to have hydrocarbon source potential in the NT (Marshall, 2005; Ambrose et al., 2012; Munson, 2014), but deep-surface weathering precludes any assessment of its source potential or maturity from the Boord Ridges outcrops in WA (Haines et al., 2012; Haines &amp; Allen, 2014). ","Most of the Aralka Formation was deposited under quiet marine shelf conditions, below or at storm wave base, with evidence of shallowing in the upper part. The carbonate unit at the top of the Boord Ridges section was deposited under more enegetic shallow water conditions.  ",450,450,,"In the Boord Ridges the Aralka Formation overlies the Areyonga Formation with non-exposed contact, and is unconformably overlain by the Olympic Formation. In the NT the contact with the Areyonga is conformable, while the contact with the overlying Olympic Formation or Pioneer Sandstone is disconformable/unconformable (Preiss et al., 1978; Edgoose, 2013).",,17,,,,4,,,,660,,640,,"There is no geochronology on the Aralka Formation in WA. In the NT the basal Aralka Formation in Wallara 1 has been dated at 657.2 Â± 5.4 Ma based on Re-Os dating of organic-rich shale (Kendall et al., 2006).  The Aralka Formation fills the gap between the glacigene Areyonga and Olympic Formations, the local representitives of the Sturt and Elatina glaciations, respectively. Based on the assumption of global synchronicity of Neoproterozoic glaciations, the Aralka Formation can thus be constrained between c. 660-640 Ma using the most recent international geochronological constraints on the age of the enclosing glacial units (Rooney et al., 2015), consistent with the local age deterimation by Kendall et al.

It is characterized by glacial diamictite, but includes interbeds of sandstone, conglomerate, siltstone and carbonate in the NT. In Western Australia (WA), the very poor quality outcrop suggests that the formation is mainly diamictite, with minor conglomerate. Outcrop in WA is restricted to the Boord Ridges and nearby areas where the unit averages about 150 m in thickness. The Areyonga Formation is correlated with the Cryogenian Sturt glaciation ( Sturtian glaciation ) of the Adelaide Rift Complex and elsewhere (Hill et al., 2011). The age of the formation is Cryogenian, and can be further constrained to 720-660 Ma based on the dating of the Sturt glaciation internationally. The Areyonga Formation represents the local basal unit of Supersequence 2 of the Centralian Superbasin (Supersequence terminology of Walter et al., 1995).","Outcrops in WA are restricted the northeastern MACDONALD 1:250 000 scale map sheet area, specifically the Boord Ridges syncline and an unnamed syncline to its west.

The type section is at Ellery Creek (MACDONNELL RANGES 1:100 000 map sheet) in the NT where the unit is 250 m thick (Preiss et al., 1978).",,"The Areyonga Formation is very poorly exposed in WA. In the main exposure in the Boord Ridges it is expressed as low rises covered by loose clasts of chert, minor sandstone and quartzite (Haines and Allen, 2014). It supports little vegetation except along minor drainage channels. The chert clasts are typically pebble sized and angular, while the sparser sandstone and quartzite clasts reach cobble and boulder size, and display various degrees of rounding, facets and, rarely, striations and chatter marks indicative of glacial transport. Rare exposures in erosion gullies show pebble-sized angular chert clasts embedded in a pale grey mudstone matrix. Thus it appears that the rubble at surface is the expression of an underlying glacial diamictite dominated by chert clasts derived from the underlying silicified Wallara Formation and Bitter Springs Formation. The quartzite and sandstone are likely derived from the Heavitree Quartzite. Well-rounded and polished pebbles and cobbles are present locally, indicating the likely interbedding of conglomerate. In the Northern Territory, units of sandstone and dolomite are present locally, but such lithologies have no been observed in Western Australia.","Facets and striations on some clasts in indicate glacial transport (Haines and Allen, 2014). A variety of glacial and periglacial environments may be represented, but poor exposure in WA makes further subdivision of glacial environments equivocal.

It has been mapped in an elongate region that is 30 km long and 4 km wide on the western side of the complex, and makes up about 70% of its surface expression. Igneous layering is typically steeply east dipping, which suggests that the whole complex has been tilted, possibly during movement on the Youanmi Shear Zone to the east.","The middle zone of the Atley Igneous Complex lies to the west of the surface exposure of upper zone rocks. Interpreted units are up to four kilometres wide and taper to the south. They form a belt approximately 30 km long on WINDIMURRA. Geophysical modelling of the similar, nearby Youanmi Igneous Complex (15 km to the southwest) indicates that its middle zone is about 1.5 km in igneous stratigraphic thickness.

These were both coeval with volcanism of the Glen Group and intrude into upper levels of the Polelle Group sequence. The currently known occurences of the Austin Downs Supersuite are in the northern half of the Murchison Domain at least as far south as the Mount Magnet 1:100 000 sheet.",The currently documented extent of the Austin Downs Supersuite is in the northern half of the Murchison Domain. Close association with the Polelle Group host rocks produce a distribution similar to this group. The mafic-ultramafic components (i.e. the Yalgowra Suite) are to be found as layer-parallel sills intruding into rocks of the upper Polelle Group and hence they have a similar distribution to the upper part of this group. The metagranitic components (i.e. the Big Bell Suite) are located adjacent to greenstone belts in large 10-30 km long plutons primarily in the central parts of the Murchison Domain (i.e. the area from Cue to Mount Magnet).,"The supersuite is named after the Austin Downs homestead (Zone 50 MGA 573000E 6971000N) on CUE 1:100 000 mapsheet. The granites of the Big Bell Suite were previously classified as a 'High-Ca granite suite' (Champion and Cassidy, 2002). The Yalgowra Suite sills have previously been described (Watkins and Hickman, 1990), however these nor the supersuite as a whole, have been previously named.",,"Metagranitic rocks of the Big Bell Suite are more specifically metagranodiorite, metadiorite and metamonzogranite and metatonalite. These units are locally strongly sheared at their margins, which are typically in contact with highly strained metavolcanic rocks of the Polelle Group (Van Kranendonk, 2010). Characteristically, the plutons comprise 3-10 mm phenocrysts of variable amounts of quartz, feldspar and mafic minerals, all of which may locally show a porphyritic texture. Within the elongate plutons, the rocks are variably foliated and amphibole phenocrysts are locally pseudomorphed by metamorphic amphibole and form these foliation planes.  The contacts with greenstone belts are often sheared and the plutons are typically elongate along an antiformal hinge.  Thick differentiated mafic-ultramafic sills of the Yalgowra Suite are composed of layers of dunite and pyroxenite at their base, norite-gabbronorite, grading up into gabbro that may include leucogabbro with long feathery pyroxene crystals and local patches of pegmatitic leucogabbro at the top of the sill. Amphiboles of primary and secondary origin are also present in the upper parts of several of the sills. However, the primary amphiboles are thought to be a product of hydrous crustal contamination of an originally anhydrous magma. The thinner sills show weak differentiation from gabbronorite though gabbro to leucogabbro. Yalgowra Suite gabbros are typically deformed and metamorphosed at amphibolite facies close to their margins and in contact with Tuckanarra and Jungar Suite metagranites.",,,,,"The mafic intrusive components of the Austin Downs Supersuite, represented by the Yalgowra Suite, show sill tops with pegmatoidal leucogabbro which represents the quenched part of the sill several metres below it's top contact. This feature along with baked metasedimentary and volcanosedimentary host rocks of the upper part of the Polelle Group (Greensleeves Formation) can be seen at the following geochronology sample sites (MTWMAD000099, MTWCUE000094) and also at TJIMDG000429.

The unit is up to 1900 m thick and outcrops around the core of the Wanna Syncline between EDMUND and TEANO, and extends north of the Mount Vernon Fault on MOUNT VERNON and TANGADEE. The unit is exposed in the northeastern part of MILGUN, the Calyie Syncline and Mingah Springs Anticline on CALYIE, the Jamindi and Dunlop Anticlines and the Thompson Fault area on JAMINDI, the southern flank of the Beasley Syncline and near the Ski Fault on THREE RIVERS, around the Ashton Anticline, Collier Range, Backdoor Hills, and Cherry Synclines on CARDAWAN. The units is also exposed around the Brumby Creek and Glen Ross Anticlines on LOFTY RANGE, in northern parts of LOFTY RANGE and ILGARARI, around the Jaydinia Syncline, the Kumarina and Snake Faults area, and near the Unana Fault on WONYULGUNNA. In most areas the Backdoor Formation has an unconformable lower contact with the Coodardoo and Ullawarra Formations of the Edmund Group, except for JAMINDI and WONYULGUNNA where it has an unconformable lower contact with the Paleoproterozoic Bryah and Scorpion Groups, respectively. The upper contact with the Calyie Formation of the Collier Group is gradational and conformable. The age of the Backdoor Formation is poorly known, but it was probably deposited between c. 1171 and 1067 Ma.","The Backdoor Formation outcrops around the core of the Wanna Syncline on EDMUND, ELLIOTT CREEK, KENNETH RANGE, PEEDAWARRA, and TEANO, and extends north of the Mount Vernon Fault on MOUNT VERNON and TANGADEE. The unit is exposed in the northeastern part of MILGUN, the Calyie Syncline and Mingah Springs Anticline on CALYIE, the Jamindi and Dunlop Anticlines and Thompson Fault area on JAMINDI, the southern flank of the Beasley Syncline and near the Ski Fault on THREE RIVERS, around the Ashton Anticline, the Collier Range, Backdoor Hills, and Cherry Synclines on CARDAWAN.

The formation generally ranges in thickness from 1200 to 2300 m, but thins to about 500 m on eastern MOUNT VERNON and TANGADEE. The Formation has an interpreted thickness of 500-1400 m on CARDAWAN, 1400-1900 m on THREE RIVERS, 2002300 m on ILGARARI, and 350-3000 m on WONYULGUNNA. The anomalously thick succession (~3000 m) that appears to be present southwest of the Thomson Fault on JAMINDI (Cutten et al., 2013), north of the Collier Range Fault, and within the Jaydinia Syncline on WONYULGUNNA, may be due to structural repetition or an overestimation of thickness due to limited exposure in this area.","The Backdoor Formation was originally defined on the1:250 000 map sheet COLLIER to include the mostly argillaceous succession overlying either the Wonyulgunna Sandstone or basement rocks and underlying the Calyie Sandstone (Brakel and Muhling, 1976). It was formerly thought to be a lateral equivalent of units between the now abandoned Jillawarra and the Ullawarra Formations (Brakel and Muhling, 1976). Subsequently, this correlation was extended to include all units between the Jillawarra Formation and the Fords Creek Shale (Muhling and Brakel, 1985).  Martin et al. (1999) and Martin and Thorne (2002) assigned the thick, predominantly argillaceous rocks outcropping between the basal Collier Group unconformity and the Calyie Formation on the 1:250 000 map sheet EDMUND to the Backdoor Formation. This unit is equivalent to the Fords Creek Shale of Daniels (1966). The former correlations of Brakel and Muhling (1976) and Muhling and Brakel (1985) have not been adopted as most of the units thought to be equivalent to the Backdoor Formation can be proven to belong to the underlying Edmund Group.  The Backdoor Formation was named after the Backdoor Hills (Zone 50, MGA 709000E 7274000N), about 15 km northwest of Collier Range on CARDAWAN (Muhling and Brakel, 1985). The type area extends from north of the Backdoor Hills to the western end of the Collier Range (Zone 50, MGA 711500E 7261500N; Muhling and Brakel, 1985). Martin and Thorne (2002) suggested that the type section of the former Fords Creek Shale at Fords Creek West on KENNETH RANGE (Muhling and Brakel, 1985) provides a more appropriate type section for the revised Backdoor Formation. A representative section through the lower 860 m of the formation (Zone 50, MGA 464600E 7366100N to Zone 50, MGA 465700E 7366700N), southeast of Coodardo Gap on ELLIOTT CREEK has been summarized by Martin and Thorne (2002).",,"The Backdoor Formation (P_-MCb-sl) consists of laminated, green, maroon, and cream-coloured siltstone and mudstone, interbedded with subordinate very fine- to very coarse-grained sandstone, dolostone, and minor chert. More substantial thicknesses of sandstone, sandstone, siltstone, dolostone, and chert have been mapped as separate members (P_-MCb-st, P_-MCbj-st, P_-MCB-ss, P_-MCb-kd, P_-MCb-cl) of the formation. Goethite pseudomorphs and moulds after pyrite have been recorded from most lithologies and thin interbeds of very ferruginous, fine-grained sandstone are common. The Backdoor Formation is commonly strongly silicified, brecciated, and cut by quartz or red-black hematitic veinlets close to major faults, e.g. the Ski Fault on CARDAWAN.  Siltstone, dolostone, and chert generally form poorly exposed, recessive outcrops, whereas sandstone forms low hills and strike ridges and also appears as a capping on gentle dip slopes. The Backdoor Formation is intruded by discordant mafic sills belonging to the Kulkatharra Dolerite (P_-WKku-od).  Siltstone and very fine-grained sandstone are predominantly thinly bedded and parallel-planar to undulatory or ripple cross-laminated. They are commonly green due to the presence of weathered chlorite and glauconite and may elsewhere be carbonaceous, ferruginous, manganiferous, or calcareous. In thin section, the siltstones of the Backdoor Formation are characterized by fine laminae composed of microquartz and sericite, which are normally graded from very fine sand to fine silt (Martin et al., 2005).   Fine- to very coarse-grained sandstones are thinly to very thickly bedded with a tabular to lenticular bed geometry. Many beds are normally graded and are massive to parallel-planar laminated at the base and ripple cross-laminated at the top. Hummocky cross-stratification and small- to medium-scale trough cross-stratification are also recorded and many beds contain mudstone intraclasts. Bedding surfaces sometimes display primary current lineation and sole marks, including brush, bounce, and rare flute marks are common. Interference ripples, current ripples, flat-topped ripples, and rare starved ripples are also common in medium-grained sandstones in the upper Backdoor Formation (Martin et al., 2005). Massive to graded and trough cross-stratified, medium- to coarse-grained sandstones up to 1.2 m thick are most abundant in upper parts of the formation and mark the tops of upward-thickening and -coarsening intervals that are also characterized by increasing compositional maturity. These sandstones are commonly amalgamated into units up to 10 m thick. They are generally characterized by hummocky cross-stratification (Martin et al., 2005). Paleocurrent directions determined from sole marks and cross-stratification are consistently towards the southwest on ELLIOTT CREEK and KENNETH RANGE and towards the southwest and west-northwest on TEANO, TANGADEE, and CALYIE. Trace fossils of possible metaphytes, including 'strings of beads' ( Horodyskia , Grey and Williams, 1990; Grey et al., 2002, 2010) and impressions of microbial mats (Martin, 2003a) are also locally preserved on the soles of fine-grained sandstone beds.   Fine- to medium-grained sandstones in the lower Backdoor Formation are moderately sorted quartz arenites and lithic quartz arenites that consist of subangular to well-rounded quartz with syntaxial quartz cement (Martin et al., 2005). Grain compositions are dominated by monocrystalline quartz with minor chert and microquartz and trace amounts of detrital white mica, well-rounded tourmaline, and zircon. Opaque minerals, mainly very fine-grained hematite, are concentrated in specific laminae or disseminated throughout. Medium- to very coarse-grained sandstones in the upper Backdoor Formation also comprise moderately-sorted quartz arenites and lithic quartz arenites. Rounded to well-rounded grains of monocrystalline quartz (90-95%) with well-developed syntaxial quartz cement overgrowths predominate over lithic fragments (< 10%) that are dominated by microcrystalline quartz aggregates and trace amounts of tourmaline, zircon, plagioclase, and K-feldspar. Opaque oxides, mainly hematite, locally coat detrital grains and replace euhedral diagenetic pyrite. Aggregates of anhedral replacement carbonate are disseminated throughout some samples (Martin et al., 2005).  ","The laminated siltstones and very fine-grained sandstones that form the bulk of the Backdoor Formation are most likely to have been deposited below storm wave base on a distal siliciclastic shelf (Martin et al., 2005). Interbedded fine- to medium-grained sandstones in the lower Backdoor Formation are interpreted to be the product of storm-generated bottom currents that transported sediment offshore. Southwesterly directed paleocurrent data suggest a source area to the northeast of ELLIOTT CREEK and KENNETH RANGE, which is consistent with the sediment slumping to the south noted by Daniels (1966). Farther to the east on TANGADEE and CALYIE the data suggest a more westerly directed flow. Medium- to very coarse-grained, thick-bedded sandstones at the tops of upward-thickening packages in the lower Backdoor Formation and throughout the upper Backdoor Formation, were probably deposited close to or above storm wave base, as indicated by the presence of hummocky cross-stratification. Therefore, the Backdoor Formation records a progradation from distal shelf to proximal shelf and distal delta front depositional environments (Martin et al., 2005).",,2300,,"Throughout much of the Collier Basin, the Backdoor Formation has a sharp unconformable lower contact with the Coodardoo and Ullawarra Formations of the Edmund Group. In the southeast on JAMINDI it has an unconformable lower contact with the Paleoproterozoic Bryah Group and in the central part of WONYULGUNNA it has an unconformable lower contact with the Paleoproterozoic Scorpion Group. The contact with the overlying Calyie Formation is gradational and characterized by an increase in the proportion of interbedded sandstone.",,17,,,,4,,,,1171,,1067,,"The depositional age of the Backdoor Formation is poorly constrained, but probably took place between c. 1171 and 1067 Ma. The older age limit is provided by structural relationships that suggest that the formation was not affected by the 1321-1171 Ma Mutherbukin Tectonic Event (Korhonen et al., 2017). The younger age limit for the group comes from mafic sills of the 1084-1067 Ma Kulkatharra Dolerite, part of the c. 1075 Ma Warakurna Large Igneous Province (Wingate, 2002; Wingate et al., 2004), which intrude the succession. Martin (2003b) recorded the presence of a peperite margin along the contact between a mafic sill of the Kulkatharra Dolerite and lithic quartz wacke of the Backdoor Formation on KENNETH RANGE. This suggests that locally that the Kulkatharra Dolerite may have been intruded into unlithified or semilithified sediment relatively close to the younger age limit of c. 1067 Ma.  Ages given by the youngest components of detrital zircons in sandstone units present within the Backdoor Formation reflect the ages of the Capricorn Orogen basement. They are at least 450 Ma older than the likely older age limit for deposition. The youngest detrital zircon component in a sample collected from a sandstone outcropping from near the base of the Backdoor Formation, 2 km southeast of Edney Hill on MAROONAH (Zone 50, MGA 460580E 7389100N), has been dated at 1619 Â± 17 Ma (GSWA 156541, Wingate et al., 2007a), although the youngest zircon in this sample is 1603 Â± 23 Ma. Martin et al. (2008) determined a maximum depositional age of 1613 Â± 33 Ma from the same data. Wingate et al. (2007b) and Martin et al.

In addition, Wingate et al. (2007c) obtained a maximum depositional age of 1790 Â± 4 Ma from a sample of quartz sandstone, collected from an outcrop situated about 8 km southeast of Bend Bore on ELLIOTT CREEK (Zone 50, MGA 477155E 7373550N).

530,863,P_-BD-sz,1,Badgeradda Group,1,Sandstone; lesser siltstone and conglomerate,"The Badgeradda Group contains, in ascending order, the Bililly Formation, Woodrarrung Sandstone, Coomberarie Formation, and Yarrawolya Formation, and has been largely ignored since descriptions by Perry and Dickins (1960) and a review by Condon (1965). The Erabiddy Sandstone forms most of the Erabiddy Hills east of the main outcrop belt, and may correlate with the lower Woodrarrung Sandstone (Perry and Dickins, 1960) although Williams, I. R., et al. (1983) noted an exposure where the Erabiddy Sandstone apparently overlies Woodrarrung Sandstone. About 80 km north, Mount Rebecca and Earilier Hill and surrounding areas are mapped as Erabiddy Sandstone (Konecki et al., 1958; Williams, S. J., et al., 1983; Williams, I. R., et al., 1983).  The Badgeradda Group is dominated by large-scale shale-sandstone cycles, with lesser granule to pebble conglomerate. The zircon age distribution of a sample of Woodrarrung Sandstone is very similar to other sandstones at the base of the Neoproterozoic succession in central Australia, with a characteristic major peak at about 1100 Ma. If correct, then the overlying, poorly exposed, generally siltier Coomberarie Formation may correlate with units such as the middle and upper Buldya Group (Officer Basin) and the Bitter Springs Formation (Amadeus Basin), although carbonates and evaporites are lacking. The uppermost unit, the Yarrawolya Formation, is characterized by reddish, dominantly fine-grained sandstone distinct from the units below, and could be disconformable on older units or simply the product of a change in provenance and tectonism. The northwards paleocurrent pattern differs from the westwards pattern seen in the Woodrarung Sandstone. The underlying Nilling Formation is a mixed siltsone, shale, and sandstone unit, and was excluded from the group by Perry and Dickins (1960), who thought it was more deformed. Recent reconnaissance work suggests that the Nilling Formation is overlain with angular unconformity by the group.","The Badgeradda Group is preserved in two outliers at the northwest corner of the Yilgarn Craton. The main synclinal outcrop belt covers about 3900 km2, within which the group has a combined stratigraphic thickness of almost 3400 m, of which 2100 m is Coomberarie Formation. Beneath it, the Nilling Formation is possibly more than 1 km thick, although there may be considerable structural repetition by faulting and folding.",,,,"The Badgeradda Group is dominated by large-scale shale-sandstone cycles, with lesser granule to pebble conglomerate. Deposition was in coastal to deltaic settings, with fluvial facies preserved in the Bililly and Yarrawolya Formations.

The histogram of the entire zircon population is very similar to those of other sandstones at the base of the Neoproterozoic succession across Australia, inferring the group is Neoproterozoic. Alternatively, the group could correlate with the sand-rich Collier or Salvation Groups of central Western Australia. The microfossils are probably lyospheres, but have not been studied in detail and an age more specific than late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic is not possible from the present knowledge (K Grey, written comm., 2006).

The margin has developed a strong solid state deformation fabric and shearing has intercalated rafts of the older mafic and ultramafic rocks of the Coolgardie Subgroup. The granite is an elongate oval body of 46 km long, located west and northwest of Coolgardie in the Kalgoorlie Terrane. Two SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages for the granite are 2676 Â± 8 Ma and 2667 Â± 3 Ma.","The monzogranite forms an elongate to oval, north to south-trending body of approximately 542 square kilometres. The eastern margin is located approximately 13 km west of Coolgardie. The granite extends from near Jaurdi Hills (Zone 51, MGA 302408E 6604130N), southwards towards Kangaroo Hills (Zone 51, MGA 315680E 6561660N). Outcrops are typically weathered platforms exposed through a veneer of regolith and only about 5 % of the rock is exposed at the surface. The granite is located across the margin between the KALGOORLIE, and DUNNSVILLE, with a minor portion of the southern granite on the YILMIA AND WOOLGANGIE map sheets.  Champion and Cassidy (2002) subdivided the monzogranite into three zones on the basis of different aeromagnetic responses. Two areas, restricted to the eastern and northern area of the Bali Monzogranite, were called the Calf Skin Granite that was described as a massive to foliated biotite granite. The third area was limited to the southern margin of the Bali Monzogranite and was referred to as the Grossmont Granite. No geochemical data was available for these granites, and the brief lithological descriptions did not indicate any significant differences to warrant splitting them from the Bali Monzogranite. ","The name Bali Monzogranite was derived from dwellings of the Bali Homestead, which are sited just south of Great Eastern Highway at latitude -30&deg;58S and Longitude 121&deg;1E (Zone 51, MGA 311584E, 6571427N).",,"The Bali Monzogranite ranges from medium- to coarse-grained, to porphyritic rock. Around the margin of the granite a strong solid state deformation has developed, and locally preserves gradational recrystallization to fine-grained, inequigranular mildly augen-textured protomylonite (Hunter, 1993). Sheared mafic and ultramafic zones may be interleaved with the foliated monzogranite where juxtaposed with greenstones. The monzogranite is cross-cut by pink, fine-grained biotite monzogranite dykes, minor pegmatites and quartz veins.   Tabular, concentrically zoned microcline phenocrysts (1-3 cm) sit within an inequigranular matrix of calcic plagioclase, K-feldspar, quartz and biotite. Accessory phases include muscovite, chlorite, magnetite, zircon and apatite. The matrix may also contain rounded quartz crystals, or clusters. A petrographic description of the rock by Hunter (1993) indicates subhedral to euhedral megacrysts of microcline are encased with a hypidiomorphic granular matrix of calcic plagioclase, K-feldspar, quartz, and 2-3% biotite. Oscillatory zoning in the plagioclase has been weakly overprinted by saussuritization and a myrmekitic texture is scattered throughout the rock.   SiO 2  ranges from 73.10 - 75.70 wt %. Average values for Na 2 O and K 2 O are 4.83 wt% and 3.38 wt%, respectively. Yttrium values are generally low (<10ppm). Using the methodology of Champion and Cassidy (2002) the Bali Monzogranite is classified as a High-Ca granite. ",,,,,"The granite was intruded into mafic and ultramafic rocks of the Coolgardie Subgroup. The margin of the granite has subsequently been deformed and is locally sheared.

It lies adjacent to, and extends beneath, Lake Lightfoot, which is about 120 km southeast of the township of Laverton.   The Balpe Lakes Monzogranite is medium grained and contains minor biotite, muscovite and fluorite. It has a U-Pb SHRIMP zircon age of 2643 Â± 8 Ma (Wingate et al., 2010). Its chemistry is most likely similar to that of low-Ca granites seen elsewhere across the Yilgarn Craton (Cassidy et al., 2002). ","The Balpe Lakes Monzogranite lies on southern LIGHTFOOT and is adjacent to, and interpreted to extend beneath, Lake Lightfoot. In forms low rubbly outcrops, small whalebacks, and prominent hills. The most prominent outcrop is at Granite Hill (Zone 51, MGA 522500E 6749000N), which is the type locality.

The most prominent outcrop of the monzogranite, at Granite Hill, is the type locality. ",,"In outcrop, the Balpe Lakes Monzogranite is a pink, medium-grained, equigranular monzogranite that is predominantly massive, or has a spaced cleavage dipping to the south. However, a moderate to strong foliation is common at the margin of the monzogranite. A moderately plunging, south-southeasterly trending mineral lineation and S-C fabric is seen locally.   The Balpe Lakes Monzogranite is typically medium grained and comprises dominantly plagioclase, microcline, and quartz. It contains minor biotite, muscovite, fluorite, zircon and opaque minerals. There is some secondary alteration of biotite to chlorite and plagioclase to sericite (Peers, 1973; Wingate et al., 2010). Perthitic and myrmekitic textures are common. Rare outcropping xenoliths within the monzogranite include a raft of migmatitic orthogneiss (3 m &times; 2 m) at the base of Granite Hill (CEHLIG000022, Zone 51, MGA 522653E 6748896N), and a long, sinuous westerly trending sliver of metabasalt that is 2-2.5 m wide and more than 30 m long (CEHLIG000049, Zone 51, MGA 523776E 6747988N). Late-stage felsic pegmatite dykes crosscut the solid-state fabrics of the monzogranite.  Recrystallization textures and alteration in the Balpe Lakes Monzogranite suggest metamorphism in the greenschist facies. Geochemical data from the sample submitted for geochronology (GSWA 193361, Zone 51, MGA 521141E 6748590N) indicate that Balpe Lakes Monzogranite is a low-Ca granite in the scheme of Cassidy et al.

3759,34951,P_-ML-xs-k,1,Bangemall Supergroup,1,"Mixed siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks, chert, and minor volcanic rock","The Bangemall Supergroup equates to the former Bangemall Group. The main components are the Edmund Group and the overlying Collier Group, which are separated by a regional disconformity. The Bangemall Supergroup is mostly composed of mixed siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks. The lower part of the succession (Edmund Group) is subdivided into four depositional packages. This stratigraphy comprises fluvial to shallow- or deep-marine shelf deposits. The overlying Collier Group is subdivided into two depositional packages that record major marine transgression followed by delta progradation. The supergroup has a maximum thickness of about 11500 m and outcrops over a large part of the central Capricorn Orogen, covered by the YANREY, COLLIER, EDMUND, GLENBURGH, MOUNT EGERTON, MOUNT PHILLIPS, NEWMAN, PEAK HILL, ROBINSON RANGE, TUREE CREEK, WINNING POOL and WYLOO 1:250 000 map sheets. It unconformably overlies Paleoproterozoic and Archean rocks of the Capricorn Orogen and is unconformably overlain by the the Neoproterozoic Sunbeam Group, and by Phanerozoic deposits.  During Edmund Group deposition the character and distribution of the sedimentary rock types was strongly controlled by fluctuations in relative sea-level and intermittent synsedimentary extensional movement along major basement faults. In contrast, the Collier Group has a more uniform lithological character across the region, indicating that the synsedimentary fault movements were less significant. The Bangemall Supergroup was probably deposited between c. 1673 and 1070 Ma.  In the eastern Capricorn Orogen, the Scorpion and Salvation Groups are tentatively correlated with the Edmund and Collier Groups respectively. Both are sand-rich, shallower water deposits compared to the Edmund and Collier Groups. The Manganese Group is exposed on the eastern margin of the Pilbara Craton, and contains macrofossils ( Conophyton  and  Horodyskia ) suggestive of a correlation with the Collier Group.","The Bangemall Supergroup, as formally defined, outcrops over a large part of the central Capricorn Orogen. The Edmund and Collier Groups cover significant parts of the EDMUND and MOUNT EGERTON 1:250 000 map sheets, and also outcrop on the YANREY, COLLIER, GLENBURGH, NEWMAN, MOUNT PHILLIPS, PEAK HILL, ROBINSON RANGE, TUREE CREEK, WINNING POOL, and WYLOO 1:250 000 map sheets. The supergroup has an estimated maximum thickness of about 11 500 m. Farther east, the Scorpion and Salvation Groups lie between the Paleoproterozoic Earaheedy Basin and the Neoproterozoic Officer Basin on NABBERU, STANLEY, TRAINOR and BULLEN 1:250 000 map sheets, extending just onto PEAK HILL and ROBERTSON 1:250 000 map sheets, and have a similar apparent thickness. The Manganese Group is preserved east of the Pilbara Craton mainly on the ROBERTSON and BALFOUR DOWNS 1:250 000 sheets, with small outcrops on the NEWMAN and NULLAGINE 1:250 000 sheets. It is currently considered to be entirely equivalent to the Collier Group, but this correlation requires further confirmation.","The rocks comprising the Bangemall Supergroup were originally recognized as a stratigraphic entity by Woodward (1891). They were later named the Bangemall Series or Bangemall beds by Maitland (1909) after the former Bangemall Mining Centre on MOUNT PHILLIPS (Zone 50, MGA 445500E 7323000N). The name Bangemall Group, comprising the Top Camp Dolomite, Fords Creek Shale, and Kurabuka Formation, was used during the first phase of GSWA s systematic 1:250 000-scale geological mapping of the State during the 1960s (Halligan and Daniels, 1964). This stratigraphic framework for the Bangemall Group was subsequently used and revised by Brakel and Muhling (1976), Chuck (1984), and Muhling and Brakel (1985). These revisions resulted in the identification of the main Edmund and Collier Subgroups, as well as numerous additional subgroups, namely the Weegarinna, Florry, Dooley, Mucalana, Diebel, Manganese, Kahrban, and Scorpion Subgroups, most of which are now obsolete because they can be shown to be direct correlatives of the revised Edmund or Collier Groups. The Bangemall Group was later raised to supergroup status, and its constituent sub-groups to group status, by Martin et al. (1999) and Martin and Thorne (2002) following the recognition of a major unconformity between lower and upper parts of the stratigraphy (Cooper et al., 1998). No type area has been specified, but the formally defined Bangemall Supergroup is well developed on the EDMUND, MOUNT EGERTON, and COLLIER 1:250 000 map sheets (Martin and Thorne, 2002).   The current stratigraphic subdivision of the Bangemall Supergroup in the central and western Capricorn Orogen follows that of Martin and Thorne (2002). Under this scheme the supergroup is subdivided into the Edmund Group and the unconformably overlying Collier Group. In the east, the Scorpion and Salvation Groups are tentatively correlated with the Edmund and Collier Groups respectively (Hocking et al., 2000; Hocking and Jones, 2002), and in the northeast the Manganese Group is considered to be mostly equivalent to the Collier Group based on the presence of  Horodyskia  macrofossils (Grey et al., 2002; Grey et al., 2010) and  Conophyton  stromatolites (Williams, 1990). Although these units were previously wholly or partly recognised as subgroups of the former Bangemall Group (Chuck, 1984; Muhling and Brakel, 1985; Williams, 1990) were not formally included in the redefined Bangemall Supergroup (Martin and Thorne, 2002), primarily due to uncertainties in age constraints and detailed correlation. The Uaroo Group (van de Graaf et al., 1980) was never formally recognised as a constitiuent of the Bangemall Group, but previous workers (e.g. Muhling and Brakel, 1985; Williams, 1990) and current mapping (on YANREY) indicate that it is a direct correlative of the Edmund Group, and thus has been abandoned.  Martin and Thorne (2004) and Martin et al. (2008) used the term 'depositional package' in order to describe the tectonic evolution of the Edmund and Collier Basins, the depositional settings for the Edmund and Collier Groups. Under this scheme the fourteen lithostratigraphic formations of the Edmund and Collier Groups are arranged into six depositional packages which represent discrete stages in basin development. The lower packages make up the Edmund Group and consist of (in ascending stratigraphic order): Depositional package 1 (Yilgatherra and Irregully Formations), Depositional package 2 (Gooragoora, Blue Billy, and Cheyne Springs Formations), Depositional package 3 (Kiangi Creek and Muntharra Formations), and Depositional package 4 (Discovery, Devil Creek, Ullawarra, and Coodardoo Formations). The remaining two packages, namely Depositional package 5 (Backdoor and Calyie Formations) and Depositional package 6 (Ilgarari Formation) make up the Collier Group.",,"The Bangemall Supergroup in the western and central Capricorn Orogen is a mixed siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary succession and is subdivided into a lower Edmund Group and an upper Collier Group which are further subdivided into 'depositional packages' in order to describe the tectonic evolution of the Edmund and Collier Basins and the depositional settings for the Edmund (packages 1-4) and Collier (packages 5 and 6) Groups. Lithological correlations in the eastern and northeastern parts of the orogen have not yet been formallised.  Depositional package 1 consists of siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks of the Yilgatherra and Irregully Formations. The Yilgatherra Formation is an upward-fining succession in which lower levels are composed of sandstone and conglomerate, whereas upper levels contain increased amounts of siltstone. Minor dolostone is also present near the top of the formation. The principal lithologies in the overlying Irregully Formation are laminated and stromatolitic dolostone, dolarenite, and dolorudite, together with sandstone, dolomitic sandstone, quartz pebble conglomerate, and laminated siltstone. Considerable thicknesses of quartz sandstone and siltstone are also interbedded with the dolostone in areas south of the Talga and Mount Vernon Fault system.  Depositional package 2 consists of siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks of the Gooragoora, Blue Billy, and Cheyne Springs Formations. The Gooragoorra Formation is composed of fine- to very coarse grained quartz sandstone, feldspathic sandstone and siltstone, together with minor conglomerate. Significant thicknesses of cross-stratified sandstone and minor amounts of dolostone and dolomitic siltstone are also present in upper parts of the stratigraphy. Rocks belonging to the Blue Billy Formation consist primarily of parallel-planar laminated, black, pyritic, carbonaceous, and fissile to flaggy siltstone that weathers to a blue-grey colour. The formation also contains thick-bedded, massive, medium- to coarse-grained quartz sandstone, dolomitic sandstone, and pebbly sandstone and minor dolomitic siltstone, thin-bedded dolostone, and black chert are present in upper parts of the formation. The Cheyne Springs Formation comprises interbedded dololutite, dolarenite, dolorudite, mudstone, siltstone, and sandstone. Dolostones are most abundant in lower parts of the stratigraphy, whereas the proportion of sandstone increases towards the top.  Depositional package 3 consists of fine- to coarse-grained siliciclastic rocks of the Kiangi Creek and Muntharra Formations. Major rock types in the Kiangi Creek Formation are siltstone, fine- to very coarse-grained sandstone, and dolostone, together with minor conglomerate, and chert. The formation also contains two felsic volcanic units that together make up the Tangadee Rhyolite member. In general, the coarser grained siliciclastic rocks dominate the lower part of the formation whereas siltstone and fine-grained sandstone is most abundant in upper levels. Dolomitic rocks are most abundant on the Pingandy Shelf, north of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system. The Muntharra Formation consists mainly of dolostone and stromatolitic dolostone, together with sandstone, dolomitic sandstone, and siltstone. The dolostones form thin to very thick bedded tabular units and are generally composed of either massive to laminated dololutite, or weakly laminated dolarenite. Stromatolitic dolostones are dominated by very thick bedded  Conophyton  biostromes.  Depositional package 4 consists mainly of fine grained siliciclastic sedimentary rocks and minor dolostones and sandstones of the Discovery, Devil Creek, Ullawarra, and Coodardoo Formations. Rocks belonging to the Discovery Formation are composed of massive or laminated grey or black chert, together with silicified mudstone and siltstone. Minor occurrences of silicified sandstone and conglomerate are also present in the northwestern part of the Edmund Basin. The Devil Creek Formation comprises non-stromatolitic and stromatolitic dolostone, dolostone breccia, dolomitic siltstone and siltstone, and minor diagenetic chert. Thick layers of chert breccia have been mapped in the upper part of the formation on KENNETH RANGE and major occurrences of siltstone are recorded south of the Talga and Mount Vernon Fault system in central and eastern parts of the Edmund Basin. The main lithologies in the Ullawarra Formation are siltstone, together with subordinate fine-grained sandstone, dolostone, and chert. Substantial thicknesses of fine- to coarse-grained sandstone are interbedded with the siltstone in areas south of the Talga and Mount Vernon Faults and have been mapped as separate members (Curran and Nanular Members) of the formation. In addition, a thick unit of ferruginous and manganiferous siltstone has been mapped on JAMINDI and a localized occurrence of dolostone has been recognized on KENNETH RANGE. Minor deposits of felsic volcanic volcaniclastic rock have also been mapped within the Ullawarra Formation on MILGUN and CALYIE. The Coodardoo Formation, the uppermost unit in the Edmund Group, is composed of thin- to very thick-bedded, fine- to very coarse-grained lithic quartz sandstone and pebbly sandstone, interbedded with siltstone.  The remaining two packages, namely Depositional package 5 (Backdoor and Calyie Formations) and Depositional package 6 (Ilgarari Formation) make up the Collier Group, and consist of fine- to very coarse-grained siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. The Backdoor Formation, the lowermost unit in the Collier Group is composed of siltstone and thin- to thick-bedded sandstone, together with minor dolostone and chert. The proportion of sandstone increases towards the top of the formation and it has a transitional contact with the cross-stratified or massive fine- to very coarse-grained sandstones belonging to the Calyie Formation. The Igarari Formation, at the top of the Collier Group is dominated by siltstone and thin-bedded, fine-grained sandstone.  Despite many of the rocks of the Edmund Group being weak to moderately deformed, they are all essentially unmetamorphosed; however, rare, weakly metamorphosed rocks are locally present. Schistose metasandstones and metasiltstones (P_-MEy-mts) that are located below the Irregully Formation in the Woodlands Dome on MULGUL, have tentatively been assigned to the Yilgatherra Formation, and low- to medium-grade schistose metasedimentary rocks (P_-MEk-mh, P_-MEd-ml, P_-MEv-mk, P_-MEl-mlsd) on PINK HILLS are recognized as being metamorphosed equivalents of the Kiangi Creek, Discovery, Devil Creek, and Ullawarra Formations.","In the western and central Capricorn Orogen, the Bangemall Supergroup comprises mixed fluvial to shallow- or deep-marine shelf deposits that were laid down during periods of fluctuating relative sea level. During deposition of the Edmund Group the nature of the sedimentary facies was also strongly controlled by synsedimentary extensional movement along major basement faults. In contrast, these basement faults were less significant during deposition of the Collier Group.   Much of Depositional package 1 (Yilgatherra and Irregully Formations, Edmund Group) records a fluctuating history of relative sea level change that appears to have been significantly controlled by extensional movement on reactivated basement structures, e.g. the Talga, Mount Vernon, and Lyons River Faults, which created a half-graben basin structure. During this time thin peritidal platform carbonates were deposited on the Pingandy Shelf, whereas thick slope, marine, and fluvial deposits were laid down in areas further south. Depositional package 2 (Gooragoora, Blue Billy, and Cheyne Springs Formations) was deposited during a rise in relative sea-level and drowning of the Edmund Basin, including the Pingandy Shelf (Martin and Thorne, 2004; Cutten et al., 2016). In contrast to Depositional package 1, major basement structures had little influence on sedimentation.  Depositional package 3 (Kiangi Creek and Muntharra Formations) was laid down following a period of relative uplift, caused by vertical fault movement and erosion that stripped package 2 from much of the western and southern Edmund Basin. Thick alluvial, deltaic, and deep-marine sandstones within the lower Kiangi Creek Formation are associated with large, basin-scale faults and suggest that Kiangi Creek Formation sedimentation began with the infill and burial of a half-graben basin architecture. Two areas of fluvio-deltaic and shallow-marine shelf sedimentation have been identified at this time: northeast of the Talga Fault on the Pingandy Shelf, and in the Coobarra Dome - Jillawarra Sub-basin area south of the Bujundunna and Quartzite Well Faults. Upper levels of the Kiangi Creek Formation record a regional flooding and widespread fine-grained deep-marine sedimentation whereas the overlying Muntharra Formation was deposited in response to a shallowing and waning of siliciclastic input along the Pingandy Shelf.  Depositional package 4 (Discovery, Devil Creek, Ullawarra, and Coodardoo Formations) was deposited following a major marine transgression that crossed the region from southwest to northeast (Martin and Thorne, 2004). Localized thin, coarse-grained deposits at the base of the Discovery Formation are overlain by deep-marine sulfidic mudstone and chert. During this time there appears to have been no significant movement along the major basinal structures. A more significant reactivation of the Talga, Mount Vernon, Quartzite Well, and Lyons River Faults took place during deposition of the overlying Devil Creek and Ullawarra Formations. This event was accompanied by a change to a southeasterly sediment source, with an additional contribution from the northwest taking place during deposition of the Coodardoo Formation.  Deposition of the Collier Group was preceded by an interval during which the Edmund Group was intruded by dolerite sills at c. 1465 Ma (Wingate, 2002) and then folded and uplifted during the 1321-1171 Ma Mutherbukin Tectonic Event (Kohornen et al., 2017). Collier Group sedimentation (Depositional package 5: Backdoor and Calyie Formations) records an early period of carbonate shelf sedimentation, followed by a major marine transgression and then by the progradation of a sand-dominated delta complex where sediment was derived from the northeast and southeast. Deltaic sedimentation was terminated abruptly by a marked rise in relative sea-level and a transgression that blanketed the region in deep-marine shelf siltstone belonging to Depositional package 6 (Ilgarari Formation).",,11500,,"The Bangemall Supergroup unconformably overlies the Paleoproterozoic Gascoyne Province, Capricorn, Wyloo, Bresnahan, and Mount Minnie Groups, and Archean to early Paleoproterozoic basement (including the Fortescue and Hamersley Groups) in the northern Capricorn Orogen. It also unconformably overlies the Paleoproterozoic Bryah, Padbury, and Earaheedy Groups, and the Yarlarweelor Gneiss Complex, and Archaean basement (Marymia Inlier) to the south. The nature of the lower contact with the Mount Augustus Sandstone is unclear as it is generally either faulted or not exposed. The Supergroup is unconformably overlain in turn by the Neoproterozoic Sunbeam Group, and by Phanerozoic deposits that include the Carboniferous - Permian Paterson Formation and Lyons Group, extensive Cenozoic deposits and, in the north, Cretaceous deposits.",,17,,,Mixed,1,,,,1673,,1067,,"The Bangemall Supergroup was probably deposited between c. 1673 and 1070 Ma based on the likely maximum age of the Edmund Group (Martin et al., 2008) and the age of the Kulkatharra Dolerite (Wingate, 2002), that intrudes the middle Edmund Group and uppermost part of the Collier Group. The Edmund Group is also intruded by the 1517-1505 Ma Waldburg Dolerite and the c. 1465 Ma Narimbunna Dolerite. However, neither of these units intrude the Collier Group.  The older age limit for the Edmund Group is provided by the age of the youngest detrital zircons of c. 1673 Ma from sandstones of the Yilgatherra Formation at the base of the group. Locally the Irregully Formation unconformably overlies granitic rocks of the 1680-1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite in the Gascoyne Province (Sheppard et al., 2010). The Discretion Granite on MARQUIS is the youngest granite in the Durlacher Supersuite and has been dated at 1619 Â± 15 Ma (GSWA 142855, Nelson, 1998; Sheppard et al., 2010). However, the boundary between the Discretion Granite and the overlying lower Edmund Group is faulted and the true nature of the contact, whether it is intrusive or unconformable, cannot be determined.  The minimum age of c. 1455 Ma for the Edmund Group is derived from the ages of felsic volcaniclastic rocks within the Ullawarra Formation, and also from the age of the Narimbunna Dolerite which intrudes the Edmund Group stratigraphy. Wingate et al. (GSWA 149031, 2010a) and Wingate et al. (GSWA 143440, 2012a) obtained maximum depositional ages of 1463 Â± 8 Ma and 1455 Â± 9 Ma from felsic volcaniclastic units within the Ullawarra Formation on MILGUN and CALYIE, respectively. These ages are interpreted to be close to the actual depositional age. In addition, Wingate (GSWA 148994, 2010b) acquired an age of 1461 Â± 7 Ma from the youngest age component of detrital zircons in a sandstone sample, taken from the Ullawarra Formation on PEEDAWARRA. The ages obtained from the Ullawarra Formation are within uncertainty of the c. 1465 Ma age of the Narimbunna Dolerite (Wingate, 2002; Martin et al., 2005) and indicate that dolerite intrusion, felsic volcanism, and Ullawarra Formation sedimentation were essentially coeval (GSWA 149031, Wingate et al., 2010a).  The minimum age for the lower Edmund Group (Yilgatherra to Gooragoora Formations) is given by age of mineralization in the Irregully and Gooragoora Formation host rocks at the Abra polymetallic deposit. This event has been dated to between c. 1610 and 1590 Ma, based on the U-Pb age of hydrothermal xenotime within the deposit (Zi et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2015). Sills belonging to the Waldburg Dolerite are intruded into the Kiangi Creek Formation and lower parts of the Edmund Group on MOUNT AUGUSTUS, MANGAROON, and CANDOLLE. These sills have igneous crystallization ages of 1517-1505 Ma (GSWA 20916, Wingate 2015; GSWA 143445, Wingate et al., 2012b) and provide a younger age limit for the Blue Billy, Cheyne Springs, and Kiangi Creek Formations.   The age of deposition of the Collier Group is poorly constrained but probably lies between c. 1171 and 1070 Ma. The older age limit is provided by structural relationships that suggest that the Collier Group was not affected by the 1321-1171 Ma Mutherbukin Tectonic Event (Korhonen et al., 2015, 2017). The younger age limit for the group comes from sills of the Kulkatharra Dolerite, which intrude the succession and are related to the c. 1070 Ma Warakurna Large Igneous Province (Wingate et al., 2002).",No,,,285,,No,PM Approved,No,No,P_,ML,,13,6,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

It is interpreted to be an impact melt derived from the in situ melting of the underlying Yarrabubba Monzogranite due to the force and heat of the meteorite impact event. The granophyre contains xenoliths of partly melted, coarse-grained granitic rock, along with local rounded quartz xenocrysts and feldspar, set in a skeletal-textured groundmass comprising needle-like quartz and feldspar crystals. The age of the Barlangi Granophyre and the associated impact event are poorly constrained, but are believed to date to between c. 2647 and 1210 Ma.","The Barlangi Granophyre outcrops near the middle of the main body of the Yarrabubba Monzogranite within the central demagnetized zone of the Yarrabubba meteorite crater. The main outcrop is at Barlangi Rock, about 1 km east of the large Yarrabubba Monzogranite body. However, there are also sparse outcrops located to the north, west, and southwest. The contact with the surrounding monzogranite has mainly been deduced from aeromagnetic data. The granophyre forms distinctive terraces, in contrast to the boulder outcrops of the surrounding monzogranite.","The Barlangi Granophyre is named after Barlangi Rock (Cassidy et al., 2002), a prominent outcrop of the granophyre that was first published in a formal sense by Macdonald et al. (2003).",,"The Barlangi Granophyre is a pink, fine- to medium-grained monzogranite, which contains xenoliths of coarse-grained granitic rock, ranging from a few centimetres to several tens of centimetres in size, and rounded, partly resorbed xenocrysts of quartz and feldspar. The granophyre has a groundmass of needle-like quartz and feldspar crystals (up to 3 mm long) that tend to radiate outwards from the larger, more rounded quartz and feldspar xenocrysts (Bunting, 2007). Such needle-like crystal forms are typical of rapid cooling, as might be expected of an impact melt.  The Barlangi Granophyre is believed to have formed by melting of the Yarrabubba Monzogranite due to the force and heat of the meteorite impact. Geochemical analysis of the Barlangi Granophyre and Yarrabubba Monzogranite shows virtually identical trace-element and rare earth element (REE) compositions with no indication of fractionation (Cassidy et al., 2002), which further supports this interpretation.   The granophyre locally shows distinctive columnar jointing or fracturing, in places forming steps of up to 2 m high. There are no planar deformation features (PDFs), pseudotachylite, or other shock deformation features associated with the Barlangi Granophyre (Bunting, 2007).",,,,,"The contact relationship between the Yarrabubba Monzogranite and the Barlangi Granophyre (AP_-_bg-gv) is poorly exposed, but it typically appears to be a shallow-dipping, intrusive contact.",,17,,,,4,,,,2647,,1210,,"Attempts to date the Barlangi Granophyre by U-Pb SHRIMP zircon dating returned inconclusive results (Cassidy et al., 2002; Nelson, 2005).

Group 1 contains a coherent group of four analyses from four zircons, providing a weighted mean &sup2;Pb*/&sup2;Pb* date of 2647 Â± 11 Ma. This group was interpreted having derived from zircons from the Yarrabubba Monzogranite. Group 2 contains eight concordant to highly discordant analyses from eight zircons, yielding a weighted mean &sup2;Pb*/&sup2;Pb* date of 2689 Â± 7 Ma.

The maximum age is provided by the youngest inherited zircon population of 2647 Â± 11 Ma (Nelson, 2005). The minimum age is poorly constrained and is given by the youngest possible age of the Proterozoic dolerite dykes that crosscut the Yarrabubba Monzogranite intrusion.

1064,74849,A-ANbm-xony-am,571,Barrambie Igneous Complex,1,Layered gabbro and anorthosite with magnetitite and pyroxenitic layers; metamorphosed,"The Barrambie Igneous Complex is a mafic-ultramafic layered intrusion belonging to the Meeline Suite (Ivanic et al. 2010). It is the easternmost complex of the Meeline Suite, within the central Youanmi Terrane, western Yilgarn Craton. The Complex forms a 59 km long, 5.8 km wide (~220 km2), steeply dipping, lens-shaped body exposed along the Youanmi Shear Zone. It comprises approximately 4 km thickness of igneous cumulate stratigraphy and is tilted with way-up to the east. The Barrambie Igneous Complex shares most lithological affinity with the Atley Igneous Complex from which it is located about 80 km to the north and it is about 25 km to the southeast of the Lady Alma Igneous Complex. Most exposed rocks of this complex have an upper zone affinity, but due to poor exposure of more magnesian rocks, this complex is not divided into zones. Geochemically, this complex is thought to be anhydrous and tholeiitic (Ivanic et al. 2010). The upper parts of the complex host significant vanadiferous magnetitite horizons.","The Complex is 59 km long and 5.8 km wide, steeply dipping, aligned north-northwest along the Youanmi Shear Zone and tapering to the north and south. It crosses from the RAYS ROCK to YOUNO DOWNS to NOWTHANNA map sheets with its main exposures situated a few kilometres north and south of Barrambie Well.","This complex has previously been referred to as the Barrambie Complex (Mathison and Ahmat, 1996) and is named as an igneous complex in Ivanic et al., (2010). It is named after Barrambie Homestead (Zone 50, MGA 710527E 6963025N).  The type section is located 2.5 km northwest of Barrambie homestead (abd.) from site SFCS623A (Zone 50 MGA 715218E 6955175N) to site SXWIAS000030 (Zone 50 MGA 714357E 6956860N). Here it contains a variety of mafic cumulate and non-cumulate lithologies, for example: anorthosite interlayered with gabbro, gabbronorite, dolerite, coarse-grained leucogabbro, magnetitite, magnetite gabbro and pegmatitic gabbro. Way up to the east is interpreted from observations of meso-scale gradational modal layering (Ivanic et al. 2010). A short traverse up the rise along this traverse crosses plagioclase-rich metagabbro (Zone 50 MGA 714360E 6956860N) with cumulus plagioclase crystals up to 10 mm and less abundant, coarse, interstitial pyroxene (now replaced by actinolite). Local outcrops of pegmatitic metagabbro contain large (up to 12 cm) crystals of altered clinopyroxene. There are also lenses and pods of meta-anorthosite. Farther up the rise there are more outcrops of mafic meta-pegmatite and metagabbro. The first layer of magnetitite is underlain in the slope by metapyroxenite (Zone 50 MGA 714215E 6956760N). The magnetitite layers are typically 2-3 m thick and are cumulates with crystals (1-2 mm in size) of vanadium-bearing titaniferous magnetite (altered to martite). Across the rise, layers of magnetitite are separated by metagabbro and there are local patches of magnetite-bearing meta-anorthosite. Small enclaves of finer-grained mafic rock may be host rocks that have been caught up in the intrusion, or dolerite intrusions, or remnants of a doleritic border zone. Magnetitite layers on top of the rise are vertical to steeply east dipping.",,"The complex contains gabbro, magnetite gabbro, gabbronorite, dolerite and magnetitite with lesser anorthosite, magnetite anorthosite, and pegmatitic gabbro. In its upper parts, the more felsic lithologies contain accessory quartz, apatite, and opaque oxides. Gabbroic rocks typically have 5-9 mm plagioclase cumulate crystals and 8-20 mm pyroxene oikocrysts. In the gabbro, clinopyroxene oikocrysts have been partly replaced by actinolitic amphibole. Peridotite is present, but poorly exposed in the westernmost part of the complex. This unit is pervasively serpentinized in most parts. Apatite and ilmenite are present as accessory phases in the eastern parts of the complex, associated with magnetite gabbro units. Chlorite, actinolite, tremolite, serpentine and epidote are common secondary minerals in this Complex. No detailed study of the whole-rock chemical variation across the complex has been conducted.  Magnetitites are typically altered to martite, goethite, ilmenite, and rutile, especially adjacent to laterites. Grain size may be up to 8 mm. The ilmenite originally occurred as exsolution lamellae or graphic intergrowths with magnetite, or as discrete, possibly primary, grains. Vanadium occurs in solid solution with magnetite and ilmenite, which are the main ore minerals. Ward, (1975) described an indicated vanadium resource for the Barrambie Igneous Complex of 27 Mt at 0.7% V2O5, with 15% TiO2, and 26% Fe. More recent estimates of the inferred resources are approximately 48 Mt at 0.496% V2O5 and 22% TiO2 (www.neometals.com.au/titanium.php) .",,,,,"The Barrambie Igneous Complex appears to intrude strongly altered and deformed greenstones that include metamorphosed banded iron-formation, pelitic siliciclastic rocks and quartz-chlorite(-sericite) schist that may be derived from sedimentary or felsic volcanic rocks (Tingey, 1985; Chen et al., 2006).

The most complete section is preserved on the southeastern closure of the Wyloo Dome where Trendall (1979) recorded a measured thickness of ~400 m.","The Beasley River Quartzite was established by MacLeod et al. (1963) as part of the then newly defined Wyloo Group, the uppermost unit of the Mount Bruce Supergroup. This nomenclature was later followed by de la Hunty (1964), Halligan and Daniels (1964), Daniels (1970), and Trendall (1975).  The recognition of a major unconformity within the lower part of the Wyloo Group prompted significant revision of the Mount Bruce Supergroup (Trendall, 1979). The Turee Creek Formation (the lower formation in the Wyloo Group), and the lower part of the Beasley River Quartzite, were combined to form a new stratigraphic unit &mdash; the Turee Creek Group. As a consequence, the Mount Bruce Supergroup was restructured to include the Fortescue, Hamersley and Turee Creek Groups. The Wyloo Group was regarded as a separate lithological entity whose lowermost formation, the redefined Beasley River Quartzite, unconformably overlies the Mount Bruce Supergroup.  Horwitz (1980) recognized the presence of a regional disconformity at the top of the Cheela Springs Basalt, the stratigraphic unit overlying the Beasley River Quartzite, however its temporal significance was unknown and did not lead to a redefinition of the Wyloo Group (Seymour et al., 1988; Thorne and Seymour, 1991). More recently, a c. 2208 Ma mafic magmatic event, responsible for deposition of the Cheela Springs Basalt and coeval dolerite intrusion into the Beasley River Quartzite and underlying Turee Creek Group, has been identified and provides a reliable age for the lower part of the Wyloo Group (Martin et al., 1998; M&uuml;ller et al., 2005; Martin and Morris, 2010). In contrast, the maximum age of the upper Wyloo Group is fixed by ages of c. 2030 Ma and c. 2008 Ma that were published for the Wooly Dolomite and for dolerite dykes that post-date the lower Wyloo Group but pre-date the Mount McGrath Formation (M&uuml;ller et al., 2005). These data show there was a hiatus of at least 200 Ma between deposition of the lower and upper parts of the Wyloo Group. This in turn has led to a revision of the Wyloo Group, with the lower Wyloo Group (Beasley River Quartzite, Cheela Springs Basalt) now assigned to the Shingle Creek Group, and the upper Wyloo Group (Mount McGrath Formation, Duck Creek Dolomite, June Hill Volcanics, and Ashburton Formation) retained within the revised Wyloo Group. The c. 2030 Ma age for the Wooly Dolomite indicates that this unit was laid down in the interval between deposition of the Shingle Creek and Wyloo Groups.  The name Beasley River Quartzite was presumably taken from the Beasley River (Zone 50, MGA 498000E 7462000N) on ROCKLEA and southeastern HARDEY. The type area for the formation is around the southeastern closure of Wyloo Dome on the western part of HARDEY (Halligan and Daniels, 1964). Trendall (1979) specified a type section in this area at Zone 50, MGA 461990E 7480720N, and a reference section at Zone 50, MGA 456550E 7478620N.",,"The Beasley River Quartzite is composed of fine- to coarse-grained, silicified quartz sandstone, together with lesser amounts of ferruginous conglomerate, sandstone and pebbly sandstone, siltstone, and dolomite. The formation is intruded by numerous sills of Balgara Dolerite. The thickest accumulation of ferruginous conglomerate and pebbly sandstone occurs at the base of the formation, near the southeastern closure of the Wyloo Dome, and has been named the Three Corner Conglomerate Member (P_-SKqt-sc; Trendall, 1979). Much of the Beasley River Quartzite is resistant to weathering and erosion and outcrops as prominent hills and strike ridges.  Published descriptions of the Beasley River Quartzite are given by Trendall (1979), Thorne and Seymour (1991), Martin et al. (2000), and Mazumder and Van Kranendonk (2013). The following description is based largely on the work of Thorne and Seymour (1991).  Fine- to coarse-grained (mostly medium-grained) quartz sandstone is characterized by a wide variety of internal structure. Medium- to thick-bedded units are dominated by medium- to very large-scale trough cross-stratification with subordinate parallel- or ripple-lamination. These stratification types occur in stacked lenticular cosets, 1-3 m thick and 10-40 m wide. Cosets generally consist of 0.1 - 1.5 m thick sets of trough cross-strata, deformed into ball-and-pillow structures where there are local marked differences in grain size between superimposed sets. Thicker cosets show an upward decrease in grain size and scale of cross-stratification, and may incorporate 0.1 - 0.5 m thick intervals of parallel-laminated or gently inclined, planar-laminated fine-grained sandstone. Coset boundaries are in places marked by a few centimetres of mudstone or ripple-laminated siltstone. Mazumder and Van Kranendonk (2013) also recorded the presence of large-scale planar and tabular cross-stratification, associated with wind streaks and adhesion structures. Thorne and Seymour (1991) noted that paleocurrent data from the medium- to thick-bedded sandstones are either strongly unimodal and directed towards the west or west-southwest, or else are bipolar with a dominant south- and southeast-directed transport, and a minor component directed towards the northwest. Thin- to medium-bedded quartz sandstones typically consist of a lower assemblage of trough and tabular cross-stratified sandstone which passes upwards into an undulatory or ripple-laminated division. The latter is characterized by current-ripple or wave-ripple cross-lamination and bedforms. Paleocurrent trends in the cross-stratified beds are commonly bipolar, whereas those from the ripple laminated beds are highly variable.  Ferruginous conglomerate, sandstone, and pebbly sandstone are derived from the Hamersley Group and are composed predominantly of angular or subangular fragments of banded iron-formation and chert (mainly Weeli Wolli Formation), and lesser amounts of rounded rhyodacite and dolerite; the latter commonly exhibit a bleached outer rind. These rock types form a large-scale upward-fining unit that is preserved locally at the base (Three Corner Conglomerate Member) and near the top of the Beasley River Quartzite. Conglomerates can be divided into very thick-bedded conglomerate and inversely graded conglomerate. The former forms laterally continuous (>75 m) beds 4-17 m thick. Clast diameters are up to 0.45 m, but most are in the range 0.02 - 0.15 m.   The conglomerates are predominantly clast supported and rarely exhibit stratification, other than localized, bedding-parallel orientation of the tabular clasts. Many beds display a mixture of clast and matrix support, and bedding-parallel or random fabric. Locally, thicker conglomerate beds contain lenses of stratified, coarse-grained sandstone that have been slightly modified by soft-sediment deformation. Inversely graded, thick-bedded (3-4 m) conglomerate crops out in laterally continuous beds with sharp, non-erosive bases. Grain-size coarsens upwards, from a granule or, rarely, sandy conglomerate, to cobble conglomerate with an average maximum clast size of 0.1 m. Clast support is predominant in all but the sandy conglomerate horizons. Inversely graded conglomerate mostly exhibits a random fabric.   Ferruginous sandstones and pebbly sandstones are generally medium- to very coarse-grained and consist of multiple intersecting troughs, 0.05 - 0.20 m high and up to 1.5 m wide, which together form tabular cosets 0.3 - 1.5 m thick. Cosets are typically separated by a few centimetres of erosively based, parallel-laminated, medium- to coarse-grained sandstone. Ferruginous, medium- to coarse-grained sandstones and pebbly sandstones are commonly trough cross-stratified and locally grade upwards into ripple-laminated, fine-grained sandstone. Symmetrical ripples are preserved on the tops of some beds. Paleocurrent data from this facies are unidirectional at any stratigraphic level for a given locality and indicate that sediment transport took place towards the south and east near the southeastern closure of the Wyloo Dome.  Units of ferruginous sandstone and quartz sandstone are commonly separated by several metres of horizontally laminated, fine- to coarse-grained sandstone, composed of alternating light-coloured layers and dark ferruginous layers. The light-coloured component consists of angular, fine- to medium-grained quartz with lesser amounts of plagioclase and K-feldspar. Ferruginous layers consist of medium- to coarse-grained fragments of BIF, chert, hematite, and quartz. Many of these beds exhibit low-angle scours; locally, current lineations are observed. In addition, 1-3 cm thick layers of current- or wave-rippled, fine-grained quartz sandstone are interbedded within this unit.  Siltstones and mudstones are generally parallel laminated and intercalated with subordinate, thin-bedded, parallel- or ripple-laminated, fine-grained sandstone. North of the Wyloo Dome, these rocks include dolomitic mudstone and dolomite. The latter is generally thin bedded and parallel laminated and may be stromatolitic.","Thorne and Seymour (1991) interpreted the Beasley River Quartzite as a mixed association of alluvial fan, fluvial, tidal shoreline, and offshore deposits. During the early stages of deposition, thick, ferruginous, alluvial fan deposits were deposited in the area near the southeastern closure of the Wyloo Dome. Here, debris flows were deposited close to the fan apex, whereas braided-stream sediments characterized middle to outer parts of the fan. Longitudinal bars formed on more distal parts of the subaerial fan during periods of storm-induced sheet flooding; there was some reworking of these deposits by coastal processes locally. Farther east, between the Hardey and Turee Creek Synclines, the equivalent deposits were dominated by quartzitic tidal marine and fluvial sedimentation, although Mazumder and Van Kranendonk (2013) also recorded the presence of eolian sandstones in this part of the stratigraphy.  Following the initial phase of alluvial fan and fluvial progradation, rates of coastal plain subsidence exceeded those of deposition, resulting in the advance of deeper shoreline and offshore facies over the subaerial fan and fluvial plain. Near the Wyloo Dome, this period of coastal retreat was terminated abruptly by a second phase of source-area uplift, fan growth, and shoreline migration, which controlled facies distributions until the close of Beasley River Quartzite deposition.",,400,,"The Beasley River Quartzite unconformably overlies the Turee Creek Group, with the following exceptions: around Zone 50, MGA 644100E 7403100N on SNOWY MOUNT; Zone 50, MGA 742540E 7363000N on PRAIRIE DOWNS; south and northwest of the Paraburdoo iron ore mine on PARABURDOO and ASHBURTON; along the southern and northern margins of the Wyloo Dome on WYLOO and HARDEY. At these locations, it unconformably overlies the Hamersley Group. Its upper contact with the Cheela Springs Basalt is sharp and conformable.",,17,,,,4,,,,2208,,2208,,"The depositional age of the Beasley River Quartzite is close to c. 2208 Ma. This is based primarily on the age of dolerite sills that intrude both the formation and the unconformably underlying Turee Creek Group. It is also supported by age data from the overlying Cheela Springs Basalt. The U-Pb age of 2446 Â± 8 Ma, obtained from a zircon population in a sandstone sample from the lower part of the Beasley River Quartzite reference section (GSWA 169084; Nelson, 2004) is a maximum depositional age only and records the age of the Hamersley Group source rocks.  M&uuml;ller et al. (2005) obtained two separate U-Pb baddeleyite SHRIMP ages of 2208 Â± 10 Ma, one from a dolerite sill that intrudes the Beasley River Quartzite in the Turee Creek Syncline (Martin and Morris, 2010), and another from a sill that intrudes the Turee Creek Group and is truncated by the unconformity at the base of the Beasley River Quartzite in the Hardey Syncline. In addition, Martin et al. (1998) reported an age of 2209 Â± 15 Ma from a poorly bedded volcaniclastic breccia in the upper part of the Cheela Springs Basalt that overlies the Beasley River Quartzite. Although this age determination is strictly a maximum age, it was interpreted by these authors as being close to the true age of deposition. Taken together, these age determinations and field relationships point to a dynamic history of sedimentation, mafic magmatism, and deformation during the early stages of the 2215-2145 Ma Ophthalmia Orogeny (Rasmussen et al, 2005; Martin and Morris, 2010).",No,,,2,,No,Published,No,Yes,P_,SKq,,,,,MIGSDDM,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,No,No

350,26376,P_-SPb-stq,343,Bedford Sandstone,1,White to pale brown sandstone and conglomerate,"The Bedford Sandstone was defined by Griffin et al. (1993) much later than the other units of the Speewah Group. It is now a formal division and has been mapped as a distinct unit on the LISSADELL, LENNARD RIVER, and LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 map sheets. The formation was previously included in the overlying King Leopold Sandstone in the first edition of the DIXON RANGE and LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 map sheets (Dow and Gemuts, 1967; Gellatly et al., 1975, respectively) or included in the Lansdowne Arkose in the first edition of LENNARD RIVER (Derrick and Playford, 1973). It is probable that in areas where the Bedford Sandstone is not defined (i.e. on the CHARNLEY and YAMPI 1:250 000 map sheets) that the formation has been mapped as either the Lansdowne Arkose or King Leopold Sandstone (cf. Dow and Gemuts, 1967; Derrick and Playford, 1973; Gellatly et al., 1975). Ongoing fieldwork in the west Kimberley region will remap and refine the Speewah Group stratigraphy in these areas.  The Bedford Sandstone consists of white or pale-coloured siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. The volumetric majority of the formation is defined by coarse-grained quartz-rich sandstones including some quartz arenites. Feldspathic sandstones and fine-grained sedimentary lithofacies are a minor component of the formation. Cross-bedding is abundant with some large foresets 1-2 m thick (Griffin et al., 1993).","The Bedford Sandstone is a cliff-forming formation that outcrops within the Speewah Group on the northwest and northeast margins of the western zone of the Lamboo Province. The formation has been described on the LISSADELL, LANSDOWNE, and LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 map sheets.","The Bedford Sandstone was probably named after Mount Bedford in the Durack Ranges, approximately 26 km southwest on Bedford Downs Homestead (BEDFORD 1:100 000; LANSDOWNE 1:250 000).",,"The Bedford Sandstone has a lower unit of white, pink, or buff, medium- to coarse-grained, trough and tabular cross-bedded, quartz arenite (Thorne et al., 1999; Williams, 2005). Foresets 1-2 m thick are abundant. The formation contains polymictic pebbles on the LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 sheet with clasts of quartz, chert, and claystone (Griffin et al., 1993). This conglomeratic interval marks the transition to the upper unit on the LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 sheet, overlain by red, poorly sorted, medium- to very coarse-grained feldspathic sandstone with a sericitic-hematitic matrix (Williams, 2005). The upper sandstones are dominated by trough cross-stratification with foresets up to 1 m thick (Williams, 2005).  Paleoflow from trough cross-beds in the lower unit of the Bedford Sandstone indicate a flow from the north while trough cross-beds in the upper unit suggest a flow from the east-northeast (Williams, 2005).","The lower trough cross-bedded quartz arenites within the Bedford Sandstone were probably deposited in a shallow marine setting with strong bottom currents or a high current energy fluvial setting. The upper formation marks a retrogression to a fluvially-dominated setting, possibly a braided river system with trough cross-beds and tabular cross-beds punctuated by pebbly sandstone beds and conglomerates indicating higher current energy events.",200,500,,"The Bedford Sandstone is conformable with the underlying Luman Siltstone. A low angle unconformity has been described at the top of the Bedford Sandstone (between the Speewah and Kimberley Groups). The top of the Bedford Sandstone was termed the Bedford Surface by Williams (2005) who also described striations, frost fissures, and other glaciogenic lineations, associating the unconformity with a period of glaciation (King Leopold Glaciation). The Hart Dolerite intrudes Bedford Sandstone.",,17,,,,4,,,,1814,,1791,,"The Bedford Sandstone has not been directly dated, however, detrital zircon geochronology from the Tunganary Formation in the lower Speewah Group reported a maximum depositional age from a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1814 Â± 10 Ma from a population of seven young grains with the youngest detrital zircon dated at 1803 Â± 12 Ma (1&sigma;) (GS11031-2, Ramsay et al., 2017). The age of the youngest population at c. 1814 Ma is therefore considered a best estimate for the maximum age of the Speewah Group.  The Hart Dolerite extensively intrudes the Speewah Group (including the Bedford Sandstone) and lower Kimberley Group. Sills of Hart Dolerite and considered to be contiguous with basalt lava in the Carson Volcanics (Kimberley Group) and together constitute the Hart-Carson Large Igneous Province (Sheppard et al., 2012). Sheppard et al. (2012) reported U-Pb ages from a granophyric unit within the Hart Dolerite at 1799 Â± 17 Ma from zircon (GA 8759.8003) and 1795 Â± 15 Ma from baddeleyite (GSWA 113574). A minimum age of 1791 Â± 8 Ma was provided from sample GSWA 206156 by Wingate et al. (in prep).

4133,29989,A-HAdb-kd,2257,Bee Gorge Member,1,Turbiditic dolomitic shale interbedded with tuffs and banded iron formation; spherule marker bed,"The Bee Gorge Member is the uppermost and best exposed subdivision of the Wittenoom Formation, forming extensive exposures along the northern front of the Hamersley Range. It consists predominantly of graphitic and dolomitic argillite, but also contains three distinctive marker beds: the Crystal rich tuff, Main tuff interval, and the Spherule marker bed. The Bee Gorge Member has a maximum thickness of about 227 m near Wittenoom town site, and thins towards the south and southwest. The Bee Gorge Member is interpreted to be primarily the product of hemipelagic deposition in a deep-water environment, most likely distal to a carbonate shelf or platform to the northeast. The tuff and spherule marker beds are interpreted to be the resedimented products of major hydrovolcanic eruptions and a major submarine bolide impact, respectively. These marker beds have been directly dated and, along with constraints from overlying and underlying units, constrain the depositional age of the Bee Gorge Member to c. 2570 to 2506 Ma.","The Bee Gorge Member is present throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region on the 1:250 000 map sheets YARRALOOLA, PYRAMID, WYLOO, MOUNT BRUCE, ROY HILL, BALFOUR DOWNS, TUREE CREEK, NEWMAN, and ROBERTSON where it is generally exposed in the lower slopes of ranges composed of the Brockman Iron Formation. It is thickest in the vicinity of the type section where it measures 227 m, and appears to thin southward towards Tom Price (Zone 50, MGA 578178E 7485746N) where it is 111 m thick.","The type area and section of the Bee Gorge Member are in the vicinity of the type area of the parent Wittenoom Formation near the town of Wittenoom. The type section (Simonson et al., 1993a) is in discontinuous exposures along the eastern slope of the mouth of Bee Gorge (Zone 50, MGA 629758E 7541879N) that can be correlated using resistant marker beds. Three of these marker beds have been named as informal units. They are the Crystal rich tuff, Main tuff interval, and the Spherule marker bed. Further good exposures of the Bee Gorge Member can be found at Mount Pyrton (Zone 50, MGA 534310E 7581110N), Hamersley Gorge (Zone 50, MGA 603433E 7542657N), Wittenoom Gorge (Zone 50, MGA 636701E 7534542N), Mount Lockyer (Zone 50, MGA 682128E 7515185N), and Conical Hill (Zone 50, MGA 611999E 7502885N). Incomplete sections through the lower part of the Bee Gorge Member are present in the Millstream 10 and 11 drillholes that are stored at the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) Carlisle Core Library.",,"The Bee Gorge Member consists mainly of planar-laminated, fissile shale and dolomitic shale that is commonly graphitic in core. Subordinate lithologies include carbonate, chert, tuffaceous volcaniclastic rocks, impact spherule beds, and iron formation. The thickest carbonate bed does not exceed 4.2 m and iron formation beds are even thinner. However, the volcaniclastic rocks are locally up to 16.4 m thick (Simonson et al., 1993). Carbonate beds are usually characterized by clastic textures, indicating derivation from a carbonate shelf or platform, most likely to the northeast. Kargel et al. (1996) describe mudcracks from the Bee Gorge Member in the vicinity of the type section, but similar shallow-water to emergent features have not been noted anywhere else in the member. The Crystal rich tuff rarely exceeds 10 cm in thickness and is composed of thin, graded beds of volcaniclastic detritus that is rich in crystal debris. The Main tuff interval (MTI) is a distinctive unit of pyroclastic turbidites that ranges in thickness from 4.2 to 16.4 m (Simonson et al., 1993a; Hassler, 1991), but may be up to 19 m thick (Kepert, 2018). The Spherule marker bed (SMB) is generally about 20 m above the MTI and consists of a thin layer of mixed impact melt spherules (microkrystites) and carbonate detritus that have been resedimented by sediment gravity flows (Simonson, 1992; Simonson et al., 1993b; Simonson and Hassler, 1997; Scally and Simonson, 2005). The thickness of the SMB is variable, but in the order of centimetres and occasionally up to 1 m thick (Simonson et al., 1993a).","The Bee Gorge Member is interpreted to be primarily the result of hemipelagic deposition in a deep-water environment, most likely distal to a carbonate shelf or platform to the northeast. This interpretation is supported by the absence of any evidence for deposition above storm wave base and the predominantly argillaceous lithology. However, locally emergent conditions may have been present in the most proximal areas to the northeast (Kargel et al., 1996). The three recognized marker horizons all show evidence for deposition from sediment gravity flows. It includes incomplete Bouma cycles that reworked primary volcaniclastic and carbonate sands and impact melt spherules, reflecting a lithologically more diverse source area to the northeast. Specifically the Main tuff interval is interpreted to be the indirect product of a major hydrovolcanic eruption (Hassler, 1993), whilst the Spherule marker bed records the resedimentation of silicate melt droplets produced by a major submarine bolide impact (Simonson, 1992; Simonson and Hassler, 1997; Scally and Simonson, 2005).",,227,,"The basal contact of the Bee Gorge Member is placed at the transition from dolomite beds with thin argillite partings of the underlying Paraburdoo Member to predominantly argillite, with or without other lithologies (Simonson et al., 1993a).

791,1491,P_-BE-xs-f,1,Bentley Supergroup,1,"Rhyolitic and basaltic volcanic rocks, conglomerate and sandstone, and minor carbonate rock","The Bentley Supergroup was initially proposed by Daniels (1974) to include the weakly to moderately deformed and metamorphosed bimodal volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, and fine- to coarse-grained sedimentary rocks including chert, siliciclastic rocks, and stromatolite-bearing carbonate rocks, that unconformably overlie the high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Musgrave Province. These rocks are the same age as many of the gabbros and granites that intruded the Musgrave Province during the c. 1085 to 1030 Ma Giles Event. These intrusive igneous rocks and the related extrusive igneous rocks of the Bentley Supergroup, are part of the Warakurna Supersuite (Wingate et al., 2004).  Daniels (1974) divided the Bentley Supergroup into four main lithostratigraphic units: the Pussy Cat, Tollu, Cassidy, and Mission Groups. Outcrop of the Tollu Group is almost entirely restricted to an east-trending synclinal structure (Blackstone syncline) located south of Blackstone Community (the Blackstone Sub-basin). The other groups are restricted to the area extending north of Barrow Range and as far west as the Warburton area. This region also included what Daniels (1974) referred to as the Scamp and Palgrave volcanic associations. These units, which are also part of the Bentley Supergroup and of the Talbot Sub-basin, were re-assigned to the newly defined Mount Palgrave and Kaarnka Groups by Howard et al. (2011). The supergroup almost certainly extends to the north in both Western Australia and the Northern Territory, as the Tjauwata Group, and may be present beneath the Officer Basin to the west.","The Bentley Supergroup unconformably overlies high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Musgrave Province, mainly in the Mamutjarra Zone. Outcrop of the Tollu Group is almost entirely restricted to the east-trending, synclinal Blackstone Sub-Basin, south of BLACKSTONE, whereas the other groups are restricted to the region extending east from Warburton to the Barrow Range (approximately 40 km southwest of Jameson Community), in what is referred to as the Talbot Sub-Basin. Small outliers are also found immediately south of the Blackstone Range (the Blackstone Sub-Basin on BLACKSTONE, south of Blackstone Community), around Skirmish Hill (southeast corner of BLACKSTONE), and south of the Bell Rock Range (on BELL ROCK). To the south of the Blackstone syncline, units of pebble sandstone and conglomerate (MacDougall Formation), and amygdaloidal basalt and andesite (Mummawarrawarra Basalt) were originally viewed as the basal portion of the Tollu Group (Daniels, 1974), but were subsequently found to constitute a separate unit unconformable beneath the Tollu Group (the Kunmarnara Group, Smithies et al., 2009).   The Tollu Group most likely extends eastwards under cover onto the western edge of BLACKSTONE. Mapping on COOPER also suggests that the Tollu and Kunmarnara Groups may extend under cover to the west-southwest, possibly providing a direct link with more extensive Bentley Supergroup units (the Mount Palgrave, Kaarnka, Pussy Cat, Cassidy, and Mission Groups) exposed within the Talbot Sub-Basin in the Mount Palgrave - Barrow Range region (MOUNT EVELINE). The Tollu Group may also be exposed adjacent to, and to the north of, the Hinckley intrusion (FINLAYSON), and within the Tjuni Purlka Zone in the north of HOLT and the south of GUNBARREL.  A lithologically similar sequence of volcanic, volcaniclastic, and clastic rocks lies to the north of this region, within the footwall of the Woodroffe Thrust (between the Petermann and Bloods Ranges in both Western Australia and the Northern Territory). Close et al. (2003) redefined these rocks as the Tjauwata Group by combining and replacing the Bloods Range Beds and the Mount Harris Volcanics. They are unconformably overlain by the Neoproterozoic Amadeus Basin. Recent geochronological data (1085-1040 Ma; Edgoose et al., 2004) show that this group can be directly correlated with the Bentley Supergroup. To the south of the Musgrave Province, a drillhole (GSWA Empress 1) intersected basalt beneath the basal sedimentary rock unit of the Officer Basin, which gave a K-Ar age of 1058 Â± 13 Ma (Stevens and Apak, 1999). This occurrence suggests that the Bentley Supergroup extends south beneath this Neoproterozoic basin.","The Bentley Supergroup was initially proposed by Daniels (1974) to include weakly to moderately deformed and metamorphosed bimodal volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, and fine- to coarse-grained sedimentary rocks, which unconformably overlie the high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Musgrave Province. Bentley Hill is located in the south-central part of the BENTLEY 1:250 000 map sheet.",,"Daniels (1974) divided the Bentley Supergroup into four main lithostratigraphic units: the Pussy Cat, Tollu, Cassidy, and Mission Groups. Outcrop of the Tollu Group is almost entirely restricted to an east-trending, synclinal structure (Blackstone syncline and the Blackstone Sub-Basin) south of BLACKSTONE, whereas the other groups are restricted to the region between Warburton to the west and the Barrow Range to the east, in what is referred to as the Talbot Sub-Basin. In addition, Daniels (1974) recognized three regions dominated by felsic volcanic rocks, but also intruded by subvolcanic granite, called the Scamp, Palgrave, and Skirmish Hill volcanic associations (Daniels, 1974). Each of these regions was thought to outline a fault-bounded caldera. Subsequent mapping redefined the Palgrave volcanic association as the Mount Palgrave Group, which underlies the Pussy Cat Group (Howard et al., 2011). Since then, the Mount Palgrave Group has been split. The upper part now forms the Kaarnka Group, comprising fine- to coarse-grained felsic volcaniclastic rocks, rhyolitic (and rarer dacitic) lavas, pyroclastic falls, pyroclastic flows, and subvolcanic intrusions, and rare basalt flows. The lower part has been combined with rocks formerly assigned to the Scamp volcanic association, forming the redefined Mount Palgrave Group. This group mainly comprises vitric rhyolitic lavas, pyroclastic falls and flows, and rare basalt lavas, and forms the oldest component of the Bentley Supergroup in the Talbot Sub-Basin. Current interpretations suggest that the outcrop extent of the Kaarnka Group defines a basin structure that might represent a volcanic caldera. Although outcrop of the Kaarnka Group is largely surrounded by outcrop of the Mount Palgrave Group, the two units are locally separated by outcrop of the Pussy Cat Group, so this caldera was possibly formed during the early depositional stage of the Pussy Cat Group.  Daniels (1974) suggested that the Tollu and Pussy Cat Groups are lateral equivalents. The Pussy Cat Group includes the lower dacitic to rhyolitic Kathleen Ignimbrite, which is intercalated with, and overlain by, the basalts and felsic to mafic volcaniclastic rocks of the Glyde Formation. However, geochemical data subsequently obtained by GSWA do not support a correlation between the Tollu and Pussy Cat Groups.  The Cassidy Group is a bimodal volcanic sequence comprising (listed from base upwards): the Wururu Rhyolite, Gombugurra Rhyolite (including minor volcanosedimentary rocks and basalt), Gurgadi Basalt, Thomas Rhyolite, Warubuyu Basalt, Hilda Rhyolite, and Miller Basalt (Daniels, 1974).  The overlying Mission Group is a more diverse sequence, including a significant proportion of volcaniclastic and clastic rocks (Daniels, 1974). From the base upwards, this unit consists of: the Gamminah Conglomerate, Frank Scott Formation (stromatolitic dolomite, siltstone, chert, and sandstone), Lilian Formation (shale, basalt, chert, conglomerate, and rare dolomite), and Milesia Formation (basalt and fine- to coarse-grained siliciclastic sedimentary rocks).  The Tollu Group has been subdivided subsequent to its original definition by Daniels (1974). To the south of the Blackstone syncline, units of pebble sandstone and conglomerate (MacDougall Formation), and amygdaloidal basalt and andesite (Mummawarrawarra Basalt), originally viewed as the basal portion of the Tollu Group (Daniels, 1974), were subsequently found to form a separate group (the Kunmarnara Group) unconformable beneath the Tollu Group and forming the oldest component of the Bentley Supergroup (Smithies et al., 2009). The redefined Tollu Group now consists of the basal Smoke Hill Volcanics and overlying Hogarth Formation (Daniels, 1974; Smithies et al., 2009). The Smoke Hill Volcanics is dominated by porphyritic rhyolite and dacite, occurring as lavas, sills, and cryptodomes.  Volcaniclastic deposits are locally common, and include breccia-sandstone and laminated sandstones to siltstones. Some volcaniclastic units are interpreted as rheoignimbrites. Intrusive and extrusive rocks are locally flow-banded, amygdaloidal, or spherulitic. Lavas also show hyaloclastite breccias, indicating subaqueous deposition. The overlying Hogarth Formation comprises andesitic to trachytic lava flows. The dominant unit is a variolitic, andesitic to trachytic lava, but acicular- and comb-textured andesitic to trachytic lavas also occur. Volcaniclastic rocks, including pebble breccias, laminated volcanic siltstones, and subordinate sandstones, are interbedded with the lavas near the base of the formation, and porphyritic aphanitic rhyolite and lesser dacite lavas commonly occur at the top of the formation. ",,,10000,,"Contacts between rocks of the Bentley Supergroup and those of the underlying Musgrave Province are either unconformable or faulted. In the area between Jameson and Warburton, Daniels (1974) suggested that the contacts between the Pussy Cat Group and the (former) Scamp volcanic association (now part of the Mount Palgrave Group), and between these units and the (former) Palgrave volcanic association (now split between the Mount Palgrave Group and the overlying Kaarnka Group), were major faults, defining the boundaries of separate calderas. However, more recent mapping suggests that all of these rocks most likely comprise a single stratigraphic pile, with the Pussy Cat Group conformably overlying rocks of the (former) Scamp volcanic association, which is combined with rocks of the Palgrave volcanic association to form the Mount Palgrave Group.  Rocks of the redefined Tollu Group directly overlie layered, mafic intrusive rocks from the earliest magmatic phase of the Giles Suite (P_-WKG). The mafic intrusive rocks of the Giles Suite intrude rocks of the Kunmarnara Group, and basalt inclusions can be seen in the basalt units of many of the layered and non-layered Giles intrusions. Where the volcanic rocks at the base of the Tollu Group (Smoke Hill Volcanics) directly overlie the layered, mafic Blackstone intrusion (P_-WKG-o), the depositional layering in the volcanic rocks parallels igneous layering in the intrusion. There is no evidence for a faulted contact between the intrusion and the volcanic rocks. In addition, dykes that are geochemically identical to lavas in the Hogarth Formation cut the layering in the mafic Cavenagh intrusion (P_-WKG-o) to the south. These relationships indicate a significant time gap between deposition of the Kunmarnara Group (which pre-dates, and was intruded by, layered mafic intrusions of the Giles Suite) and eruption of the Smoke Hill Volcanics. During that time gap, the layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions were emplaced within the Mummawarrawarra Basalt of the Kunmarnara Group, and the whole package was uplifted, eroded, and possibly folded. The rocks of the Tollu Group also unconformably overlie rocks of the Musgrave Province s Mamutjarra Zone.",,17,,,Mixed,1,,,,1085,,1026,26,"Rocks of the Bentley Supergroup were dated as 1060 Â± 140 Ma (based on a Rb-Sr isochron; Compston and Nesbitt, 1967) and, more recently, as 1078 Â± 5 Ma (SHRIMP U-Pb zircon) by Sun et al. (1996), confirming suggestions made by Daniels (1974) that these rocks are broadly the same age as the mafic-ultramafic Giles Suite intrusions (P_-WKG) and West Hinckley Suite (P_-WKH). Recent geochronological data obtained from the Tjauwata Group in the southwest of the Northern Territory (1090-1040 Ma; Edgoose et al., 2004) show that this unit can be directly correlated with the Bentley Supergroup, and specifically with the Tollu Group (Close et al., 2003).  Layered, mafic intrusive rocks of the Giles Suite (P_-WKG) were emplaced within the Mummawarrawarra Basalt of the Kunmarnara Group, and at the base of the Bentley Supergroup. A sample obtained from these layered rocks yielded a magmatic crystallization age of 1076 Â± 7 Ma (GSWA 194762, Kirkland et al., 2011); Sun et al. (1996) obtained an age of 1078 Â± 3 Ma from a granitic layer within the layered Bell Rock intrusion. Hence, an age range of 1078-1075 Ma can be inferred for these layered intrusions, which can also be interpreted as a minimum age of deposition for the basalt unit (Smithies et al., 2009). The maximum age of deposition is constrained by the youngest detrital zircon age component (1172 Â± 8 Ma, Evins et al., 2010) from rocks of the MacDougall Formation, which forms the base of the Kunmarnara Group.  Age constraints on the Tollu Group have previously hinged on a 1078 Â± 5 Ma date obtained by Glikson et al. (1996) from an outcrop identified as rhyolite (Smoke Hill Volcanics). Re-examination of that outcrop (Smithies et al., 2009) indicated that the rock is, in fact, a fine- to medium-grained leucogranite, petrographically and texturally identical to c. 1075 Ma leucogranites of the Warakurna Supersuite (P_-WK-g), and therefore not part of the Tollu Group.  A vitric dacite, sampled south of the Blackstone Range and north of Smoke Hill, gave an age of 1026 Â± 26 Ma (GSWA 187177, Kirkland et al., 2010), which was interpreted as the igneous crystallization age of the upper part of the Smoke Hill Volcanics (Smithies et al., 2009). However, two rhyolite samples recently collected from around Mount Jane in the east of the Blackstone syncline, have given ages of 1071 Â± 8 Ma (GSWA 191728, Coleman et al., 2010a) and 1073 Â± 7 Ma (GSWA 191706, Coleman et al., 2010b). These ages are consistent with the observation that a series of olivine gabbros, olivine norites, ferronorites, and ferrodiorites (Alcurra Dolerite, P_-WKal; previously P_-WKg3), which intruded the Smoke Hill Volcanics in the western part of the Blackstone syncline, are part of a geochemically homogeneous suite dated at c. 1067 Ma (Seat, 2008; Howard et al., 2009). It is most likely that the 1026 Â± 26 Ma dacite dated by Kirkland et al. (2010) represents a subvolcanic sill younger than the Smoke Hill Volcanics (either belonging to the Hogarth Formation, or younger units); this date now provides a minimum crystallization age for the Tollu Group.",No,,,71,,No,Submitted,Yes,No,P_,BE,,16,6,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,No,No

This unit yielded numerous zircons of various ages, with the youngest detrital zircon in the sample yielding a  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1758 Â± 18 Ma, therefore providing a maximum age of deposition for the Biddenew Formation. Additional information is provided by SHRIMP U-Pb analyses of detrital zircons from six samples of the overlying Spring Camp Formation (P_-POs-mtqs).

The Suite includes two large, north-trending batholiths, exposed on either flank of the northeast-trending Meekatharra-Wydgee Greenstone Belt, western Yilgarn Craton. Granitic rocks of the Big Bell Suite were emplaced between c. 2735 and 2690 Ma. The suite includes migmatitic rafts ranging in composition from granite to amphibolite. Geochemically, the Big Bell Suite shows a dominant Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite (TTG) affinity. Most granitic rocks show a well-developed, generally north- to northeast-trending magmatic foliation. A mid- to upper amphibolite facies tectonic foliation commonly occurs along pluton margins, at the contact with host greenstones.","Granites and metagranites of the Big Bell Suite have been mapped throughout the western part of the Youanmi Terrane in the western Yilgarn Craton, from BADJA and NINGHAN in the southwest, to MEEKATHARRA and TIERACO in the northeast. The Suite includes two large, north-trending batholiths, exposed on either flank of the northeast-trending Meekatharra-Wydgee Greenstone Belt. The western large pluton (Lakeside pluton, Zibra et al., 2014) is a north-trending elongate pluton that is about 150 km long by 50 km across strike. exposed between Thundelarra Homestead (Zone 50, MGA 512933E 6803927N) to Coodardy Homestead (Zone 50, MGA 564688E 6985205N). The eastern large batholith (Yarraquin pluton, Zibra et al., 2017), a north-trending elongate pluton that is about 100 km long by 50 km across strike, extends from Challa Homestead (Zone 50, MGA 628512E 6871004N) to Wanmulla Homestead (Zone 50, MGA 632613E 685900N).","This suite is named after the Big Bell gold mine, located near Coodardy Homestead, on CUE.

Granitic rocks of the Big Bell Suite were emplaced between c. 2735 and 2690 Ma (Van Kranendonk et al., 2013). In places the suite includes migmatitic rafts that range in size from a few centimetres to a few hundreds of metres. These rafts represent remnants of older tonalite to granite gneiss that were carried upwards by the younger magma. Domains characterized by abundant migmatitic rafts have been mapped as A-SDB-jmg-mgti. Amphibolite rafts occur locally, and are generally more abundant near contacts with host greenstone belts, probably representing roof pendants from the country rocks, incorporated by the magma during pluton emplacement. Strain is variably distributed throughout the suite, but shows some common traits. Most granitic rocks show a well-developed, generally north- to northeast-trending magmatic foliation, i.e. subparallel to the map-scale granite-greenstone system. Tectonic foliation commonly occurs along pluton margins, at the contact with host greenstones. Here, high-strain domains typically contain granite gneiss and mylonitic gneiss. Microstructures indicate that the solid-state foliation generally developed at mid- to upper amphibolite facies conditions (e.g. Zibra et al., 2014). Geochemically, the Big Bell Suite shows a dominant Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite (TTG) affinity, and locally contains late-plutonic low-Ca leucogranites that likely derive from anatexis of the upper felsic crust during pluton emplacement (Zibra et al., 2014).",,,,,"Granite and metagranites of the Big Bell Suite discordantly intrude mafic to felsic, igneous and metasedimentary rocks of the Norie (A-NO-xmb-f), Polelle (A-PO-xb-f) and Glen Groups (A-GL-xb-s). Rocks from the Big Bell Suite are also intrusive into metagranitic and gabboic rocks of the Annean Supersuite (A-AN-xmg-o).

3057,79288,D-_bi-st,1,Bindoo Sandstone,1,"Fine- to medium-grained silty sandstone, locally coarse-grained and pebbly, siltstone and claystone","The Bindoo Sandstone is named for the sandstone-dominated unit exposed in the immediate vicinity of Bindoo Hill, extending north past the Greenough River. It consists of fine- to medium-grained quartzose sandstone, locally coarse and with pebbles in pockets and stringers along coset bases, interbedded on a scale of tens of metres with siltstone. Metre-scale contorted bedding affects cross-bedded units. The facies and lithology exposed suggest that it is not Tumblagooda Sandstone in that it is not a red-bed succession, and facies include mixed silty and sandy fluvial deposits. Paleocurrents flowed northwestwards, in common with most other Paleozoic fluvial-dominated sandstones along Western Australia's western margin. The only known bioturbation is stellate mining burrows in a separate outcrop just northwest of the type area - this may be a separate fault block that is not Bindoo Sandstone and may be a different age, although still pre-Permian.  There are no internal age constraints, although dating of detrital zircons is in progress (in mid-2017). A Middle Devonian age is inferred by comparison with successions in other basins, in particular the Nannyarra Sandstone of the Southern Carnarvon Basin, from the degree of faulting compared to Mesozoic units in the Greenough valley, and from apparent outcrop relationships with the Nangetty Formation (mostly early Permian).","The Bindoo Sandstone has been recognised in the natural amphitheatre and breakaways north of Bindoo Hill, and tentatively recognised in other scattered sandstone outcrops east of the Northampton Inlier that do not look like Tumblagooda Sandstone either in predictable facies trends (towards coarse-grained proximal facies) or the sedimentary structures and nature of the sandstone (not red-bed, and with foreshore or mixed silty and sandy fluvial facies). These were shown as ?Devonian by Hocking (1991, Fig. 5). They were mapped as Silurian Tumblagooda Sandstone on Geraldton 1:250 000 sheet (Playford et al., 1970).  Estimates of thickness are approximate only. Probably 200 to 300 m stratigraphic thickness is present in the Bindoo Hill area, in multiple fault blocks.  It may be present in Wendy 1, but this has not been verified by close examination of the core or by detrital zircon signatures.","The Bindoo Sandstone is named after Bindoo Hill, 26 km west of Mullewa. A specific type section has not been selected, but the type area is designated as the breakaways and Nature Reserve directly south of Noodamurra Pool on the Greenough River, at about MGA Zone 50 326500E 6850500N. A slightly different facies with uncommon bioturbation in the form of stellate mining burrows is present on the southern river bank around 326300E 5861520N, west of the Nature Reserve, but this is probably in a separate fault block and may be a different stratigraphic unit.",,"In the type area, the Bindoo Sandstone consists of fine- to medium-grained quartzose sandstone, locally coarse and with pebbles in pockets and stringers along coset bases, interbedded on a scale of tens of metres with white-weathering siltstone. Metre-scale contorted bedding affects cross-bedded units. Swash cross-bedding, with moderate angle tabular eastward-directed cross-bedding and westwards low angle tabular to irregular cross-bedding, is present near Nolba quarry. It is pale buff-coloured to white-weathering in general. The only known bioturbation is stellate mining burrows in a separate outcrop just northwest of the type area - this may be a separate fault block and not Bindoo Sandstone. Paleocurrents flowed northwestwards, in common with most other Paleozoic fluvial-dominated sandstones along Western Australia's western margin.  By colouration, the Bindoo Sandstone is not a red-bed succession, unlike the Lower Devonian, Silurian and Ordovician successions of Western and central Australia, particularly the Tumblagooda Sandstone. The facies present are suggestive of channelized fluvial and overbank deposition, with some beach or foreshore deposition, rather than sheet-braided fluvial and tidal sandflat. The facies are also different to predictable facies trends for the Tumblagooda Sandstone - fine and medium grained rather than coarse grained to conglomeratic, seen in other outcrops east o the Northampton Inlier and inferred to be Tumblagooda Sandstone. It is thus interpreted as postdating them. It lacks any indication of glacial conditions during deposition, and appears to underlie the Nangetty Formation.","The Bindoo Sandstone is interpreted as fluvial channel and overbank floodplain deposits between Bindoo Hill and the Greenough River, based on the large-scale intercalated sandstone and siltstone exposed there. Similar cross-bedded sandstone with stellate bioturbation exposed just to the northwest may indicate a coastally located deposition site, continental bioturbation, or be a different unit. Foreshore deposits with swash cross-bedding, suggestive of a beach setting, are preserved in exposures near the Nolba quarry interpreted here as Bindoo Sandstone, following Hocking (1991)'s exclusion of them from the Tumblagooda Sandstone and ?Devonian age interpretation.",,300,,"The Bindoo Sandstone is exposed in discontinuous outcrops from which few contact relationships can be inferred. It appears to underlie Nangetty Formation. North of Bindoo Hill, a major fault zone associated with the Urella Fault cuts the outcrop belt, further complicating identification and interpretation, as on some imagery an angular unconformity appears to be present within the interpreted extent of the sandstone. An interpretation of slightly differently oriented fault blocks is preferred here, based on stereoscopic air photo examination. ",,17,,,,4,,,,393.3,,358.9,,"There are no firm constraints on the age of the Bindoo Sandstone.

It could be a correlative of the Nannyarra Sandstone (largely Givetian) or the Munabia Sandstone (Famennian) of the eastern Merlinleigh Sub-basin of the Southern Carnarvon Basin, based solely on lithological similarity, but there is a wide geographic separation.

The formation consists of up 700 m of upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies mafic volcanic, sedimentary, and volcaniclastic rocks. The formation unconformably overlies the underlying Brim Rockhole Formation (P_-HCb-xmkt-mv) and disconformably or locally unconformably overlain by deep-marine sedimentation in the Olympio Formation. The Biscay Formation was deposited in a broadly shallow-marine setting with mafic volcanic material derived from a series of submarine or subaerial volcanic centres. The age of the formation is constrained by a c. 1881 Ma felsic metavolcanic rock in the underlying Brim Rockhole Formation, and a sample from near the top of the Biscay Formation, which has a maximum depositional age of c. 1861 Ma.","The Biscay Formation is well exposed in a >165 km long belt in the Eastern Zone of the Lamboo Province. To the south, the formation is exposed in low hills and plains, which are developed on several anticlinal structures from Mount Carmel (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 293126E 7910693N) to Syenite Camp (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 308113E 7935186N). The dominant exposures of the Biscay Formation are located in two areas on either side of the Halls Creek Fault (Blake et al., 1999). In the southern area, the Biscay Formation is exposed west of the Halls Creek Fault around Ruby Plains Homestead (RUBY PLAINS, Zone 52, MGA 356622E 7943485N) and along the Tanami Road. In this area, the formation has a roughly wedge-shaped exposure. The northerly extent of the formation is exposed in a rugged terrain of steep hills and strike ridges east of the Halls Creek Fault from Old Halls Creek (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 371095E 7981880N) to Alice Downs Homestead (MCINTOSH, Zone 52, MGA 387553E 8036392N).","The Biscay Formation was named by Smith (1963) after the Bay of Biscay Hills between the Panton River and Grant Peak (DIXON, Zone 52, MGA 395124E 8032217N), southeast of Alice Downs Homestead (MCINTOSH, Zone 52, MGA 387553E 8036392N). The Biscay Formation originally described all rocks overlying the fine-grained to coarse-grained clastic sandstones and conglomerates of the Saunders Creek Formation (P_-HCs-xmt-mx) and underlying the turbiditic metasedimentary rocks in the Olympio Formation (P_-HCo-xmt-ml). Siliciclastic and carbonate metasedimentary rocks at the base of the Biscay Formation were raised to formation status by Phillips et al. (2016), based on differences in sedimentology and U-Pb SHRIMP provenance data. These rocks are now assigned to the Brim Rockhole Formation (P_-HCb-xmkt-mv). The Biscay Formation was redefined to include all metasedimentary and mafic metavolcanic rocks above a low-angle unconformity at the top of the Brim Rockhole Formation and below the disconformable to unconformable surface that defines the base of the Olympio Formation (Phillips et al., 2016).",,"The Biscay Formation is deformed into elongate northeast-trending folds, many of which are doubly plunging. The Biscay Formation is dominated by greenschist facies to lower amphibolite facies metasedimentary and mafic metavolcanic units. The metasedimentary lithofacies consist of mafic schists, fine-grained mafic-derived metasandstone, quartz-rich metasandstone, and less common schistose psammite, which probably had sublitharenite or litharenite protoliths. Siltstone and mudstone beds have been variably metamorphosed to metasiltstone or metamudstone, pelitic schists, phyllites, and slate. Subordinate lithologies include felsic schists, carbonaceous rocks, and metachert. Metasandstone beds and schistose rocks comprise very fine-grained to fine-grained, quartz-rich and mafic-derived biotite-bearing metasandstone and metasiltstone. They are commonly well sorted, massive, and siliceous with faint planar laminations and cross-laminations composed of silt-grade aluminous and iron-rich material. Metasiltstone clasts <1 mm wide are common. Ferromagnesian minerals, such as pyroxenes, biotite, and magnetite are altered to actinolite and chlorite (Phillips et al., 2016). Volcaniclastic rocks are black, thick-bedded, very well sorted, and friable with areas that appear pumiceous. Pseudomorphs of feldspar and possible pyrite are found associated with black, graphitic shale-type thin laminations.  Biscay Formation volcanic units are lower amphibolite facies metabasalt, amphibolite, and metadolerite. The abundance of metabasalt increases towards the top of the Biscay Formation. Ridges of basalt 250-500 m thick are present near Ruby Plains Homestead (RUBY PLAINS, Zone 52, MGA 356622E 7943485N). Feldspar laths are pseudomorphed by non-twinned (albite)-carbonate-quartz and minor epidote. All ferromagnesian minerals are replaced by amphibole, including green actinolite and yellow to colourless tremolite. Chlorite and chlorite carbonate with minor epidote also replace ferromagnesian minerals (Phillips et al., 2016). In most samples, no original igneous textures are preserved. Amphibole crystals form sweeping bundles and in many samples amphibole crystals define a foliation with intervening feldspar-quartz-carbonate and opaque oxide minerals. Titanite forms small, poorly defined granular crystals associated with opaque minerals (mainly hematite with rare pyrite). Many of these grains are partially altered to hydrated iron oxides. In some outcrops, feldspar crystals are aligned, suggesting the unit may be flow-banded. Quartz-filled amygdales are present in the upper portions of metabasalt flows (Phillips et al., 2016). ","The low-angle unconformity between the Brim Rockhole Formation (P_-HCb-xmkt-mv) and Biscay Formation probably represents a depositional hiatus and basin-wide transgression drowning locally current restricted depositional settings. Detrital zircon geochronology from the Brim Rockhole Formation (GSWA 206121, Wingate et al., 2015) yielded a significant age component of c. 1909 Ma, which is consistent with derivation from the underlying 1912-1904 Ma (Blake et al., 1999; Phillips et al., 2016). Biscay Formation metasandstone units do not yield any age components consistent with derivation from the 1912-1904 Ma Sophie Downs Suite.. These data suggest that local basement highs, present during the deposition of the Saunders Creek Formation and Brim Rockhole Formation, were buried during the deposition of the Biscay Formation (Phillips et al., 2016). Immature and lithic metasandstone with clasts of metasiltstone and metasandstone indicate sourcing from a proximate continental province with grains of pyroxene, actinolite, biotite, chlorite, and magnetite (some are now hematite), indicative of partial derivation from the concomitant mafic volcanism. Biscay Formation metasedimentary units have either a planar geometry or gently pinch and swell along-strike with uncommon erosive contacts. These features suggest deposition in an unrestricted shallow-marine setting, probably tidally influenced. Higher current energy episodes produced erosive contacts and rare coarse-grained beds, possibly tempestite facies. Intercalated metabasalt is massive to amygdaloidal, locally flow-banded, and was probably emplaced in submarine and subaerial settings. Uncommon pillow lavas suggest some of the volcanism was submarine. Metavolcanic rocks in the Biscay Formation represent mafic volcanism associated with extension and basin subsidence on the western margin of the North Australian Craton. These data are consistent with a prolonged magmatic event, which continued from the Brim Rockhole Formation at c. 1881 Ma to the end of the Biscay Formation at c. 1861 Ma.",,700,,"The Biscay Formation is unconformable on the Brim Rockhole Formation on the eastern flank of the Sophie Downs Dome, 5-7 km northeast of the Sophie Downs Homestead (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 374524E 7988000N). The Biscay Formation is disconformably, and locally unconformably, overlain by the Olympio Formation. This disconformity probably represents basin-wide subsidence and marine transgression drowning shallow-marine lithofacies under deep-marine turbidite sedimentation and volcanism. In some places, the contact between the Biscay and Olympio Formations is faulted. The north-northeasterly trending Halls Creek Fault places the Biscay Formation against turbidite metasandstone units in the Olympio Formation on southern HALLS CREEK and northern RUBY PLAINS (Blake et al., 1999). Similar north-northeasterly trending faults on southeast MCINTOSH also place upfaulted Biscay Formation against the Olympio Formation (Tyler et al., 1996).  The Biscay Formation is faulted against the Tickalara Metamorphics (Central Zone) along the Halls Creek Fault in the Duffer Range east of the Great Northern Highway (MCINTOSH, Zone 52, MGA 375994E 8003004N). In the Duffer Range area, the Halls Creek Fault also juxtaposes the Biscay Formation against younger Paleoproterozoic sedimentary rocks, including the c. 1795 Ma King Leopold Sandstone and Carson Volcanics (Kimberley Basin) and the Red Rock Formation, which is a probable Kimberley Basin age equivalent.  The Biscay Formation is intruded by the c. 1835 Ma Woodward Dolerite at all stratigraphic levels. In the Mount Dockrell (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 313881E 7921738N) and Syenite Camp (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 308113E 7935186N) areas, the Biscay Formation is intruded by the c. 1808 Ma Mount Christine Granite of the Sally Downs Supersuite (Tyler et al., 1998; Page et al., 2001).",,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,1881,,1861,,"A sample of felsic metavolcanic rock from the Brim Rockhole Formation, which unconformably underlies the Biscay Formation, yielded a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon crystallization age of 1881 Â± 4 Ma (GA 93526012, Blake et al., 1999; Phillips et al., 2016), which is interpreted as the age of volcanism. This places a maximum age on the sedimentation and volcanism in the overlying Biscay Formation.  Detrital zircon populations in three Biscay Formation metasandstone samples are dominated by Paleoproterozoic age components. GSWA 206183 (Lu et al., 2017a) and GSWA 206185 (Lu et al., 2017b) are medium-grained feldspathic metasandstone samples with weighted mean &sup2;Pb*/&sup2;Pb* maximum depositional ages of 1872 Â± 5 Ma and 1872 Â± 6 Ma, respectively (Phillips et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2017a,b).

These data indicate that shallow-marine sedimentation and suggest that mafic volcanism in the Biscay Formation began <1881 Ma and continued until <1861 Ma.  The shallow-marine Biscay Formation was drowned beneath deep-marine turbidite sedimentation and felsic volcanism in the overlying Olympio Formation.

It is considered to be at least partly correlative of the DIXON RANGE FORMATION further west. In WA the formation is mainly composed of metamorphosed sandstone and siltstone, as well as felsic and mafic schist derived from a volcanic protolith. It locally overlies the Wankari Volcanics with a concordant (conformable?) contact, but is more frequently thrust over younger units. It is overlain disconformably or unconformably by the Kulail Sandstone of the basal Amadeus Basin. Although there is no direct dating of the unit, an age of c. 1030 Ma is inferred.","In WA the Bloods Range Formation is restricted to the REBECCA map sheet area where it outcrops sparsely in and between the Bloods Range and Anne Range in the north, and the Schwerin Mural Crescent in the southwest. In the NT it outcrops sparsely along the Bloods Range in the HULL and BLOODS RANGE map sheet areas.  ","The name of Bloods Range Formation is derived from Bloods Range, a series of east-west-trending ridges that cross the WA-NT border on the REBECCA (WA), and HULL and BLOODS RANGE (NT) map sheet areas. Forman (1966) used the term 'Bloods Range Beds' to include a diverse package of low-grade metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks between the Mount Harris Basalt and Dean Quartzite. Close et al. (2003) revised the Mount Harris Basalt - 'Bloods Range Beds' package into the Tjauwata Group; the substantially reduced Bloods Range Formation forming the top of that group in the NT. The type locality is on southern slope of Bloods Range, 11 km west of Mount Harris in the NT (MGA Zone 52, 541100E 7275200N; Close et al., 2003). The Bloods Range Formation is inferred to be at least partly correlative with the Dixon Range Formation that forms the top of the Tjauwata Group further west.",,"The Bloods Range Formation in WA is mainly composed of metamorphosed sandstone and siltstone, as well as felsic and mafic schist derived from a volcanic protolith. The metasiltstones are typically purple, red and grey-green fine-grained phyllitic schist. Metasandstones include psammitic schist, foliated quartzofeldspathic metasandstone, and foliated fine-grained quartzite. Metaconglomerate interbeds containing quartz pebble or polymictic clasts in a schistose matrix are present locally. Sericite schist with feldspar and quartz granules, interpreted as phenocrysts, are common away from the Schewin Mural Crescent and are considered to be metamorphosed felsic volcanic and epiclastic rocks. Outcrops across the state border in the NT are typically less metamorphosed and consist of red shales, polymictic conglomerate, volcaniclastic rocks, tuffaceous horizons and local lensoidal quartz sandstone beds (Close et al., 2003).","The depositional environment is difficult to determine in WA due to the degree of metamorphism and deformation. Less metamorphosed equivalents in the NT are considered to been deposited under fluvial and lacustrine environments contemporaneous with extrusive igneous activity (Close et al., 2003).",,,,In many areas the lower surface of the Bloods Range Formation is a thrust over younger units such as Bitter Springs Group or Dean Quartzite.

92,32054,P_-MEb-sl,1335,Blue Billy Formation,1,Siltstone and mudstone; minor thin- to thick-bedded sandstone; locally sulfidic,"The Blue Billy Formation (P_-MEb-sl) consists predominantly of siltstone and mudstone with minor thin- to thick-bedded sandstone. The unit is up to 800 m thick and exposed on the southwestern flank of the Wanna Syncline on MAROONAH, MANGAROON, and EDMUND, in the Cobra Synclinorium on MOUNT PHILLIPS, and on the Pingandy Shelf on ULLAWARRA, CAPRICORN, ELLIOTT CREEK, KENNETH RANGE, BOGGOLA, TEANO, MOUNT VERNON, and TANGADEE. It either has a sharp, conformable lower contact with the Gooragoora Formation, or a disconformable contact with the Irregully Formation. Its upper contact is either a gradational, conformable contact with the Cheyne Springs Formation, or a disconformity with the Kiangi Creek Formation. The Blue Billy Formation is composed of a distinctive parallel-planar laminated, black, pyritic, carbonaceous, fissile to flaggy siltstone, interbedded with subordinate sandstone, dolomitic siltstone and chert. Thicker deposits of sandstone and pebbly sandstone have been mapped as a separate member (P_-MEb-st) on ULLAWARRA, MAROONAH, MANGAROON, and EDMUND. The Blue Billy Formation is interpreted as a basin-wide deposit of mostly deep-marine anoxic mudstone that records transgression and expansion of the Edmund Basin beyond the preserved limits of the Pingandy Shelf. During this time, major basement structures such as the Talga Fault had little influence on Blue Billy Formation sedimentation. The age of the Blue Billy Formation is poorly known, but was probably deposited between c. 1673 and 1517 Ma.","The Blue Billy Formation is exposed on the southwestern flank of the Wanna Syncline on MAROONAH, MANGAROON, and EDMUND, in the Cobra Synclinorium on MOUNT PHILLIPS, and on the Pingandy Shelf on ULLAWARRA, CAPRICORN, ELLIOTT CREEK, KENNETH RANGE, BOGGOLA, TEANO, MOUNT VERNON, and TANGADEE. It ranges in thickness from 0 to 800 m, but is generally less than 200 m thick. The formation is thickest in the vicinity of Irregully Gorge on CAPRICORN and ULLAWARRA and thins to the south and east.","The Blue Billy Formation was established by Martin and Thorne (2002) to include those units of carbonaceous siltstone and locally developed sandstone that overlie the Gooragoora or Irregully Formations and underlie the Cheyne Springs Formation. The Blue Billy Formation is broadly correlated with the Wannery and Chubilyer Members of the Irregully Formation at Mount Florry (Daniels, 1970). It is equivalent to parts of the Kiangi Creek Formation of Daniels (1968) and Muhling and Brakel (1985), and part of the Jillawarra and Cheyne Springs Formations of Chuck (1984). The formation is also synonymous with all or part of the Jillawarra Formation and the informally named Prospect Shale of Muhling and Brakel (1985).  The Blue Billy Formation was named after Blue Billy Bore (Zone 50, MGA 439670E 7412730N) on southeastern ULLAWARRA (Martin and Thorne, 2002) and the type area is at the southern end of Irregully Gorge on ULLAWARRA, at the confluence of Doolgarrie and Irregully Creeks (Zone 50, MGA 446300E 7411600N). A type section for the formation is yet to be specified.",,"The Blue Billy Formation (P_-MEb-sl) consists mostly of a distinctive parallel-planar laminated, black, pyritic, carbonaceous, fissile to flaggy siltstone that weathers to a blue-grey colour. In addition, thick-bedded sandstone and pebbly sandstone have been mapped as a separate member (P_-MEb-st) on ULLAWARRA, MAROONAH, MANGAROON, and EDMUND. On a regional scale the siltstone becomes more dolomitic towards the top of the formation, close to the contact with the Cheyne Springs Formation.  Weathered siltstone surfaces are also commonly coated with a white efflorescence of gypsum, particularly in creek bed exposures (Martin et al., 2005). Parallel-bedded gypsum layers, with crystals oriented normal to bedding, and carbonate are present in Irregully Gorge on ULLAWARRA. Pyrite is largely weathered to goethite and hematite, and is concentrated in thin beds or laminae or disseminated throughout the rock. The characteristic blue-grey to black colour is due to finely disseminated opaques, a high total organic carbon content (up to 5%), and localized silicification. Goethite and hematite nodules and concretions are also present locally. Although there is a high proportion of total organic carbon in the Blue Billy Formation these and other units in the Edmund and Collier Groups are highly mature and have exhausted their petroleum generating potential (Ameed Ghori, written communication, 2010).   Siltstone typically consists of finely laminated coarse silt to very fine sand set in a matrix of very fine- to medium-grained silt and felted sericite with disseminated opaques (Martin et al., 2005). Recognizable detrital grains consist of angular quartz, muscovite, fresh plagioclase and K-feldspar, and indeterminate heavy minerals. Quartz grains are subrounded to rounded. A strong wavy to lenticular fabric is commonly defined by very fine grained opaques. Opaque phases consist of iron oxides (mainly after euhedral pyrite) and carbonaceous material and in some cases constitute up to 80% of the rock. Dolomitic siltstones are characterized by euhedral dolomite grains weathered to goethite or dolomite concretions with similar internal lamination to the surrounding siltstone. Silicified siltstone consists almost entirely of clastic-textured microquartz with disseminated fine-grained opaque minerals (Martin et al., 2005).  Sandstone, pebbly sandstone, and dolomitic sandstone are generally fine- to very coarse-grained and form tabular, thinly to very thickly bedded units. Fine-grained sandstone is parallel planar to ripple cross-laminated, whereas most medium- to very coarse-grained sandstone is massive to normally graded. Mudstone pebble intraclasts are observed locally in some coarser grained beds.","The Blue Billy Formation is interpreted as a basin-wide deposit of deep-marine anoxic mudstone that records transgression and expansion of the Edmund Basin beyond the preserved limits of the Pingandy Shelf (Martin et al., 2005). As is the case with the underlying Gooragoora Formation, major basement structures such as the Talga Fault had little influence on Blue Billy Formation sedimentation. Thick-bedded sandstone (P_-MEb-st) in the upper part of the Blue Billy Formation is interpreted as turbidite and mass-flow deposits (Martin and Thorne, 2004).",,800,,"On northwestern parts of the EDMUND 1:250 000 map sheet, the Blue Billy Formation overlies the Gooragoora Formation with a sharp conformable contact. Here, the basal contact is taken as the top of the uppermost sandstone of the Gooragoora Formation. Elsewhere, on ELLIOTT CREEK, KENNETH RANGE, TEANO, MOUNT VERNON, and TANGADEE, the Gooragoora Formation is absent and the Blue Billy Formation directly overlies the Irregully Formation, forming an apparent non-depositional unconformity or disconformity (Martin et al., 2005).   The Blue Billy Formation either has a gradational, conformable contact with the overlying Cheyne Springs Formation or else is truncated by a disconformity beneath the Kiangi Creek Formation.",,17,,,,4,,,,1673,,1517,,"The age of the Blue Billy Formation is poorly known, but was probably deposited between c. 1673 and 1517 Ma. This age range is based on geochronology data from underlying and overlying units within the Capricorn Orogen. Ages given by the youngest groups of detrital zircons in sandstone units of the Blue Billy Formation are maximum values only. They are at least 60 Ma older than the likely older age limit for the formation.  The maximum age of the Blue Billy Formation is constrained by its stratigraphic position, in which it either directly overlies the Gooragoora Formation (Depositional package 2) or the Irregully Formation (Depositional package 1) of the Edmund Group. The older age limit for Depositional package 1 is provided by the c. 1673 Ma maximum age of the Yilgatherra Formation (P_-MEy-st). Depositional package 1 overlies granitic rocks of the 1680-1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite in the Gascoyne Province (Sheppard et al., 2010). The Discretion Granite on MARQUIS is the youngest granite in the Durlacher Supersuite and has been dated at 1619 Â± 15 Ma (GSWA 142855, Nelson, 1998; Sheppard et al., 2010). However, the boundary between the Discretion Granite and Depositional package 1 is faulted and the true nature of the contact, whether it is intrusive or unconformable, cannot be determined.  The minimum age for the Blue Billy Formation is given by the age of the Waldburg Dolerite that intrudes underlying and overlying parts of the Edmund Group. Wingate et al. (GSWA 206916, 2015a) determined an age of 1517 Â± 8 Ma from a sill of Waldburg Dolerite, intruded into the Kiangi Creek Formation on southeastern MOUNT AUGUSTUS. Another sill, intruded along the disconformable contact between the Irregully and Kiangi Creek Formations on MOUNT AUGUSTUS, yielded an age of 1513 Â± 5 Ma (GSWA 206991, Wingate et al 2015b). Sills of the Narimbunna Dolerite, which intrude overlying units of the Edmund Group are younger than the Waldburg Dolerite and have been dated at c. 1465 Ma by Wingate (2002).   The earliest phase of mineralization in the underlying Irregully and Gooragoora Formation host rocks at the Abra polymetallic deposit has been dated at 1610 Â± 16 Ma, based on the U-Pb age of hydrothermal xenotime from the deposit (Zi et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2015). Mineralization and hydrothermal fluid flow, in the same part of the stratigraphy, continued until at least 1590 Â± 9 Ma (Zi et al. 2015). The relationship of these mineralization events to the Blue Billy Formation is unknown. However, they could have taken place either before or after the Blue Billy Formation was deposited.  Minimum ages of detrital zircons collected from the sandstone-dominated member (P_-MEb-st) of the Blue Billy Formation generally reflect the age of the local Capricorn Orogen basement. The youngest group of detrital zircons in a sample collected from a sandstone outcropping about 1 km south-southeast of Bluff Bore (Zone 50, MGA 400044E 7383487N) on EDMUND has been dated at 1746 Â± 8 Ma (GSWA 148971, Wingate et al., 2007). Martin et al. (2008) determined a maximum depositional age of 1787 Â± 4 Ma from the same data. The youngest group of detrital zircons in sample GSWA 148971 is most likely derived from the Ashburton Formation and Moorarie Supersuite, with older modes being derived from the Archean to Paleoproterozoic supracrustal successions on the southern margin of the Pilbara Craton (Martin et al., 2008). However, there may have been some contribution to these modes through minor reworking of Depositional package 1 of the Edmund Group.",No,,,2,,No,Published,No,No,P_,MEb,,,,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

3652,23405,O-CRb-slcv,112,Bongabinni Formation,1,"Mudstone, commonly calcareous or dolomitic; scattered evaporites; local organic-rich shale (subsurface only)","The upper Ordovician Bongabinni Formation is a typically red oxidized supratidal mudstone unit that forms the base of the Carribuddy Group in the Canning Basin (Lehmann, 1984; Haines, 2009, 2010). It locally includes a chemically-reduced lagoonal facies containing rich oil-prone source rocks (McCracken, 1994; Edwards, et al., 1995; Haines and Ghori, 2006).","The Bongabinni Formation is widespread in the Canning Basin south of the Fenton Fault, with distribution similar to that of the entire Carribuddy Group. It may also be present in the Fitzroy Trough and Gregory Sub-basin to the north, but if so, is too deep to be intersected by exploration wells. Its presence over the Barbwire Terrace is uncertain (Haines, 2009). The thickest known intersection, 208 m, is in the type section in Kidson 1. Where the top of the formation can be distinguished in the Willara Sub-basin and southern Broome Platform it is typically around or less than 100 m in thickness. Average thickness decreases to the north across the Broome Platform and is typically only 30-40 m on the Mowla Terrace. In areas where neither Minjoo Salt nor Mount Troy Formation can be recognized the top of the formation and thickness cannot be determined.","Lehmann (1984) named the Bongabinni Formation after Bongabinni Native Well (between Canning Stock Route Well 35 and 36), and nominated the type section as the interval 4071-4279 m in Kidson 1 to replace the earlier informal  Carribuddy Unit E  of Johnson (1966) in that well. However, the formation does not equate directly with  Carribuddy Unit E  as applied to a number of other wells drilled from the mid 1960s to mid 1970s that include what was later recognized as Nita Formation (Kidson 1 lacks an unequivocal Nita Formation).",,"The following lithological summary is from Haines (2009). At its type section the Bongabinni Formation is dominated by red-brown mudstone, which is often calcareous or dolomitic, and contains interbeds of argillaceous dolomite and rare thin beds, veins, and scattered crystals of halite and anhydrite (Johnson, 1966). Although predominantly red-brown and oxidized, the mudstone does display local greenish-grey to olive-grey mottling, streaks, and reduction spots. Similar massive red-brown mudstone is a dominant component of the Bongabinni Formation in most areas, with the exception of parts of the Admiral Bay Fault Zone. In areas where the underlying Nita Formation is well developed, a lower unit of the Bongabinni Formation, transitional between the carbonate-dominated Nita Formation and the massive mudstone of the upper Bongabinni Formation, can be recognized and is distinguished informally on the tratigraphic charts. This lower unit contains sparse cyclical dolomite or limestone beds up to several metres in thickness, and typically traceable for considerable distances between wells using wireline log data.  A significant facies change is observed in petroleum wells and mineral exploration drillholes along the Admiral Bay Fault Zone. Here the Bongabinni Formation is quite calcareous or less commonly dolomitic, including beds of argillaceous limestone and minor dolomite. It is also predominantly chemically reduced as indicated by the grey-green, and grey to black colours of the mudstone when fresh. Pyrite is often present. Some of the mudstone is organic rich, and centimetre- to metre-scale beds of black coal-like material found in several cored mineral exploration drillholes in this area have excellent oil-prone source properties (McCracken, 1994; Edwards, et al., 1995; Haines and Ghori, 2006). Scattered evaporite pseudomorphs are found in the Bongabinni Formation in this area, and increase in abundance up section.","The Bongabinni Formation is mostly an oxidized marginal marine to supratidal deposit (Haines, 2009, 2010). Deposition occurred under conditions of very low relief and minimal influx of coarse siliciclastic detritus to the basin. During deposition of the Bongabinni Formation the Admiral Bay Fault Zone hosted a local system of lagoons in which chemically reduced and organic-rich sediments could accumulate in contrast to the surrounding oxidized supratidal flats. Localization of these unique deposits along the fault zone suggests fault-controlled accommodation, possibly allowing an elongate inlet from the open sea which likely lay to the west at this time. The lack of obvious marine fauna or bioturbation, and the sparse distribution of evaporite minerals suggest at least periodically hypersaline conditions that would have precluded normal marine fauna.",30,208,,"The Bongabinni Formation conformably and gradationally overlies the Nita Formation (Cudalgarra Member) in most areas. The lithostratigraphic boundary is thus somewhat arbitrary. By common usage it is picked at a point were the cyclical and predominantly carbonate section of the Nita Formation gives way to predominantly mudstone up section, the actual boundary being placed at the top of the last of the closely spaced carbonate cycles. Carbonate cycles up to several metres in thickness are present in both the upper Nita Formation, and lower Bongabinni Formation (but sparser in the latter) and individual cycles can often be correlated with confidence for several hundred kilometres on wireline logs. If these cycles form approximate time markers, as seems likely, the implication is that the formation boundary, as picked by the above method, is somewhat diachronous, being slightly older in the southwest and younger towards the northeast (Haines, 2009). The contact between the Carribuddy Group and older successions is locally disconformable to unconformable on the Barbwire Terrace, but it is unclear if the Bongabinni Formation is present as the basal unit in these area (for more detail see Carribuddy Group above). The Bongabinni Formation is conformably overlain by the Minjoo Salt, with the contact picked at the base of the first significant bedded halite unit. Where the Minjoo Salt is absent the unit is locally conformably overlain by the laterally equivalent Mount Troy Formation. In this case the gradational boundary withe the more dolomitic Mount Troy Formation is typically picked on wireline logs. Where neither the Minjoo Salt nor Mount Troy Formation can be distinguished the Bongabinni interval becomes the lower part of undifferentiated Carribuddy Group.",,17,,,,4,,,,470,,443.4,,"No precise biostratigraphic age for the Bongabinni Formation is possible.

It outcrops in an area 60 km northwest and 80 km northeast of Paynes Find.  The dominant component of the suite is the Narndee Igneous Complex (A-ANna-xony-any), which is about 30 km in diameter and divided into three layered zones. The Fields Find Igneous Complex (A-ANff-xoaph-og), lying to the west is about 13 km across is not divided into zones and its upper portions form fractionated sills interleaved with country rocks of the Norie Group. The suite is distinguished from the approximately 10 Ma older and, volumetrically larger Meeline Suite by the presence of significant primary igneous hornblende (Scowen, 1991; Ivanic et al., 2010).","The Boodanoo Suite outcrops on COOLAMANINU, THUNDELARRA, BUNGAR and NINGHAN, covering an area of approximately 2500 km 2 . The suite comprises the Narndee Igneous Complex and the Fields Find Igneous Complex. It is best exposed in the southwestern portion of the Narndee Igneous Complex, approximately four kilometres north of Tandys Bore (Zone 50, MGA 610924E 6784821N) where weather-resistant ridges of fresh cumulate rocks expose portions of the complex's lower and middle zones.","The Boodanoo Suite (Van Kranendonk and Ivanic, 2009; Ivanic et al., 2010) is named after abandoned Boodanoo Homestead (Zone 50 MGA 624000E 6822000N), located on COOLAMANINU.  The type section for the Boodanoo Suite is within the Narndee Igneous Complex. It is a traverse from west to east from site TJIWIN000336 (Zone 50, MGA 611363E 6789091N) to TJIWIN000326 (Zone 50, MGA 612891E 6789239N) on BUNGAR. In this section cyclical layering is evident on a hectometre scale with each cycle involving several lithologies. Each cycle typically starts at its base with a serpentinized peridotite and evolves through pyroxenite to leucogabbro at the top with each lithology being  approximately 30 m thick. Each of these lithologies contains up to 15 % modal igneous hornblende, with additional secondary amphibole present in metamorphosed areas. See also Localities 5.1 and 5.2 (Ivanic, 2016).  Along this section there are good examples of primary magmatic layering features such as modal igneous layering or crystal lamination. These features indicate that the layering dips approximately 40&deg; to the east. Approximately half way along this section there is a conformable contact between the lower and middle zones of the Narndee Igneous Complex. On a small scale this contact is not conspicuous, however it marks the change from a pyroxenite-rich lower zone (to the west) to a more gabbronorite-rich middle zone (to the east). Locally, metagranitic rocks of the Mount Kenneth Suite can be seen to intrude into the complex and regions around these metagranitic rocks are typically strongly amphibolitized with a near vertical, north-south trending foliation.",,"The Boodanoo Suite contains a wide variety of intrusive lithologies which are covered in more detail in the lithology sections of the child units of the Narndee and Fields Find igneous complexes. The lithologies range from hornblende-bearing ultramafic cumulates to modally layered pyroxenites and gabbroic cumulates with up to 15% hornblende. The suite is distinctively rich in ultramafic lithologies compared to other suites of the Annean Supersuite. More evolved parts of the suite, such as the middle zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex, hornblende gabbro dominates with large hornblende oikocrysts forming up to 10% of the rock. In the upper parts of the Fields Find Igneous Complex, which is not divided into zones, are several layer-parallel, fractionated sills interleaved with country rocks (e.g. A-ANff-od).   Whole rock AFM compositions for the suite fall in the tholeiitic field (e.g. Scowen, 1991), but are not distinctly iron-enriched as with typical tholeiitic trends. The suite has distinctly elevated light rare earth element compositions compared to the flat trace element profiles of Meeline Suite (A-ANM-xony-amy). Isotope chemistry of the Narndee Igneous Complex is discussed in Ivanic et al. (2015) where the high water contents are demonstrated to be related to elevated water content within the mantle source.  Regions of the suite dominated by ultramafic lithologies are host to several minor Ni-Cu-PGE deposits. These are typically located towards the bases of each intrusion.",,,6000,,"The Boodanoo Suite intrudes into Norie Group metasedimentary rocks, which can be observed in the southeast of the Narndee Igneous Complex where gabbroic rocks of the lower zone are interleaved with metasedimentary rafts of the Norie Group (TJIWIN090546, Zone 50, MGA 630179E 6787243N). Further to the southeast is a large granitic intrusion assigned to the Rothsay Suite, which locally hosts intrudes into the lower zone. These metasedimentary rocks are typically cordierite-rich and locally form granoblastic xenoliths within gabbros of the lower zone (TJIUMF160009, Zone 50, MGA 632427E 6805557N), hence likely a result of contact metamorphism from intrusion of the suite. At the Fields Find Igneous Complex, the top of the intrusion is composed of a series of sills, which intrude into less-distinctly baked siliciclastic rocks (e.g. TJISIN120458, Zone 50, MGA 523237E 6787330N).  Abundant intrusions of metagranite of the Mount Kenneth Suite (A-ANK-mg, e.g. TJIWIN000750, Zone 50, MGA 610703E 6793971N) crosscut the Boodanoo Suite (especially in the vicinity of the Narndee Igneous Complex). These form small plugs and dykes, and larger apophyses which locally stope off 100 m scale rafts of amphibolitized gabbros and ultramafic rocks. Dykes of porphyritic rhyolite of the Mount Kenneth Suite (A-ANK-gnap) also locally crosscut both these metagranitic rocks and rocks of the complex. In the southwest of the complex, possible hybrid rocks are present adjacent to dated metagranitic intrusions of Mount Kenneth Suite (e.g. TJIWIN000917, Zone 50, MGA 611891E 6785453N).  The intrusion of the Mount Kenneth and Rothsay suites into the Narndee Igneous Complex is likely responsible for local metamorphism and deformation. However, the majority of deformation (and metamorphism) across the extent of the suite is likely due to intrusion of the Big Bell and Tuckanarra suites (e.g. at geochronology sample site MTWBUN000162, Zone 50, MGA 610848E 6785494N, GSWA 185997, Wingate et al., 2015b).",,17,,,Mixed,9,,,,2799,,2799,,"The age of the Boodanoo Suite is known only from as the age of the Narndee Igneous Complex (i.e. 2799 Â± 7 Ma, Wingate et al., 2010), which is its principal and most comprehensively described component. The Fields Find Igneous Complex currently has no local chronological constraints despite several attempts to recover zircons. Uncertainty on the age of the Narndee Igneous Complex allows for the Boodanoo Suite to be either contemporaneous with the latest Norie Group volcanic episode or the earliest volcanism of the Polelle Group. In the vicinity of the Narndee Igneous Complex, a meta-andesite has been dated at 2819 Â± 3 Ma (GSWA 193979, Wingate et al., 2012a), which is the singular age constraint on the stratigraphy into which the suite intrudes. Also in the vicinity of the Narndee Igneous Complex are crosscutting granitic rocks of the Mount Kenneth Suite, which have been dated as within error of the age of the Boodanoo Suite (e.g. 2803 Â± 4 Ma, GSWA 185996: Wingate et al., 2015; 2811 Â± 7 Ma: GSWA 193967, Wingate et al., 2012b).

Between 977 and 1011.5 m, there are common mud intraclasts and cross-bed drapes, perhaps indicative of tidal channel deposition. The 1011.5 - 1046 m interval is similarly cross bedded, but more unimodal and mud drapes are absent. There are possible  Skolithos -type burrows, symmetrical ripples, and scattered pebbles, all indicative of a coastal distributary setting. Coarse-grained and pebbly sandstone dominates between 1046 and 1067.5 m, in fining-upward cycles capped by finer grained sandstone and siltstone, suggesting a higher energy braided fluvial setting.

Its top marks the end of banded iron-formation (BIF) deposition in the Mount Bruce Supergroup. The maximum thickness in the vicinity of Yeera Bluff on PANNAWONICA is about 450 m. It generally consists of two or three flaggy to fissile iron formation-dominated units separated by shaly intervals. It is about 200 m thick in the type section south of Boolgeeda Creek on ROCKLEA. A predominantly epiclastic basal sedimentary unit is also locally preserved in paraconformable contact with the Woongarra Rhyolite. The depositional age of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation is poorly constrained, but may be significantly younger than the c. 2444 Ma minimum age of the Woongarra Rhyolite. The formation is paraconformably overlain by the Turee Creek Group, and contains a distinctive glacigenic diamictite overlain by the uppermost BIF unit, which together comprise the Cave Hill Member (P_-HAov-se). The depositional environment of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation is interpreted to have been primarily in deep water, well below storm wave base. Nevertheless, the presence of abundant fine-grained siliciclastic and volcaniclastic material and glacigenic diamictites records a significant change in provenance and probably also basin architecture, involving uplift to the south of the Hamersley Basin.","The Boolgeeda Iron Formation is mainly exposed in the cores of major regional synclines throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region on FORTESCUE, PANNAWONICA, MOUNT STUART, WYLOO, HARDEY, ROCKLEA, MILLSTEAM, JEERINAH, MOUNT LIONEL, PARABURDOO, SNOWY MOUNT, ROY HILL, NEWMAN, MURRAMUNDA, and JIGALONG. In many of these areas, the upper part, especially the Cave Hill Member is either not preserved or is covered by Cenozoic detritus.","The Boolgeeda Iron Formation is generally considered to consist of two BIF units separated by a shale horizon, although a basal shale unit is also locally present. However, a third iron formation unit can be locally discerned. It is underlain by glacigenic diamictite and sandstone, similar to the Meteorite Bore Member of the Kungarra Formation in the overlying Turee Creek Group (Martin, 1999). This interval of diamictite and BIF has been named the Cave Hill Member (P_-HAov-se) and, where preserved, forms a topographically distinct unit above the second BIF unit. The Boolgeeda Iron Formation derives its name from Boolgeeda Creek on ROCKLEA, where a type section (Zone 50, MGA 506620E 7501070N) was defined by MacLeod et al. (1963). The Cave Hill Member does not appear to be exposed in this type section. A reference section at Woongarra Gorge (starting at Zone 50, MGA 510590E 7469510N) is about 150 m thick and also contains the Cave Hill Member.",,"The Boolgeeda Iron Formation is distinctly different from other BIF units in the Hamersley Group. It consists of dark greyish brown to black, highly magnetic, fissile to flaggy, finely laminated iron formation that lacks the chert-BIF mesobanding and microbanding that is typical of other units in the group. The iron formation is interbedded with laminated fissile siltstone and minor chert, and is also locally jaspilitic, resembling the striped facies of the Weeli Wolli Formation (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). Chert mesobands are rare and are thicker and more coarsely and faintly microbanded than those of the Brockman Iron Formation. In outcrop, these iron formations constitute three intervals separated by shaly lithofacies. They are dominated by laminated siltstone and mudstone with minor chert and iron formation, although Howard (2013) has identified at least eleven lithological units in drillcore. Even though not formally recognized, these lithological variations are similar to the macrobands of Trendall (1965) that are typical of the Brockman Iron Formation. The basal shale unit is not present everywhere and consists of planar-laminated siltstone to mudstone with rare thin grey chert beds and local fine-grained, planar-laminated, graded volcaniclastic sandstone beds. Lithologies at this stratigraphic level have been described in some areas as peperites by Trendall (1995), but this interpretation has not been confirmed. The lower iron formation unit consists of dense, brownish black, well-laminated iron formation with a flaggy appearance. The middle shale interval is generally poorly exposed, forming a distinctive recessive weathering unit in the middle of the formation. It consists predominantly of planar-laminated siltstone with minor ferruginous siltstone and white chert. A thin tuff bed is present near the base of the unit at Woongarra Gorge on ROCKLEA. The second iron formation unit is finer grained and more finely laminated than the first, with a distinctive shaly appearance. The uppermost shale and BIF interval, which constitutes the Cave Hill Member is not preserved everywhere. In addition to laminated siltstone and mudstone, the Cave Hill Member also contains locally well-preserved glacigenic diamictite, sandstone, and conglomerate (Martin, 1999; van Kranendonk and Mazumder, 2015), and the iron formation resembles that of the underlying unit.","The depositional environment of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation is interpreted as primarily having been deep water well below storm wave base, similar to other BIF units in the Hamersley Group. However, the presence of abundant fine-grained siliciclastic and volcaniclastic material and glacigenic diamictites records a significant change in provenance and probably also basin architecture, compared to underlying units of the Hamersley Group. In particular, glacial dropstones in the Cave Hill Member, derived from the Woongarra Rhyolite (Martin, 1999), indicate significant uplift to the south of the preserved margin of Hamersley Basin at this time.",,450,,"The basal contact of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation appears to be mostly conformable with the underlying Woongarra Rhyolite, although this contact has been interpreted by Trendall (1995) to be intrusive.

The basal shaly interval most likely filled in topographic depressions prior to the ubiquitous deposition of BIF throughout the region. The upper contact appears conformable on a regional scale, but detailed investigations have shown a local absence of the Cave Hill Member, suggesting that this contact is most likely to be paraconformable. Wherever it is exposed, the transition from BIF of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation to shale of the Turee Creek Group is sharp and marked by the absence of magnetite-rich BIF in the latter. Shales above the contact are distinctively green-weathered and pyritic with local thin white chert beds, as opposed to shales within the Boolgeeda Iron Formation, which are red- to purple-weathered.",,17,,,,4,,,,2444,,2420,,"The age of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation must be younger than the youngest magmatic age of the underlying Woongarra Rhyolite (2444 Â± 3 Ma, GSWA 195892, M.

The unit unconformably overlies rocks of the Hamersley, Ashburton, and Blair Basins and is unconformably overlain by rocks of the Edmund Basin. The Bresnahan Group was deposited in a continental setting dominated by proximal to distal alluvial deposits and playa-lake sediments.

The group status of the unit is currently under review.","The Bresnahan Group has a maximum thickness of about 4000 m and outcrops on the TANGADEE, BOGGOLA, KALLENIA, KUNDERONG, PRAIRIE DOWNS, GOVERNOR, and OPHTHALMIA 1:100 000 map sheets.","The Bresnahan Group was first described by Talbot (1926), and was mapped by Halligan and Daniels (1964), Daniels and MacLeod (1965), and Daniels (1968). A summary of Bresnahan Group geology is given by Daniels (1975) and Goode (1981). Ewers and Ferguson (1985) described a prospective uranium deposit near the basal unconformity. More recent summaries of the Bresnahan Group are given by Hunter (1990), Thorne and Seymour (1991), Thorne et al. (1991), and Krapez (1999).  The Bresnahan Group was subdivided by Daniels and MacLeod (1965) into the lower Cherrybooka Conglomerate and the overlying Kunderong Sandstone. This scheme was not followed by Thorne and Seymour (1991) and Thorne et al. (1991), who noted that the boundary between these formations is often indistinct and they do not always form clearly mappable units.  Whether or not the Bresnahan Group is a correlative of the Mount Augustus Sandstone, as proposed by Cooper et al. (1998) remains equivocal. Both units are present in approximately the same stratigraphic position and are composed largely of thick fluvial deposits, derived from a granitic source area to the northwest and west of their respective outcrop areas. However, there is no observed continuity between the two units, and this, together with the poor age controls on both units, renders a direct correlation uncertain.",,"The Bresnahan Group is composed of sandstone, pebbly sandstone, pebble- to boulder-conglomerate, and siltstone. The sandstone and conglomerate units are resistant to weathering and erosion, and outcrop as prominent strike ridges and hills.  Coarse- to very coarse-grained sandstone, pebbly sandstone and minor conglomerate forms a lenticular bedded sequence (tabular bedded parallel to the paleocurrent trend), up to 4 km thick (Thorne and Seymour, 1991). Individual beds are generally 0.2-2.0 m thick, and, in many cases, include a pebble or cobble lag above the basal scour surface. Internal structure is dominated by single or stacked sets of medium- to large-scale trough cross-stratification. Paleocurrent data are strongly unidirectional for any locality, and record an easterly directed paleoflow. Fine- to medium-grained sandstone forms tabular to lenticular beds that are generally interbedded with siltstone. The thickest fine-to medium-grained sandstone beds display trough cross-stratification; thin beds are generally parallel laminated and show locally developed current lineations, ripples, and flute markings. Ball-and-pillow structures are abundant locally.   Sandstone is composed of quartz and lithic fragments with various amounts of feldspar and mica. Accumulations of heavy minerals (including iron and titanium oxides, tourmaline, and apatite) are present throughout the sandstone, but are particularly abundant in the central northern outcrops where they occur in laminated bands up to 0.1 m thick. Elsewhere the accumulations form at the asymptotes and bases of the trough cross-strata (Thorne and Seymour, 1991).  Pebble, cobble, and boulder conglomerates are widespread in the lower part of the Bresnahan Group where they are typically interbedded with sandstone and small amounts of siltstone, and fill small paleovalleys and hollows on the underlying surface (Thorne and Seymour, 1991). Locally, this buried topography has a relief of at least 30 m. The conglomerates are often thick bedded (1-10 m), very poorly sorted, unstratified, and show a mixture of clast and matrix support. Maximum clast size is up to 1.5 m and the matrix consists of purple, poorly sorted, micaceous granule sandstone. Very thickly bedded conglomerates may incorporate lenticular horizons of very coarse-grained sandstone, up to several metres thick. Most conglomerate units contain well-rounded, subspherical clasts of sandstone, pebbly sandstone, chert, vein quartz (generally tourmaline bearing), and jaspilite.  Siltstone is generally interlayered with thinly to medium-bedded sandstone in the upper part of the Bresnahan Group, but is also interbedded with conglomerate and coarse-grained sandstone in paleovallleys and depressions at the base of the stratigraphy. Siltstones are generally parallel laminated and micaceous. ","Hunter (1990) and Thorne and Seymour (1991) suggest that deposition in the Bresnahan Basin began in response to post-D2 a  southeasterly directed extension along the southern Pilbara margin. Close to the faulted western margin of the basin, debris-flow conglomerates and thin, laterally restricted lacustrine sequences were deposited in small valleys and hollows on the Bresnahan Group basal unconformity. Farther east, middle parts of the alluvial-fan system were characterized by gravelly braided fluvial channels that passed downslope into sandy braided channels and distal playa lakes. Evolution of the Bresnahan Basin was controlled by further east-west extension that caused backstepping of the western margin of the basin and the development of a new alluvial fan system west of the initial fan body. Krapez (1999) interpreted the Bresnahan Basin as a pull-apart basin that developed in a transcurrent corridor between the Pilbara and Yilgarn Cratons.",,4000,,"The Bresnahan Group unconformably overlies Archean to Paleoproterozoic rocks of the Hamersley, Ashburton, and Blair Basins and is unconformably overlain by late Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic rocks of the Edmund Basin.",,17,,,,2,,,,1786,,1610,,"The age of the Bresnahan Group is poorly constrained, but regional relationships indicate that these rocks were probably deposited between c. 1786 and 1610 Ma.  The Bresnahan Group post-dates the D2 a  event, which was responsible for deformation in the underlying Wyloo and Capricorn Groups. The D2 a  event also affected the Boolaloo Granodiorite, which has an igneous crystallization age of 1786 Â± 5 Ma (Krapez and McNaughton, 1999; Martin et al., 2005), thus constraining the maximum age of the Bresnahan Group. Gold mineralization at the Mount Olympus deposit, southeast of Paraburdoo, also post-dates the D2 a  event and has an age of c. 1738 Ma (Sener et al., 2005); however, the timing of this mineralization relative to deposition of the Bresnahan Group is unknown.   The younger age limit for the Bresnahan Group is fixed by the minimum age for the lower part of the Edmund Group. This is given by age of the earliest phase of mineralization in the Irregully and Gooragoora Formation host rocks at the Abra polymetallic deposit.

The mafic and ultramafic rocks have been metamorphosed to amphibolite facies grade. The mineral assemblages vary due to the level of alteration and the protolith type, but the dominant minerals are tremolite-actinolite-chlorite-talc-serpentinite-biotite-ilmenite. Primary pyroxenes are replaced by a magnesium-rich chlorite, and in some sections porphyroblasts are formed by a coarse tremolite. Small (<2mm) white spots and very thin veins are formed by secondary carbonate and talc. Rare small (<8mm) oval-shaped varioles are mantled by ilmenite and are lighter in colour from the surrounding host rock due to a lower concentration of mafic minerals within a fine felsic mosaic.    Thin (<2m) very fine-grained silicified metasedimentary units are not exposed, or are very poorly preserved in outcrop, but are revealed in diamond drill core (e.g. Focus Minerals, drill core GHD003, 308.7-308.9m).

4113,2602,P_-HAb-cib,4103,Brockman Iron Formation,1,"Banded iron-formation, chert, mudstone, and siltstone; minor dolerite sills","The Brockman Iron Formation is one of the most economically important stratigraphic units in Australia. It is renowned for hosting some of the largest and highest-grade iron ore deposits in the central part of the southern Pilbara region and is also well known for containing the largest volume of banded iron-formation (BIF) in the world. The formation is formally subdivided into four members, with economic iron ore deposits restricted to the lowermost Dales Gorge Member. The Dales Gorge Member is overlain - in stratigraphic order - by the Whaleback Shale Member, Joffre Member, and Yandicoogina Shale Member. The thickness (about 550 m) and lithology (BIF and shale) of the Brockman Iron Formation is remarkably consistent throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region, although significant local reductions in thickness are associated with the formation of iron ore deposits. Rare dolerite sills are intruded into the upper parts of the formation in the western part of the Hamersley Basin. The Brockman Iron Formation conformably overlies the Mount McRae Shale and is conformably overlain by the Weeli Wolli Formation. The lithological composition of the Brockman Iron Formation and the absence of sedimentary structures formed above storm wave base implies that deposition was exclusively pelagic and hemipelagic. Formation took place in front of a carbonate platform located to the northeast between c. 2494 and 2451 Ma.","The Brockman Iron Formation is exposed throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region on the 1:250 000 map sheets DAMPIER, YARRALOOLA, PYRAMID, WYLOO, MOUNT BRUCE, ROY HILL, TUREE CREEK, NEWMAN, and ROBERTSON where it forms spectacular cliffs and large hills that constitute the Hamersley and Ophthalmia Ranges. It is well exposed in deep gorges incised into these ranges during post-Miocene uplift of the province, especially within the Karijini National Park. The thickness (about 550 m) and lithology of the Brockman Iron Formation is remarkably consistent throughout the Hamersley Basin (Trendall and Blockley, 1970), although significant local reductions in thickness are associated with the formation of iron ore deposits.","The Brockman Iron Formation was defined by MacLeod et al. (1963) who specified the type locality as Mount Brockman (Zone 50, MGA 531436E 7515995N). Ryan and Blockley (1965) recognized a fivefold informal subdivision. Subsequently Trendall and Blockley (1970) formalized a fourfold subdivision, which from bottom to top consists of the Dales Gorge Member, Whaleback Shale Member, Joffre Member, and Yandicoogina Shale Member. No single type section has been defined for the Brockman Iron Formation, although Trendall and Blockley (1970) define type sections for each of the constituent members.",,"The Brockman Iron Formation is one of the most economically important stratigraphic units in Australia. It is renowned for hosting some of the largest and highest-grade iron ore deposits in the central part of the southern Pilbara region (MacLeod, 1966; Harmsworth et al., 1990). It is also well known for containing the largest volume of banded iron-formation (BIF) in the world (Trendall and Blockley, 1970; Trendall, 1983).  The Brockman Iron Formation consists predominantly of planar laminated BIF and shale with minor dolerite sills, porcelanite, submarine ashfall tuff, and dolomite. Perhaps the most striking feature of the Brockman Iron Formation is the regularity of its layering on all scales. It led Trendall (1965) to define three scales of layering, which he termed macrobanding, mesobanding, and microbanding. Macrobanding is the interlayering of different lithologies, primarily BIF and shale, which characterizes outcrops at the metre scale. Mesobanding refers to alternating layers of chert and iron formation that are of the order of centimetres to decimetres thick and give BIF macrobands their characteristic banded appearance. Microbands are the finely alternating iron- and chert-rich layers which are manifested at the millimetre- to submillimeter-scale within mesobands. The shales of the Brockman Iron Formation are characteristically stilpnomelane-rich with an iron content compatible with iron formation. They consist of a mixture of terrigenous mudstone and siltstone, and mafic and felsic volcaniclastic ashfall tuff (Alibert and McCullouch, 1993; Pickard et al., 2004). Five black porcelanite layers (Trendall and Blockley, 1970) form distinctive markers within the lower Joffre Member and consist of black, flinty potassic feldspar with a distinctive conchoidal fracture. Pickard (2002) describes these layers as tuffaceous mudrocks. Two additional porcelanites have also been identified in the upper Jeerinah Formation (Pickard, 2002). Dolomite is present either as rare, thin, fine-grained turbidites at various stratigraphic levels (Trendall and Blockley, 1970; KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003) or as megaclasts and debris flows within the middle Joffre Member (Kepert, 2001). Dolerite sills are rare within the Brockman Iron Formation and appear to have been intruded exclusively into the middle Joffre Member in the western part of the southern Pilbara region.","The lithological composition of the Brockman Iron Formation and the absence of sedimentary structures formed above storm wave base implies that deposition was exclusively pelagic and hemipelagic, and took place in front of a carbonate platform. Early interpretations suggested that deposition happened in a barred basin (Trendall, 1975) or a submerged volcanogenic platform or bank and precluded deposition in a deep ocean basin (Morris and Horwitz, 1983). More recent studies interpret deposition to have taken place on basin floor fans in an ocean basin that deepened to the southwest (Simonson et al., 1993; KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003; Pickard et al., 2004). The presence of carbonate turbidites and debris flows confirms a depositional setting that was basinward of a platform, rather than on it. Abundant input of volcaniclastic ashfall detritus is suggestive of a volcanically active basin, probably located in a back-arc setting (Blake and Barley, 1992).   Microband pairs within chert and chert matrix of the Hamersley Group have been interpreted by Trendall (1972) as varves, with each microband representing one year of deposition of colloidal chemical precipitates (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). However, the origin of microbanding within Hamersley Group BIF remains contentious. Recent studies suggest that the primary sediments were not solely the product of pelagic settling of colloidal chemical precipitates (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003; Pickard et al., 2004), and that much of the present-day mineralogical composition is the product of post-depositional processes. It is therefore not a proxy for the oceanic or atmospheric chemistry (Bekker et al., 2014; Rasmussen et al., 2013, 2015, 2016).",,550,,"The Brockman Iron Formation conformably overlies the Mount McRae Shale and, in turn, is conformably overlain by the Weeli Wolli Formation. The base is sharp and well defined by the contact between BIF (macroband BIF0) and shale that is situated approximately 1 m above a distinctive marker horizon ( Trendall s bed of holes ) at the top of the underlying informal Colonial Chert member of the Mount McRae Shale. The top contact is less easy to define due to the intrusion of dolerite sills into the overlying Weeli Wolli Formation. The lowermost of these sills slightly transgresses the contact between the Yandicoogina Shale Member and BIF of the overlying Weeli Wolli Formation. Since both, shale and dolerite are commonly deeply weathered and recessive, the contact is usually placed at the base of the first BIF unit in the Weeli Wolli Formation, or at the first BIF/shale contact above the Yandicoogina Shale Member where a sill is not present at the upper contact. In any case, this contact is covered by Cenozoic detritus and in outcrop is very difficult to place with certainty.",,17,,,,4,,,,2494,,2451,,"The maximum age of the Brockman Iron Formation is constrained by a 2504 Â± 5 Ma ashfall tuff bed in the underlying Mount McRae Shale (Rasmussen et al., 2005), and the minimum age by a 2449 Â± 3 Ma tuff bed in the overlying Weeli Wolli Formation (Barley et al., 1997). The inferred age range of the Brockman Iron Formation, based on available geochronology, thickness, and calculated compacted depositional rates is 2494-2451 (Trendall et al., 2004). Many of the ashfall tuff horizons within the Brockman Iron Formation have been dated. They provide depositional ages ranging from 2495 Â± 16 to 2454 Â± 3 Ma (Trendall et al., 1998; Pickard, 2002; Trendall et al., 2004).",No,,,4,,No,Published,No,Yes,P_,HAb,,,,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

Thick evaporite intyervals within the Browne Formation have mobilised at several times and formed salt diapirs and salt walls, generally above older basement structures.There are no confirmed exposures other than in the Madley and Woolnough Diapirs. The Browne Formation contains abundant evaporites, and was deposited in a strongly evaporitic restricted marine, peritidal to intertidal or lagoonal environments with strong oxidizing influences. Substantial dunefields were present towards the basin margin, evidenced by the thick eolian interval in Lancer 1. From the core in Empress 1A and Lancer 1, there is no indication of any deep-water environments.","The Browne Formation was originally named for intersections in drillholes Hunt Oil Browne 1 (between 132.59 and 386.79 m, TD) and Browne 2 (between 262.13 and 292.79 m) in the southeast corner of BROWNE 1:250 000 sheet. It was subsequently intersected in BMR Madley 1, BMR Warri 20, Kanpa 1A, Yowalga 3, Dragoon 1, Hussar 1, GSWA Empress 1A, and GSWA Lancer 1 (Jackson et al., 1984; Phillips et al., 1985; Townson, 1985; Stevens and Apak, 1999; Perincek, 1998). Exposures of dolomite and sandstone containing poorly preserved Basisphaera irregularis on COOPER 1:250 000 sheet were assigned to Townsend Quartzite or Punkerri Sandstone by Jackson and van de Graaff (1981), but are probably Browne Formation, based on the presence of  B. irregularis .  The thicker intersections of Browne Formation are mostly through diapirs or salt walls. They range from >254 m in Browne 1 through >1596 m in Dragoon 1 to 2304 m in Yowalga 3. Farther south, the Browne Formation thickens from Empress 1A through Kanpa 1 to Yowalga 3. It is 275 m thick in Empress 1A, but the lower Browne Formation is absent, 1156 m and nearly complete in Kanpa 1, and 2304 m in Yowalga 3. Seismic interpretations suggest that at least 4000 m of Browne Formation may be present in a major salt wall extending southeastwards through the Yowalga area.  On lithology alone, the Browne Formation shows remarkable lateral continuity of thickness with limited lateral facies changes (Grey et al., 2005). Between Empress 1A and Lancer 1 (260 km distance), the thickness is similar, and there is a change from a section of evaporites in the upper Browne Formation to eolian sandstone in Lancer 1. The lower Browne Formation is slightly sandier but otherwise very similar. Between Lancer 1 and Boondawari 1 (about 300 km distance), there is a similar persistence of thickness and broad lithology. The lower Browne Formation in Lancer 1 can be correlated with the lower Mundadjini Formation in Boondawari 1, the Lancer Member with the middle sandstone and overlying sandy siltstone of the Mundadjini Formation in Boondawari 1, and the lower Hussar Formation with the mudstone at the top of both Boondawari 1 and Mundadjini 1.","Jackson (1966) proposed the name  Browne Evaporites  for an evaporitic succession intersected in drillholes on southeast BROWNE. The name was published but not defined by Peers and Trendall (1968). Lowry et al. (1972) modified the name to  Browne Beds  and defined the formation. Jackson and van de Graaff (1981) published a more detailed description, and Cockbain and Hocking (1989) revised the name to Browne Formation. Wells and Moss (1983) referred to the  Browne beds .  Grey et al. (2005) included the Woolnough and Madley Formations of Jackson and van de Graaff (1981) and Cockbain and Hocking (1989) in the Browne Formation, not only because Browne has priority but also because both are best considered as a member within the formation, the Woolnough Member. The member has the Woolnough Diapier as its type locality.  In GSWA Lancer 1, the upper Browne Formation between 1202 and 1479 m is a thick, eolian sandstone instead of the evaporitic facies seen elsewhere. This is named the Lancer Member (Haines et al., 2004).  Lowry et al. (1972) designated the interval from 132.6 to 386.8 m in Browne 1 as the type section of the Browne Formation. This section has been affected by diapirism. Early descriptions were supplemented by data from Browne 2 (Lowry et al., 1972; Jackson and van de Graaff, 1981), where the interval between 262.1 and 292.8 m provides an important reference section. The cored section through the Browne Formation in Empress 1A (Stevens and Apak, 1999), between 1247.1 and 1521.8 m (1249.1 and 1524.0 m log depth) is an additional reference section, with the comment that it spans only the upper part of the formation (Grey et al., 2005). Yowalga 3 between 3320 and 3744 m (TD) and Kanpa 1A from 3288 and 3671 m (the contact with an underlying sandstone, either Townsend Quartzite or more probably an older Mesoproterozoic sandstone) provide reference sections for the lower Browne Formation.",,"The lithological description here is largely excerpted from Grey at al (2005). The Browne Formation is a mixed sequence of fine-grained dolomite or dolomitic limestone, anhydrite, gypsum, halite, siltstone, and shale, in part calcareous. The formation is commonly brecciated and contorted in the vicinity of diapirs, and secondary recrystallization and evaporite inclusions are widespread. Diapiric structures throughout the basin indicate the presence of abundant halite. The largest of these are east of Lake Disappointment, where broad east-dipping synclines separated by sheared anticlinal crests suggest major westward expulsion of evaporites. Salt walls, above older Proterozoic sutures, are present in a zone along the southern and western margin margin of the Musgrave Province.   Apak and Moors (2000a,b) recognized six parasequence sets, separated by flooding surfaces, in the Browne Formation in the Yowalga area. These consist of varying mixtures of shale, siltstone, dolomite, halite and anhydrite, with proportions of each component varying both between parasequence sets and between holes. The dolomite is commonly silty, and the proportion of evaporites may increase upwards. Re-examination of the core in Empress 1A revealed metre-scale cyclicity, interpreted by Grey et al. (2005) as reflecting repeated shallowing-upward episodes.","The Browne Formation contains abundant evaporites, and was deposited in a strongly evaporitic restricted marine, peritidal to intertidal or lagoonal environments with strong oxidizing influences. Substantial dunefields were present towards the basin margin, evidenced by the thick eolian interval in Lancer 1. From the core in Empress 1A and Lancer 1, there is no indication of any deep-water environments.",275,4000,,"In outcrop, the Browne Formation has been recognized only in diapir cores, where most contacts are intrusive. The contact between the Browne Formation and the underlying Lefroy Formation or Townsend Quartzite has not been unequivocally identified anywhere. The lower horizons of the Browne Formation presumably grade laterally into the Lefroy Formation. Most drillholes that intersect the Browne Formation bottom within it. Where a lower contact is present, as in Kanpa 1A, Empress 1A, and Lancer 1, the lower part of the formation is absent.  The Browne Formation is angularly unconformable on sandstones older than the Townsend Quartzite. It is transitional upwards into the Hussar Formation. Along the Warri Ridge, it may be transitional into the Bitter Springs Formation, the equivalent lithostratigraphic unit in the Amadeus Basin.  ",,17,,,,4,,,,850,,720,,"From stromatolite and acritarch biostratigraphy and secular-isotope curves (Hill et al., 2000a,b; Hill and Walter, 2000; Walter et al., 2000), the Browne Formation can be correlated with the Bitter Springs Formation of the Amadeus Basin and the Coominaree Dolomite in the Callanna Group of the Adelaide Rift Complex. The Coominaree Dolomite underlies the Rook Tuff, which has a concordant U-Pb date of 802 Â± 10 Ma on single zircon grains (Fanning et al., 1986). The dolomite is older than the Wooltana Volcanics and the correlative Cadlareena Volcanic Swarm and Beda Volcanics, the extrusive equivalents of the 'Gairdner Dyke Swarm' (Preiss, 2000). The Browne Formation is therefore inferred to be older than about 800 Ma, and possibly older than about 827 Ma &mdash; the age of the 'Gairdner Dyke Swarm' )now Gairdner Dolerite.  Stromatolite biostratigraphy indicates that the Browne Formation can be correlated with at least part of the Skates Hills Formation of the northwestern Offi cer Basin, the Bitter Springs Formation of the Amadeus Basin, the Coominaree Dolomite of the Adelaide Rift Complex, and the Yackah beds of the Georgina Basin (Grey, 1995a). This correlation is based on the presence of the  Acaciella australica  Stromatolite Assemblage. The key taxon,  Acaciella australica , has been identifi ed at Woolnough Hills, and at a depth of 2390 m in Yowalga 3.  A. australica  and  Basisphaera irregularis  are present between 1365 and 1386.3 m in Empress 1A, and  B. irregularis  has been found in outcrop in central COOPER.  Comparable palynomorph assemblages, and comparable variations in carbon and strontium isotope curves support correlation with the Bitter Sprinmgs Formation (particulalrly the Gillen Member) in the Northern Territory and the Alinya Formation in South Australia Grey et al., 2005; Cotter, 1997,1999; Grey and Cotter, 1996; Hill et al., 2000a,b; Hill and Walter, 2000; Walter et al., 2000). A distinct positive peak in the &delta; 13Ccarbonate in the lower of two carbonate units in Empress 1A matches one at the contact between the Gillen and Loves Creek Members in the Bitter Springs Formation of the Amadeus Basin. It is followed by a major negative spike in the overlying stromatolitic carbonate ( A. australica  Stromatolite Assemblage) that is consistent with a similar spike in the stromatolitic carbonate of the Loves Creek Member of the Bitter Springs Formation, and the Coominaree Dolomite of the northern Adelaide Rift Complex and lateral equivalent in the eastern Officer Basin. The same sections are characterized by extremely low 87Sr/86Sr ratios. Both carbon and strontium isotope patterns are consistent with the global isotope curves.

The Lefroy and Browne Formations are probably lateral equivalents. The Ilma Formation and Mason Conglomerate are included also, although their stratigraphic level within the group is uncertain. The group comprises siltstone, mudstone, sandstone (in part quartzite), dolomite (commonly stromatolitic), and halite and other evaporite minerals. In core, rocks of the group are commonly chocolate brown or light ferrous green, with pink and red-tinted evaporites. Evaporites have been intersected in drill holes, but are not known in outcrop. Halotectonics, due to thick evaporites in the lower Browne Formation, appear to be a major structural control, if not the dominant control, in the Officer Basin (Simeonova and Iasky, 2004).  The group is of Cryogenian age. If correlations between the Buldya Group and successions in the Amadeus Basin and Adelaide Rift Complex are correct (Grey et al., 2005), then deposition of the Buldya Group began before about 827 Ma, possibly as early as 850 Ma. Deposition continued beyond 725 Ma, which is the age of a detrital zircon in the upper Kanpa Formation.","The Buldya Group is known from drillhole and seismic data, scattered isolated outcrops on BENTLEY, COOPER, MADLEY, NEALE, ROBERT, TALBOT, THROSSELL, and WARRI, and possibly minor outcrops on MINIGWAL, RASON, WESTWOOD, WAIGEN, YOWALGA, and MASON 1:250 000 sheets. The most extensive outcrops are east of Lake Disappointment and in Constance Headland, where major cauliflower-like structures visible on satellite imagery are suggestive of large scale salt expulsion. The group underlies Phanerozoic rocks or Cenozoic cover throughout much of the southwestern Officer Basin, and was intersected in a series of petroleum and stratigraphic drillholes (Perincek, 1998) that include: Browne 1 and 2, Dragoon 1, Hussar 1, Kanpa 1A, Lungkarta 1, Yowalga 2 and 3; Bureau of Mineral Resources (BMR, now Geoscience Australia (GA)) drillholes Madley 1, Talbot 1, 3, and 4, Throssell 1, and Warri 20; GSWA Empress 1 and 1A, GSWA Lancer 1, and deep mineral drillholes Kennecott N1 1, WMC NJD 1, and 92 THAC 001. The stratigraphic relationships of parts of sections intersected in drillholes PNC EXP CA 5, 9, 13, and 15 (Perincek, 1998) remain uncertain. The base of the Pirrilyungka Formation in GSWA Vines 1 may correlate with the uppermost Steptoe Formation (Haines et al., 2008).  From sections in drillholes towards the western margin of the basin, it appears that the unit immediately above the basal contact becomes progressively younger towards the basin margin. The Townsend Quartzite, Lefroy, and lower Browne Formations are absent in Empress 1A and Lancer 1 (Grey et al., 2005). Stromatolites in outcrops along the western margin of the basin are characteristic of the Kanpa Formation, but it is difficult to determine whether there might be some older Buldya Group between the basement and the Kanpa Formation. Exposures mapped as Townsend Quartzite along the western margin are possibly an older Mesoproterozoic sandstone, or Hussar or Kanpa Formation. On the southern basin margin, the Ilma Formation may be part of the Buldya Group, but its position within the group relative to other formations is unknown. It contains stromatolites similar to those found in the Woolnough Member, but preservation is too poor for this to be determined with any certainty.  It is difficult to estimate the thickness of the group because of the poor outcrop, and because it is deeply eroded in places. The group is at least 4500 m thick as estimated from maximum observed thicknesses of individual formations, mainly in drillholes, but individual drilled sections range from about 1000 to more than 3000 m thickness.","The Buldya Group is named after Buldya Soak on RASON (Grey et al., 2005), and includes the Townsend Quartzite, and the Lefroy, Browne, Hussar, Kanpa, and Steptoe Formations. The Ilma Formation, Mason Conglomerate, and an unnamed sandstone formerly assigned to the Lungkarta Formation, are here tentatively assigned to the Buldya Group solely on the basis of lithology, but their position within the group is uncertain. The Lefroy Formation is probably a lateral equivalent of the lower Browne Formation. The succession included in the Buldya Group has commonly been referred to as  Supersequence 1  (Walter et al., 1995).  For simplicity, the Buldya Group is informally divided into the lower Buldya Group (Townsend Quartzite, Lefroy Formation, and Browne Formation) and the upper Buldya Group (Hussar, Kanpa, and Steptoe Formations). These divisions represent significant changes in sedimentary character, but do not by themselves indicate major breaks in the succession. An unequivocal contact between the Browne Formation and Lefroy Formation or the Townsend Quartzite has not been observed, so the relationship between these units is inferred. Southgate (1991) recognized a disconformity between the lower and upper Bitter Springs Formation in the eastern Amadeus Basin, but this has not been observed in the correlative Browne Formation.",,"The Buldya Group comprises siltstone, mudstone, sandstone (in part quartzite), dolomite (commonly stromatolitic), and halite and other evaporite minerals. In core, rocks of the group are commonly chocolate brown or light ferrous green, with pink and red-tinted evaporites.","The Buldya Group was deposited in in continental to nearshore marine conditions, commonly evaporitic and, in places, eolian. The preserved lithofacies suggest an arid climate.",1000,4500,,,,17,,,Mixed,2,,,,1000,,720,,"The age of the Buldya Group as a whole is poorly constrained. It is generally regarded as Cryogenian, with a maximum age of about 850 Ma (Grey et al., 2005), but it is possible the Townsend Quartzite and lower Browne Formation are aproximately 150 million years older. This is based on the absence of a clear unconformable contact between the correlative Heavitree and Dean Quartzites (Amadeus Basin) with the underlying Tjauwata Group at some localities, and the presence of an unconformity within the Bitter Springs Formation (Browne Formation correlative) in parts of the Amadeus Basin. The age of the uppermost Buldya Group is also uncertain, as the upper Steptoe Formation is recognised solely on seismic images except perhaps in Vines 1, where the section below 1600 m is probably Steptoe Formation based on the presence of  Cerebrosphaera buickii,  and possibly conformable with the Pirrilyungka Formation (Sturtian glaciation) above.",No,,,1,b,No,PM Approved,Yes,Yes,P_,BU,,,,,MIRSGSW,2.02E+13,,Yes,No

The formation is located in the core of the Big Blow Anticline on the southern KALGOORLIE and northern YILMIA map sheets. The basaltic rocks show a range of textures including pillowed, microporphyritic to aphantic and includes the plagioclase-phyric Little Blow Member. Small, historic gold prospects are generally associated with felsic intrusives of the Bayleys Porphyry within the Burbanks Formation.","The Burbanks Formation is exposed in the core of the Big Blow Anticline anticline on the southern KALGOORLIE and northern YILMIA map sheets. The formation extends for 13 km in a narrow north-northeasting trending belt, south of Coolgardie Township.","The source of the name for the Burbanks Formation is thought to be associated with a prospector by the same name. Mr Burbanks was the discoverer of Burbanks Birthday Gift prospect, located 9.1 km south-southwest of Coolgardie.",,"The Burbanks Formation is predominantly metamorphosed basalt, but also includes rare, very thin (<5m) silicified metasedimentary facies and ultramafic facies. Lower amphibolite facies grade metamorphism and solid state deformation fabrics strongly overprint most primary features, particularly facing direction in pillowed units. Contact between flows is difficult to find, but where contacts have been identified it is generally gradational. No brecciated flow tops were positively identified. Cross cutting veins are primarily carbonate-dominant, but quartz veining is also known to occur.  The metabasaltic rocks vary from amygdaloidal, pillowed, vesicular, porphyritic to aphanitic. Vesicular, to microporphyritic flows are most common in the lower half of the formation intercalated with the more dominant massive flows. The microporphyritic units are generally only few metres thick and are difficult to trace along strike. Within these microporphyritic flows feldspar phenocryst size gradually decreases, graduating into a massive basalt. Plagioclase and hornblende are the dominant minerals, with 1-3% magnetite. Plagioclase is commonly seritized, but maximum extinction angle of albite twins indicate an An27-An33 range.   At the top of the lower third of the formation, a very thin (<3m) wide tremolite-rich schist after an ultramafic (GSWA 204547; 23.4 wt% MgO, 45.0% SiO 2 ) is in sharp contact with a sheared to massive metabasalt to metakomatiitic basalt (e.g. MGA zone 51, 318598E, 6560162N). The schist can be trace up to 100 along strike, but commonly pinches out. At MGA zone 51 320829E, 6563904N, a similar tremolite-schist unit is in close association with a strongly deformed pillowed and porphyritic basaltic unit (MGA zone 51, 320818E, 6563892N). Asymmetrical feldspar augen and S-C solid state fabric indicate sinistral movement. Pillow basalt has also been identified in the underground workings at the Burbanks Mine site (pers. Comm. A. Pumphrey, 2010).  In the middle to upper third of the Formation a laterally continuous porphyric metabasalt has been formally named the Little Blow Member. The thickness varies considerably, but an average thickness is 150-200 metres. Standing (2001) reports the unit up to 500m thick. The feldspar phenocrysts are euhedral to subhedral, with an average size of 3-5mm, but can be up to 25 mm. The top of the basalt is in sharp contact with an aphantic basalt. The upper third of the unit is dominated by aphantic basalt with a tholeiitic composition. Solid state deformation fabrics are variable from weak to strong, particularly at the southern end of the Big Blow Anticline where there are a multiple shear zones and tight folding. The only known exposures of interflow sedimentary rocks in the Burbanks Formation are near, or at the top of the aphantic basalt unit. Thin carbonaceous to sulphidic shales can be found near the Lady Carmen to Perseverance prospects 3.2 km south-southeast of Coolgardie.  Geochemically, the basalts are tholeiitic with high TiO 2  (1.5 wt%, average) and anhydrous FeO total (13.53 wt%, average). Anhydrous MgO averages 5.6wt%, and all three elements plus Cr, and Ti/Zr ratio show distinctive trends that distinguish the Burbanks Formation from the younger Lindsays Basalt of the Coolgardie Subgroup. Rare earth element (REE) patterns show a flat REE-trend with a slight enrichment or depletion in Lanthanum. Mafic intrusive rocks within the Burbanks Formation are dolerite sills up to 30m wide. Felsic dykes or sills are rare and are limited to the pale-grey to cream coloured microporphyritic felsic Bayleys Porphyry. These sills are up to 5m wide and have a sharp or sheared contact with basaltic rocks. Shallow historical workings are often located on these felsic rocks and can be found at prospects such as Big Blow, Empress, Tartan and Burbanks Welcome. ","The presence of pillow basalts indicates a subaqueous, volcanic depositional environment.",,950,,The basal contact of the Burbanks Formation is not exposed in the core of the Big Blow Anticline.

The member is up to 1000 m thick and is conformably located between thick packages of Olympio Formation siliciclastic metasedimentary turbidite metasandstone and hemipelagic metasiltstone and metamudstone. The Butchers Gully Member is composed of meta-andesitic and metatrachytic lava flows, domes and sills (P_-HCob-mft), and volcaniclastic rocks. The latter have a metacarbonate-rich matrix. Chert and ferruginous chert is commonly interbedded with metavolcanic rocks. The Butchers Gully Member has been dated at 1846 Â± 4 Ma, which is interpreted as the age of volcanism.","The Butchers Gully Member of the Olympio Formation is exposed in three areas:  1. North-northeasterly trending outcrops in the Butchers Gully area from near the Ruby Queen Mine in the south (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 368733E 7959332N) to the Black Hills Yard area in the northeast (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 374724E 7979978N).  2. Thin, gently arcuate, north-northeasterly trending fault-bound exposures on HALLS CREEK between the Caroline Pool Fault to the east and Angelo Fault to the west. These outcrops parallel the Great Northern Highway (about 8 km the east) between the Duncan Road to the north and Tanami Road to the south.  3.

The member was redefined by Griffin and Tyler (1993) and renamed after exposures near Butchers Gully, a tributary of the Black Elvire River (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 374760E 7972876N).",,"The most extensive research on the Butchers Gully Member was carried out at the Brockman prospect, 7 km south of Old Halls Creek (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 373322E 7974524N; Buckovic, 1984; Esslemont, 1990; Taylor et al., 1995a,b). In this area, the Butchers Gully Member is composed of a series of volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks. Lava flows are commonly less than 5 m thick, vesicular and/or pillowed, often with columnar jointing. Pillows contain radiating pipe-vesicles, cooling cracks, and chilled-margins (Taylor et al., 1995a). Taylor et al. (1995a) noted that the Butchers Gully Member lavas fall into two compositional variants: leucocratic or mesocratic lavas. Leucocratic lavas are trachytic with a fine-grained microcrystalline texture and are commonly amygdaloidal. Amygdales can be filled with secondary limonite, calcite, biotite, quartz, and/or fluorite. Mesocratic lavas are trachytic, pillowed, or massive, with some scoriaceous tops and interflow breccia beds.  Intercalated with the volcanic rocks are poorly sorted, matrix-supported volcaniclastic breccias, some of which have been reworked into clast-supported variants. Volcaniclastic rocks grade from crystal-bearing in proximal-to-vent facies to pumiceous in relatively distal volcanic metasandstone. Clasts in matrix-supported breccias include probable volcanic bombs, volcanic rock fragments, and rounded quartz, possibly from nearby hydrothermal veins and pods, all in a schistose, fine-grained matrix. Breccia beds are poorly sorted with 50-60% of the clasts 0.5 to 5 cm across and 25 to 30% of clasts between 5 to 10 cm across and 10 to 20% exceeding 10 cm across (Taylor et al., 1995a).  Other volcaniclastic rocks include clast- and matrix-supported scoriaceous breccia beds adjacent to mesocratic lavas and carbonate-rich tuffs. Clasts of scoria and highly vesicular lava are commonly 1 to 15 cm across and angular to subrounded in a fine-grained matrix. Breccia beds have normal grading and are better sorted towards the tops of beds. Amygdales are filled with secondary carbonate and quartz. Clast-supported pillow breccias with 10 to 30 cm randomly-oriented clasts and hyaloclastite breccias can be traced to subvolcanic feeder dykes. These breccia beds have a carbonate-cemented matrix.  Tuffaceous volcaniclastic rocks are found interbedded with lavas. They are commonly schistose, micaceous, and composed of 1 to 2 mm flattened grains of quartz, iron-oxides (possibly after pyroxene or titanomagnetite), and altered feldspar. Lapilli-sized (0.5 - 1.5 cm) quartz, kaolinitized feldspar, or lithic fragments are less common. This lithofacies grades into volcaniclastic metasandstone away from vent facies.  Mesocratic and equigranular, 1 to 150 m-thick subvolcanic sills and dykes intrude the lavas. At the Brockman prospect (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 373322E 7974524N) sills and dykes crosscut volcaniclastic units and trachyte pillow lavas. Amygdales are filled by chlorite, biotite, feldspar, limonite, quartz, or carbonate.","The Butchers Gully Member of the Olympio Formation represents submarine volcanism on the margin of the North Australian Craton at c. 1846 Ma. Volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks are intercalated with turbiditic metasedimentary units of the Olympio Formation (P_-HCo-xmt-ml). Matrix-supported breccia beds were probably deposited coeval with lavas. Normal grading found in some breccia beds could represent a change in eruption style from initial fire-fountaining to Strombolian-type activity (Cas and Wright, 1987; Taylor et al., 1995a). It could also be the result of sorting and density stratification within a subaqueously deposited mass flow possibly as debrites on volcano flanks (Taylor et al., 1995a).",,1000,,"The metavolcanic and metavolcaniclastic Butchers Gully Member conformably overlies and is conformably overlain by Olympio Formation metasedimentary units (P_-HCo-xmt-ml and P_-HCo-mt).

It is also recorded from outcrops west of Irregully Creek on ULLAWARRA, in small outliers at Mount Dawson, and south of Bywash Bore on CAPRICORN. The formation unconformably overlies the Ashburton Formation (Wyloo Group) and is conformably overlain by the Mooline Formation of the Capricorn Group. The Bywash Formation is composed of thinly to very thickly bedded, lithic quartz sandstone and dolomitic sandstone, together with minor siltstone and dolomitic siltstone, dolostone, conglomerate, and felsic volcaniclastic rock (including the Koonong Member). The formation is interpreted as an assemblage of braided-fluvial and shallow-marine (or lacustrine) deposits that were laid down between c. 1799 and 1738 Ma.","The Bywash Formation outcrops on CAPRICORN, ULLAWARRA, and ASHBURTON, with the best exposures located in the Capricorn Range (Zone 50, MGA 472000E 7422000N), west of Irregully Creek (Zone 50, MGA 449000E 7424000N), in small outliers at Mount Dawson (Zone 50, MGA 453000E 7439500N), and south of Bywash Bore (Zone 50, MGA 458800E 7434500N). The formation has an estimated thickness range of 400-550 m.","The Bywash Formation was established by Martin et al. (2005) as a result of their 1:100 000 mapping on the EDMUND 1:250 000 map sheet. It forms the lower part of the Capricorn Group and is named after Bywash Bore (Zone 50, MGA 458800E 7434500N) on northwest CAPRICORN. The Bywash Formation is well exposed in the type section for the Capricorn Group in Stockyard Creek (Zone 50, MGA 487550E 7413550N).",,"The Bywash Formation is composed of thinly to very thickly bedded, lithic quartz sandstone and dolomitic sandstone, together with minor siltstone and dolomitic siltstone, dolostone, conglomerate, and felsic volcanic rock. A prominent felsic volcanic unit, the Koonong Member (P_-CPbk-fn) occurs at the top of the formation in the Capricorn Range and a siltstone-dominated member (P_-CPb-sl) outcrops over a small area in the western Capricorn Range, south of Corner Bore (Zone 50, MGA 470000E 7429500N). The Bywash Formation is generally resistant to weathering and erosion, and outcrops as series of prominent ridges and low hills.   Lithic quartz sandstones and dolomitic sandstones are fine- to very coarse-grained, thinly to very thickly bedded, and are commonly ferruginous and micaceous. A prominent 1.5 - 4 m thick, trough cross-stratified quartz sandstone unit forms the base of the formation in the central Capricorn Range (Zone 50, MGA 492030E 7418650N) and records a northeasterly directed paleoflow. The overlying dolomitic sandstones and lithic sandstones display a range of sedimentary structures that include parallel stratification, trough and tabular cross-stratification, ripple cross-lamination, sole markings (including flute marks), and ball-and-pillow structures. In addition, many sandstones show normal grading, and symmetrical straight-crested ripples are preserved on the tops of some beds. Most of the sandstones are poorly to moderately sorted lithic quartz arenites and wackes. Lithic clasts form up to 10% of the rock and include siltstone, very fine grained quartzite, chert, phyllite, and rare fine-grained quartz-tourmaline composites. The main accessory minerals are often concentrated within specific laminae and include opaque minerals, sericite, feldspar, tourmaline, and zircon. Alignment of sericite may also form a distinct foliation throughout the rock (Martin et al., 2005).  Siltstone and dolomitic siltstone form recessive layers, ranging in thickness from a few centimetres to several metres, between the main sandstone units. They are commonly ferruginous and micaceous and generally display parallel-planar lamination or ripple cross-lamination. The internal structure of the siltstone beds may be deformed as a result of loading by the overlying sandstones.  Lenticular beds of clast- and matrix-supported, pebble- to cobble-conglomerate are present locally and are generally confined to the base of the Bywash Formation. They are massive to weakly stratified and are mostly composed of well-rounded clasts set in a sandy matrix. Principal clast types are silicified quartz sandstone and massive or banded chert, together with minor quartz-feldspar porphyry, siltstone, and jaspilite.  Dolostones are strongly recrystallized and form thin, discontinuous units within the siliciclastic succession. Most beds are either massive or irregularly stratified, whereas others preserve small-scale columnar stromatolites.  Apart from the Koonong Member, most felsic volcanic layers are thin (<1 m) and discontinuous. They are composed of massive or laminated, recrystallized, felsic volcaniclastic sandstone.","Thorne and Seymour (1991) interpret the lower part of the Capricorn Group, including the Bywash Formation as an assemblage of braided-fluvial and shallow marine (or lacustrine) deposits. They were deposited in a rapidly subsiding basin located to the north of a tectonically active upland area that occupied the central part of the Capricorn Orogen.",,550,,The Bywash Formation unconformably overlies the Ashburton Formation (Wyloo Group) and is conformably overlain by the Mooline Formation of the Capricorn Group.,,17,,,,4,,,,1799,,1738,,"The Bywash Formation was probably deposited between c. 1799 and 1738 Ma; however, the geochronological data relating to its precise depositional age are uncertain.

(2017a,b) reported dates of 1800 Â± 7 Ma and 1801 Â± 6 Ma from accretionary lapilli tuffs of the Koonong Member at the top of the Bywash Formation. These dates are all within uncertainty of the 1799 Â± 8 Ma and 1806 Â± 9 Ma dates obtained from the June Hill Volcanics (Evans et al., 2003) and Ashburton Formation felsic volcanic rocks (GSWA 148922, Nelson, 2005), respectively, in the unconformably underlying Wyloo Group. The youngest age component of detrital zircons in a lithic sandstone from the Mooline Formation toward the top of the group indicates this unit has a maximum depositional age of 1801 Â± 14 Ma (GSWA 148925, Nelson, 2005), although the youngest zircon is 1800 Â± 14 Ma (1&sigma;). Considering that the age of felsic volcanic rocks in both the Wyloo and Capricorn Groups are within uncertainty of each other, the best estimate for the maximum age of deposition of the Capricorn Group is taken to be the age youngest deformed rock in the underlying Wyloo Group, at c. 1799 Ma (Evans et al., 2003).  A conservative younger age limit for the Bywash Formation is fixed by the c. 1738 Ma age of gold mineralization at the Mount Olympus deposit (Sener et al., 2005) that post-dates the D 2n  event responsible for much of the deformation in the Capricorn Group.",No,,,2,,No,Published,No,No,P_,CPb,,,,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

Elsewhere it is unconformably overlain by the ?Late Mesoproterozoic Salvation Group or the Neoproterozoic Sunbeam Group (Officer Basin) along the eastern margin of the Collier Basin. Thickness variations and paleocurrent data suggest the delta complex built out from a source area to the south and east, near CALYIE and JAMINDI, and prograded to the north and west, at least as far as ELLIOTT CREEK. The depositional age of the Calyie Formation is poorly constrained, but is probably between c. 1171 and 1067 Ma.","The Calyie Formation (P_-MCc-st) outcrops around the core of the Wanna Syncline between ELLIOTT CREEK and TEANO and extends north of the Mount Vernon Fault on MOUNT VERNON and TANGADEE. It is also exposed in the Calyie and Cherry Synclines on CALYIE and CARDAWAN, on adjacent parts of JAMINDI and MILGUN, in the Collier Range Syncline, and around the northeastern closure of the Mindi Syncline on CARDAWAN. The unit is also present north of the Lofty Range Syncline on LOFTY RANGE and ILGARARI, south of the Lofty Range Fault, on the southeastern part of LOFTY RANGE, the adjacent part of ILGARARI, in the Jaydinia Syncline, on a wide area of northern WONYULGUNNA, extending to the north on ILGARARI between the Bujundunna East and Snell Well Faults, and around the Nuninga Spring North Fault.   The formation generally ranges in thickness from 100 to 300 m in the Wanna Syncline and Mount Vernon Fault area, but thickens to about 1100 m around the eastern closure of the Calyie Syncline on CARDAWAN. It is 1500-1800 m thick in the Calyie Syncline, Jamindi Anticline, and Thompson Fault area on CALYIE, JAMINDI, and THREE RIVERS. It is 500700 m thick in the Jaydinia Syncline on WONYULGUNNA, generally 6001000 m thick in the Lofty Range Syncline on LOFTY RANGE and ILGARARI, but thickens to about 1900 m on the southern flank of the syncline around the Butcher Bird Fault area on ILGARARI and the northeastern extension of the Collier Range Syncline on WONYULGUNNA.","The Calyie Formation was originally mapped on the 1:250 000 map sheet EDMUND as the Kurabuka Formation (Daniels, 1966). Subsequently the basal sandstone was separated from the Kurabuka Formation and named the Mount Vernon Sandstone of the Mucalana Subgroup by Brakel and Muhling (1976). At the same time an equivalent unit, the Calyie Sandstone, was defined in the eastern facies of the Bangemall Group (Brakel and Muhling, 1976; Muhling and Brakel, 1985). The Mucalana Subgroup was abandoned by Cooper et al. (1998) and the constituent formations renamed and incorporated into the Collier Subgroup. This resulted in the name Calyie Sandstone being extended throughout the 'Bangemall Basin'. The Calyie Sandstone was later renamed the Calyie Formation by Martin et al. (1999) to take into account its lithological variation. This nomenclature was subsequently used by Martin and Thorne (2002) and Martin et al. (2005).  The formation name was derived from the Calyie Hills (Zone 50, MGA 668700E 7251900N), 19 km east of Mulgul Homestead on MULGUL (Muhling and Brakel, 1985). The type section for the Calyie Formation is at the gap in the Calyie Hills and Flat Top Range at Mingah Spring (Zone 50, MGA 674350E 7247100N), 7 km north of Mingah Springs Homestead on CALYIE (Muhling and Brakel, 1985). A reference section through the Calyie Formation in the western Edmund Basin has been measured at Gregorys Gap (Zone 50, MGA 490100E 7352000N) along the east bank of Koorabooka Creek on ELLIOTT CREEK (Martin and Thorne, 2002).",,"The Calyie Formation consists of thinly to very thickly bedded quartz sandstone and subordinate siltstone, together with minor conglomerate. More significant occurrences of siltstone, siltstone and sandstone, and sandstone and siltstone have been mapped as separate members (P_-MCc-sl, P_-MCc-sf, and P_-MCc-ss). The sandstone units are commonly silicified and resistant and form prominent strike ridges and flat-topped hills and plateaus. On CARDAWAN the sandstones are cut by 1-3 mm-wide, fine-grained quartz veinlets that are typically developed parallel to subvertical joints or bedding planes.  Thin- to medium-bedded sandstones are mostly fine- to coarse-grained and are either massive or else display parallel-planar lamination, ripple cross-lamination, or small-scale trough or planar tabular cross-stratification. Primary current lineation, flutes, and current ripple bedforms are observed on some bedding surfaces. Medium- to very thickly bedded, medium- to very coarse-grained sandstones can be subdivided into two main lithofacies: massive to weakly stratified sandstone and cross-stratified sandstone.  Many beds of massive to weakly stratified sandstone show little internal structure other than a bedding-parallel alignment of mudstone pebble intraclasts or a faint parallel-lamination in upper parts of the bed. Others show well-developed dish structures and irregular vertical dewatering sheets and pipes, and cross-stratification in the upper parts of some beds. Flutes are preserved on some lower bedding surfaces, whereas symmetrical megaripples have been recorded from the top surfaces (Chuck, 1984). Cross-stratified sandstones are lenticular bedded and display a variety of stratification types, ranging from low- to high-angle trough cross-stratification, planar tabular cross-stratification, undulatory stratification, and hummocky cross-stratification. Many beds contain disseminated mudstone rip-ups, detrital glauconite, fine-grained sandstone intraclast pebble lags, and cubic moulds after pyrite. Symmetrical, straight-crested ripples and megaripples are preserved on the tops of some beds. Martin et al. (2005) note that localized mud cracks and possible gypsum casts and pseudomorphs provide evidence for subaerial exposure. Paleocurrent data from cross-stratified sandstones are variable with opposed trends often being recorded from different parts of the same outcrop. In the Wanna Syncline and north of the Mount Vernon Fault two major components are recorded, one towards the sector between southwest and northwest and the other towards the sector between northeast and southeast. Farther to the southeast on JAMINDI and THREE RIVERS, the paleocurrent directions are generally towards the east and northeast.  Most of the sandstones in the Calyie Formation are poorly to well-sorted, well-rounded, medium- to coarse-grained quartz arenites (Martin et al., 2005). Grain compositions are dominated by monocrystalline quartz, minor polycrystalline quartz, and chert/microquartz with trace amounts of iron oxide and mica after labile grains and well-rounded zircon and tourmaline. The amount of feldspar is generally low, although Muhling and Brakel (1985) record values of up to 5%. The matrix consists of syntaxial quartz cement and dusty hematite. Large cubic voids after weathered pyrite are locally abundant.  ","The sandstone-dominated lithofacies that characterize the Calyie Formation were probably deposited in a delta front to delta top depositional environment. Massive to weakly stratified sandstones are thought to have been deposited from storm-generated, high- and low-density sediment gravity flows, in a below wave base setting. Here, they were subject to rapid dewatering and largely protected from reworking by background wave and bottom current processes. Cross-stratified sandstones display a variety of traction and wave-generated structures. They are most likely to have been laid down in a shallower delta front setting where there was a greater interplay of fluvial and shallow marine processes. This interplay is also reflected in the opposing paleocurrent directions recorded by many of these cross-stratified units. The presence of desiccation cracks and evidence for intraformational reworking also suggests there was some subaerial exposure (Martin et al., 2005). The deltaic sandstone succession thickens from around 200-300 m in the north and northwestern parts of the basin between TANGADEE and ELLIOTT CREEK to 1000-1900 m in the southeast on CARDAWAN, CALYIE, JAMINDI, and THREE RIVERS. This, combined with the paleocurrent data, suggests the delta complex built out from the south and southeast and prograded to the northwest and west.",,1900,,"The basal contact of the Calyie Formation with the Backdoor Formation is conformable and gradational. It either has a conformable upper contact with the Ilgarari Formation.

The older age limit is provided by structural relationships that suggest that the formation was not affected by the 1321-1171 Ma Mutherbukin Tectonic Event (Korhonen et al., 2017). The younger age limit for the group comes from mafic sills of the 1084-1067 Ma Kulkatharra Dolerite, part of the c. 1075 Ma Warakurna Large Igneous Province (Wingate 2002, Wingate et al., 2004), which intrude the succession. Martin (2003) recorded the presence of a peperite margin along the contact between a mafic sill of Kulkatharra Dolerite and lithic quartz wacke of the Backdoor Formation on KENNETH RANGE. This suggests that, locally, the Kulkatharra Dolerite may have been intruded into unlithified or semilithified sediment relatively close to the younger age limit of c. 1067 Ma.  The youngest group of detrital zircons in a sample (GSWA 152968; Martin et al., 2008) collected from a sandstone outcropping near the top of the Calyie Formation in Gregorys Gap on ELLIOTT CREEK (Zone 50, MGA 490439E 7352318N) is dominated by Proterozoic ages with a weighted mean age of 1740 Â± 18 Ma. However, these authors note that only 18 analyses have suitable concordance, which greatly reduces the statistical adequacy of the sample.

The Camel Hills Metamorphics were deformed and metamorphosed during both the 2005-1950 Ma Glenburgh Orogeny and 1820-1770 Ma Capricorn Orogeny. The Camel Hills Metamorphics are subdivided into the Quartpot Pelite (P_-CHq-mln), the Petter Calc-silicate (P_-CHp-mk and P_-CHp-xmtq-mkq), and undivided units of metamorphosed banded iron-formation (P_-CH-mi) and amphibolite (P_-CH-mwa). The Quartpot Pelite consists of pelitic diatexite and psammitic schist or gneiss interlayered with minor quartzite, calc-silicate gneiss, and amphibolite, and the Petter Calc-silicate is composed of calc-silicate schist or gneiss with minor quartzite. The calc-silicate rock (P_-CHp-mk) is commonly interlayered with the amphibolite (P_-CH-mwa). The Quartpot Pelite was sourced from a currently unexposed Paleoproterozoic Terrane with an age of 2095-2000 Ma, during the earliest event (D 1g ) of the Glenburgh Orogeny. The Petter Calc-silicate was sourced directly from the Yilgarn Craton sometime between c. 2608 and c. 1944 Ma, and possibly deposited as a  calc-rich  passive margin to the Yilgarn Craton.","Medium- to high-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Camel Hills Metamorphics outcrop in the Errabiddy Shear Zone, on ERRABIDDY, LANDOR, YALBRA, and ERONG. The fault-bounded units generally have a strike length of more than 100 km, with cross-strike widths of a few km, although on ERRABIDDY the package of folded metasediments reaches 10 km or more.","Metasedimentary rocks of the Camel Hills Metamorphics were previously included within the Morrissey Metamorphic Suite (Williams et al., 1983a; Williams, 1986), the name given for a suite of metamorphosed and deformed Proterozoic sedimentary rocks thought to outcrop throughout the Gascoyne Province (Williams et al., 1983b). The suite was considered to be equivalent, in part, to sedimentary rocks of the Wyloo Group to the north, and sedimentary rocks of the Yerrida and Bryah Groups (Pirajno et al., 1998) to the east. However, there is no certainty that all the metasedimentary rocks throughout the Gascoyne Province were deposited in the same sedimentary basin or are the same age. The Camel Hills Metamorphics on ERRABIDDY and LANDOR are separated from the Morrissey Metamorphic Suite, as defined on the MOUNT PHILLIPS 1:250 000 sheet (Williams et al., 1983b), by large areas of granitic gneiss, supracrustal metasedimentary and mafic meta-igneous rocks, and large fault structures.

These include two samples of pelitic diatexite migmatite and a psammitic gneiss from the Quartpot Pelite, and one sample of calc-silicate gneiss from the Petter Calc-silicate.  All three samples from the Quartpot Pelite (GSWA 142905, 142910, 168944; Nelson, 1998, 1999a, 2001) are dominated by detrital zircons with  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* dates in the range 2095-1985 Ma, and this age component is defined by >55% of the dated zircons (68 of 119 analyses). The samples also contain two distinct age components, at c. 2250 and c. 2175 Ma, and individual zircons as old as c. 2890 Ma (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011). Calculated zircon crystallinity suggests that the range of zircon dates between c. 2095 and c. 1985 Ma in all three samples reflects the true ages of the zircons and does not result from variable loss of radiogenic Pb (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011). Significant age components for the combined data from all three samples can be resolved at c. 2080, c. 2075, c. 2065, c. 2050, c. 2030, c. 2025, and c. 2000 Ma, and reflect derivation from a source or sources of different ages (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011). The youngest age component, at 2001 Â± 26 Ma, is interpreted as a maximum age of deposition of the sedimentary protolith.  Two samples (GSWA 142905 and 142910) contain high-U, low Th/U structureless zircon rims that are interpreted to have grown during high grade D 2g  metamorphism (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011). These rims yielded dates of 1952 Â± 14 Ma (GSWA 142905) and 1955 Â± 7 Ma (GSWA 142910) indicating that the Quartpot Pelite was deposited between c. 2000 and c. 1960 Ma, an age that overlaps with the earliest deformation and metamorphism associated with the Glenburgh Orogeny, i.e., D 1g  (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011). Currently there are no known rocks in the Gascoyne Province with ages between c. 2080 and c. 2005 Ma and therefore the source of these abundant detrital zircons is unknown. However, it is possible that there are older, currently unexposed parts of the Dalgaringa arc (proto-Dalgaringa arc) that may have been uplifted and eroded during the D 1g  event of the Glenburgh Orogeny to source the Quartpot Pelite.  The single sample of Petter Calc-silicate (GSWA 142908; Nelson, 1999b) contains an entirely different detrital zircon age spectrum to that of the Quartpot Pelite. This sample contains only Archean detritus, including the youngest detrital zircon component at c. 2610 Ma, suggesting that it was either deposited in the late Archean or that its detritus was sourced entirely from Archean rocks. The sample contains two minor age components, at 2660-2650 Ma and c. 2690 Ma, and also contains a few individual zircons in the 3150-3030 Ma age range. A single metamorphic rim dated at c. 1945 Ma provides a younger limit for its deposition, setting wide time constraints between c. 2610 and c. 1945 Ma. A statistical comparison of the detrital zircon age modes within the Petter Calc-silicate sample with those of representative granitic samples along the northern part of the Yilgarn Craton, including the Yarlarweelor Gneiss Complex, provide a good correlation (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011), suggesting that the Petter Calc-silicate was sourced directly from the Yilgarn Craton. Although the Petter Calc-silicate is currently tectonically interleaved with the Quartpot Pelite, its detrital zircon components clearly indicate that the two formations were deposited in different, widely separated basins. Considering the sole Archean detritus and Yilgarn Craton-like source for the Petter Calc-silicate, it is still possible that the sediment was deposited in a similar time frame to that of the Quartpot Pelite, albeit on a different cratonic margin. Dating of detrital zircons from other samples of the Petter Calc-silicate would help to resolve this issue.",No,,,21,,No,Published,Yes,Yes,P_,CH,,13,22,a,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,No,No

The Capricorn Group unconformably overlies the Ashburton Formation (Wyloo Group) and is unconformably overlain by either the Bresnahan Group or the Edmund Group. It is a mixed siliciclastic, carbonate, and felsic volcanic succession, made up of the Bywash (lower) and Mooline (upper) Formations. This stratigraphy comprises braided fluvial to shallow-marine or lacustrine sedimentary rocks that were deposited in a rapidly subsiding basin. The age of the Capricorn Group is poorly constrained and was probably deposited between c. 1799 and 1738 Ma.","The most extensive outcrops of the Capricorn Group are in the Capricorn Range (Zone 50, MGA 480700E 7418000N) on CAPRICORN and ASHBURTON. These rocks are also present as smaller exposures west of Irregully Creek (Zone 50, MGA 450000E 7424000N) and at Mount Dawson (Zone 50, MGA 453000E 7439500N) on CAPRICORN, at Mount Boggola (Zone 50, MGA 569900E 7367600N), and in fault-bounded outcrops around Mount Elephant (MGA Zone 50, 561800E 7396300N) on BOGGOLA and ASHBURTON. Isolated outcrops of Capricorn Group are also recorded south of Turee Creek Homestead (around Zone 50, MGA 672200E 7380200N and Zone 50, MGA 654800E 7375400N) on KUNDERONG.  The Capricorn Group has an estimated maximum thickness of about 1500 m in the eastern Capricorn Range on CAPRICORN, although this estimate is made difficult by the faulted nature of the upper part of the section and the fact that the top of the Capricorn Group is not exposed. In the western Capricorn Range, a thickness estimate based on more-limited dip information suggests the group has a minimum thickness of about 2500-3000 m in the area east of Irregully Creek (around Zone 50, MGA 464628E 7419600N). These thickness estimates are considerably more than the 800 m figure suggested by Thorne and Seymour (1991), but are less than the 6000 m value quoted by Barnes (1998).","Rocks assigned to the Capricorn Group were initially included within the Wyloo Group (Horwitz, 1980; Seymour et al., 1988). Subsequently, Thorne (1990) and Thorne and Seymour (1991) regarded these rocks as a separate, younger formation because of a marked angular unconformity that separates them from the underlying Ashburton Formation. The Capricorn Formation was then raised to group level by Martin et al. (2005) based on the recognition of two lithostratigraphic units, the lower Bywash Formation and the upper Mooline Formation. An additional named stratigraphic unit, the Koonong Member has been identified at the top of the Bywash Formation.   The type section for the Capricorn Group is the same as that proposed for the Capricorn Formation by Thorne and Seymour (1991) and is exposed along a northward-draining creek that cuts the basal unconformity northeast of Stockyard Creek (Zone 50, MGA 493160E 7412160N).",,"The Capricorn Group is composed of a mixed assemblage of siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks, interbedded with minor felsic volcanic deposits. It is subdivided into two formations, the Bywash Formation and the Mooline Formation.  The Bywash Formation is composed of thinly to very thickly bedded, lithic quartz sandstone and dolomitic sandstone, together with minor siltstone and dolomitic siltstone, dolostone, conglomerate, and felsic volcaniclastic rock. A prominent felsic volcaniclastic unit, the Koonong Member (P_-CPbk-fn), is located at the top of the formation in the Capricorn Range, and a siltstone-dominated member (P_-CPb-sl) outcrops over a small area in the western Capricorn Range, south of Corner Bore (MGA Zone 50, 470000E 7429500N).  The Mooline Formation is composed of fine- to very coarse-grained sandstone, siltstone, conglomerate, dolostone, dolomitic siltstone, and felsic volcaniclastic sandstone. More-significant thicknesses of siltstone and sandstone, mixed dolostone and sandstone, and conglomerate have been mapped as separate members (P_-CPm-sf, P_-CPm-kt, P_-CPm-sc).","Lower and middle parts of the Capricorn Group, including the Bywash Formation and much of the Mooline Formation are interpreted as an assemblage of braided-fluvial and shallow-marine (or lacustrine) deposits (Thorne and Seymour, 1991). They were laid down in a rapidly subsiding basin, located to the north of a tectonically active upland area that occupied the central part of the Capricorn Orogen. This pattern of sedimentation was accompanied by brief periods of felsic volcanism, the most significant of which resulted in the deposition of the Koonong Member (P_-CPbk-fn). In the latter stages of the basin's evolution, source area uplift was accompanied by braided fluvial progradation. Finally, localized proximal fan-delta deposits, containing a high proportion of carbonate and felsic volcaniclastic material were introduced from the south.",,3000,,The Capricorn Group unconformably overlies the Ashburton Formation (Wyloo Group) and is unconformably overlain by either the Bresnahan Group or the Edmund Group.,,17,,,,2,,,,1799,,1738,,"The Capricorn Group was probably deposited between c. 1799 and 1738 Ma.

Considering that the age of felsic volcanic rocks in both the Wyloo and Capricorn Groups are within uncertainty of each other, the best estimate for the maximum age of deposition of the Capricorn Group is taken to be the age youngest deformed rock in the underlying Wyloo Group, at c. 1799 Ma (Evans et al., 2003).  A conservative younger age limit for the Bywash Formation is fixed by the c. 1738 Ma age of gold mineralization at the Mount Olympus deposit (Sener et al., 2005) that post-dates the D 2n  event responsible for much of the deformation in the Capricorn Group.",No,,,288,,No,Published,Yes,Yes,P_,CP,,13,14,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

It locally reaches an estimated thickness of 3400 m in a depocentres west of the Sir Frederick Ranges (southeastern MACDONALD 1:250 000 map sheet), but is mostly less than 2000 m thick, thinning to the north (Haines et al., 2012). The unit conformably overlies the Ediacaran Julie Formation in the north, and unconformably overlies older units such as the Tonian Bitter Springs Group in the south. The Carnegie Formation is of deltaic to fluvial origin, inferred to have been deposited during an early stage of the 580-520 Ma Petermann Orogeny, largely during the late Ediacaran, but may extend into the early Cambrian (Haines et al., 2012, 2015, 2016). It represents the local base of Supersequence 4 of the Centralian Superbasin (Supersequence terminology of Walter et al., 1995). Problematic organic remains such as  Arumberia , also known from the Arumbera Sandstone of the northeastern Amadeus Basin, are locally common (Haines et al., 2012, 2015).  ","The Carnegie Formation is widespread across the WA Amadeus Basin (MACDONALD, northern RAWLINSON, eastern RYAN 1:250 000 scale map sheet areas), but the only outcrops currently mapped in the Northern Territory (NT) are in the western part of the southern MOUNT RENNIE 1:250 000 map sheet area.","The Carnegie Formation was defined by Well et al. (1961, 1964) and was named after Carnegie Range (RAWLINSON 1:250 000 map sheet). According to Wells et al. (1962): &ldquo;The type locality is in the Carnegie Range, Western Australia, 40 miles north of the Rawlinson Range.&rdquo; Although not specifically stated, it is assumed that incomplete measured section RFX5 (52J 397130E 7314020N [base] to 52J 396720E 7315640N [top]; 4123 feet  [1257 m] thick) in this locality, detailed by Well et al. (1961, 1964), was meant as the type section. The unit is here overlain by Ellis Sandstone, but the base is not exposed. It should be noted that the position of Carnegie Range was shifted south by 33 km between the production of preliminary RAWLINSON geological maps (in Wells et al., 1961) and the final production (Forman, 1965). The Carnegie Range indicated by Forman (1965), and on current maps, is comprised of Dean Quartzite. The range that contains the Carnegie Formation type locality is referred to as Crockett Range on modern topographic maps. The Carnegie Formation was originally interpreted as an interfingering lateral equivalent of the now obsolete  Boord Formation  and thence correlated to the Inindia beds and Areyonga Formation in the NT (Wells et al., 1964), but the critical relationship with the 'Boord Formation' appears to have been misinterpreted due to poor outcrop and structural complications (Haines et al., 2010, 2012). The Carnegie Formation is now correlated with unit 1 of the Winnall beds in the southern and western NT Amadeus Basin and the lower Arumbera Sandstone in the northeast Amadeus Basin (Haines et al., 2012, 2015).  ",,"The Carnegie Formation is dominated by sandstone with interbedded siltstone units. The sandstone is most frequently medium-grained, but varies from fine-grained to rarely coarse-grained. It is rarely pebbly. Trough cross-bedding is common, and can be of large scale, with massive to plane-laminated beds also present. Rarer sedimentary structures include ripple marks, flute marks, current lineations and tool marks. The sandstone is typically red-brown or purple-brown when fresh (very rarely grey-green), but may weather to yellow or white locally. The sandstone in commonly texturally immature, being poorly sorted with abundant clay matrix. It is also typically mineralogically immature, being lithic and  feldspathic. It is locally micaceous and occasionally displays heavy mineral bands. It can vary from well-indurated to friable. More mature, white to pale brown, silicified quartz sandstone is present locally, mainly at the base of the formation (e.g. at PWHSFS000008 [MGA Zone 52 459001E 7338633N] and PWHERN000052 [MGA Zone 52 428281E 7320444N]). Interbedded siltstones are typically red-brown to purple in colour, and rarely grey-green. Siltstone units are generally poorly exposed and may be more common that suggested by surface outcrop. Beds containing red mud clasts are sometimes observed the sandstone, suggesting erosion and reworking of the siltstone units. Problematic organic remains referrable to  Arumberia  are common at a number of localities, particularly around the Sir Frederick Range, the Mu Hills, and Crockett Range.  Arumberia  was first described from an equivalent stratigraphic position in the eastern Amadeus Basin (Glaessner and Walter, 1975). In the Boord-Ridges/Gordon Hills reference area for the WA Amadeus Basin only the upper part of the Carnegie Formation is exposed. In the lower part of the exposure at the eastern end of the Gordon Hills the Carnegie Formation consists of red-brown to rarely grey-green, fine- to medium-grained, flaggy, micaceous sandstone and poorly exposed sandy siltstone. Thin sandstone beds commonly display erosive sole marks, includes flute casts. A bench-forming central unit comprises red-brown medium-grained sandstone with common trough cross-beds, current ripples, mud pellets and possible desiccation cracks. Some beds at this level have a lenticular channel-like morphology. The upper part of the formation is similar, but more recessive, comprising red-brown, medium-grained, friable, cross-bedded sandstone. Sandstone throughout the unit in this area is feldspathic/lithic and relatively immature.    ","The Carnegie Formation is interpreted to be at least partly of deltaic origin, with sediment derived from the south as the result of Petermann Orogeny uplift (Haines et al., 2012, 2015). It is likely to also include coastal plain and fluvial facies.",70,3400,,"The Carnegie Formation overlies the Julie Formation at the Boord Ridges, but the contact is covered (Haines and Allen, 2014). It is possible that minor interdigitation of the top Julie Formation and basal Carnegie Formation is present in the poor exposure west of Bonython Range (Haines et al., 2010), so a conformable relationship is inferred. In exposures further south the unit unconformably overlies the Bitter Springs Group where intervening units have been removed by erosion during early Petermann Orogeny uplift. It is overlain by the Ellis Sandstone and locally by the Sir Frederick Conglomerate, but the contacts are poorly exposed. The contact with the Ellis Sandstone appears to be concordant, but this is unclear.  ",,17,,,,4,,,,635,,510,,"A detrital zircon sample of the Carnegie Formation in the Mu Hills (GSWA 143783) gives a maximum depositional age of 819 Â± 13 Ma (1&sigma;) (Wingate et al., 2013; Haines et al., 2015, 2016), although this is significantly older than the inferred depositional age of mainly late Ediacaran based on other constraints. The underlying Julie Formation contains the stromatolite  Tungussia julia  which allows correlation to the Ediacaran of the eastern Amadeus Basin and elsewhere in Australia (Grey et al., 2012; Allen et al., 2012). The zircon age spectrum is consistent with derivation of sediment from uplifted Musgrave Province during the late Ediacaran-early Cambrian Petermann Orogeny (Haines et al., 2015, 2016). It is possible that the top of the Carnegie Formation is within the lower Cambrian. Problematic organic remains, including  Arumberia , originally described from the lower Arumbera Sandstone in the northeast Amadeus Basin (Glaessner and Walter, 1975), are locally common in the Carnegie Formation (Haines et al., 2010), but it is unclear if any of these have biostratigraphic significance.

It intrudes the southern extension of the Butchers Flat Shear Zone of Williams et al. (1989) and sheared rocks within the zone (A-gm-Y; A-xmws-mfs-YEG).  The Carpet Snake Syenogranite has been assigned to the low-Ca geochemical grouping of granitic rocks of Champion and Sheraton (1997). Although it has not been dated, Witt (1994) interpreted that it is intruded by the Galah Monzogranite (A-_gl-gm), which has a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 2642 Â± 8 Ma (Dunphy et al., 2003). The Carpet Snake Syenogranite is younger than the c. 2683 Ma greenstones of the Melita Formation (A-GIm-xfr-b), which it intrudes.","The surface expression of the Carpet Snake Syenogranite pluton is around, and to the north of, Dead Horse Rocks (Zone 51, MGA 332910E 6750400N) on southern MELITA. The western part of the Carpet Snake Syenogranite is poorly exposed. Aeromagnetic images show the pluton to be approximately 11.2 km north-south and 6.1 km east-west. The centre of the pluton is near Zone 51, MGA Zone 51 329700E 6753000N. It is deformed within the southern extension of the Butchers Flat shear zone of Williams et al. (1989). The maximum and minimum thicknesses of the pluton are not known.","The Carpet Snake Syenogranite is named after the Carpet Snake Soak on MELITA, near the southeastern margin of the pluton (Zone 51, MGA 333800E 6747000N; Witt, 1994), and the type locality is at Dead Horse Rocks (Zone 51, MGA 332910E 6750400N; Witt, 1994).",,"Witt (1994) described the Carpet Snake Syenogranite as a muscovite-biotite granite, ranging in composition from monzogranite to syenogranite. The primary minerals are quartz, plagioclase, potassium feldspar, biotite and muscovite, with minor titanite. Secondary minerals include carbonate, epidote and fluorite. The pluton is massive to weakly deformed, partially recrystallized, and has metasedimentary and metarhyodacite inclusions. Internal pegmatitic segregations are common, as are pegmatitic dyke swarms at the margins of the pluton.  A whole-rock geochemical analysis of a sample (Geoscience Australia sample 97969107) from this unit is available in Champion and Cassidy (2002). They assigned the Carpet Snake Syenogranite to the low-Ca granite grouping of Champion and Sheraton (1997).",,,,,"Based on aeromagnetic data and mapping, the Carpet Snake Syenogranite is interpreted to intrude the southern extension of the Butchers Flat Shear Zone of Williams et al. (1989) and the sheared rocks within that zone (A-gm-Y; A-xmws-mfs-YEG). It also intrudes volcanic and volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Melita Formation to the east (A-GIm-xfr-b). The syenogranite is intruded by the Galah Monzogranite (A-_gl-gm) to the south (Witt, 1994).  The contact between the Carpet Snake Syenogranite and the Melita Formation is a 500 m-wide zone of alternating bands of granite, aplite, pegmatite and greenstones (A-gr-Y). The contact rocks are not strongly deformed, except in thin zones where fissile, cherty layers may be mylonitic (Witt, 1994).  Witt (1994) stated that the Carpet Snake Syenogranite and Galah Monzogranite crosscut F 1  to F 3  folds of his interpreted deformation history for the Melita area. These intrusions are also interpreted to post-date most, but not all, movement on the Butchers Well shear zone of Williams et al. (1989), which may be the northern extension of the Moriaty shear zone of Witt (1994). Pegmatite dyke segregations within the granite and in the adjacent Melita Formation have been offset and boudinaged during dextral movement on the Butchers Flat shear zone (Witt, 1994). Based on aeromagnetic data, the Butchers Flat shear zone crosscuts and deforms the Carpet Snake Syenogranite, which appears less deformed than greenstone units within the shear zone.",,17,,,,4,,,,2683,,2642,,"The Carpet Snake Syenogranite has not been directly dated.

It has been intersected in wells in the central and southern Canning Basin, south of the Fitzroy Trough and Gregory Sub-basin. The group is probably present at depth in the Fitzroy Trough and Gregory Sub-basin, but below the depth of well intersections and beyond seismic resolution. The following is from Haines (2009). The group thickens towards the centre of the Kidson Sub-basin, where Lehmann (1984) estimates that it may reach or exceed 2000 m. The thickest well intersection is 1591 m in Kidson 1 in the southern Kidson Sub-basin. Isopachs of the Carribuddy Group are significantly controlled by the distribution of massive halite formations within the group.

371,3696,P_-KMc-bb,4610,Carson Volcanics,1,"Massive and amygdaloidal basalt and basaltic volcaniclastic rock; interbedded quartz sandstone, feldspathic sandstone, siltstone and chert","The Carson Volcanics represent a period of submarine and/or terrestrial mafic volcanism within the c. 1800 Ma Kimberley Group. They conformably overlie the King Leopold Sandstone and are conformably overlain by the Warton Sandstone. In the central Kimberley region the formation is unconformably overlain by the Neoproterozoic Mount House Group.  The volcanics are dominated by fine- to medium-grained tholeiitic basalt flows, the number of which is variable throughout the Kimberley region. They are dominantly coherent lavas with subordinate agglomerates, breccias, and pyroclastic material with minor peperite. Basalts are commonly amygdaloidal infilled with quartz, calcite, pyrite and other sulphide minerals.  The interbedded sedimentary rocks consist of thick- to thin-bedded sandstones with minor siltstones. Sandstones vary form quartz arenites to arkoses. Sedimentary structures include herringbone cross-stratification, symmetrical ripples and ripple lamination, swaly bedding/swaly cross-stratification, tidal couplets, and desiccation cracks.  The sedimentary rocks were probably deposited in a nearshore or shoreline setting. Evidence for bidirectional currents, tidal couplets, and desiccation cracks suggests a tidal plain setting with subaerial exposure. Planar cross-bedded and herringbone cross-laminated beds were probably deposited slightly further down the depositional profile in a fully marine, very shallow water setting (nearshore) under the influence of high current energies still tidally influenced. This tidal and nearshore environment was the setting for the extrusion of the Carson Volcanics mafic lavas, with peperites indicating the lavas were erupted onto water-logged, unconsolidated sediment.  The Carson Volcanics are intruded by the mafic sills of the Hart Dolerite. SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages of 1795 Â± 15 Ma and 1799 Â± 17 Ma (mean age of 1797 Â± 11 Ma) provide a minimum age of deposition of the lower Kimberley Group (including the Carson Volcanics).","The Carson Volcanics are widely distributed throughout the Kimberley Basin making rolling hills and occasional ridges. The most aerially extensive outcrops are found in the north, central, and west Kimberley region. In the north Kimberley region the Carson Volcanics are exposed from the Sir Fredrick Hills to the Barton Plain and southwards along the courses of the Carson and Drysdale Rivers on DRYSDALE 1:250 000 map sheet. The formation forms the Couchman and Foster Ranges on the extensive Gardner Plateau on ASHTON 1:250 000 map sheet. The Carson Volcanics are more easily weathered compared to the surrounding, more competent, King Leopold and Warton Sandstones. Consequently, most of the Kalumburu Road and a portion of the Gibb River Road were made through the volcanics. The exposures in the west Kimberley region are found on the Camden Peninsula, in the Panter Downs area surrounding the Harding Range, and the low land around the Synnot Range near Beverley Springs Homestead (PRINCE REGENT and CHARNLEY 1:250 000 map sheets). Thin outcrops of Carson Volcanics are found in the east Kimberley region on the northeast-trending margin of the Kimberley Basin (Durack Range) where it about the Halls Creek Orogen and where the lower Kimberley Group is condensed. The Carson Volcanics cover an area approximately 22,486 km 2 .","The Carson Volcanics were probably named after the outcrops around the Carson River which runs through the north Kimberley region. The Carson River erodes through the Carson Volcanics almost exclusively, from its source near the Couchman and Foster Ranges on the Gardner Plateau (ASHTON 1:250 000) northwards along below the Carson Escarpment towards the town of Kalumburu (DRYSDALE 1:250 000) before emptying into the Napier Broome Bay. The formation first appears in the literature in the explanatory notes of GORDON DOWNS 1:250 000 map sheet (SE52-10; Gemuts and Smith, 1968).",,"The Carson Volcanics contain both coherent and fragmental products of mafic volcanism interbedded with siliciclastic sedimentary rocks.  The mafic lavas are dominantly greenish, fine- to medium-grained, coherent tholeiitic basaltic flows which vary in number across the Kimberley region. Five separate flows were identified southeast of Teronis Gorge on BEDFORD 1:100 000 and in Barnett River Gorge on BARNETT 1:100 000 whereas seven flows have been identified on CHARNLEY 1:250 000 (Gellatly et al., 1969). On BARNETT and BEFORD individual flows are <10-25 m thick, with the overall thickness of the mafic unit being around 100 m. Basalts have irregularly shaped amygdaloidal tops and bases filled with chlorite, quartz, carbonate, pyrite and other sulfide minerals (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967; Griffin et al., 1993). Vugs <15 cm wide are seen at the tops of basalts infilled with drusy quartz. Fractures filled with sandstone and basalt are seen at the top of a basalt unit near Barnett River Gorge. Polygonal joints are characteristic, but do not form columns. Instead, the polygonal joints intersect in three dimensions. Polygons formed vary in width from 5 cm near the tops of some units to 50 cm in the basalt interior. Near the entrance of Gibb River Station early polygonal fractures are filled with epidote Â± quartz and then overprinted by later joints. Breccias comprising mixed basalt and fine-grained sandstone were observed at three locations at the base of basalt units on MOUNT ELIZABETH 1:250 000. Pyroclastic deposits including basaltic bombs in a tuffaceous matrix indicate proximity to a volcanic centre on YAMPI 1:250 000 (Tyler and Griffin, 1993) as well as local pyroclastic material on MOUNT ELIZABETH 1:250 000 (Roberts and Perry, 1970).  The interbedded sediments are either quartz- of feldspar-rich sandstones with subordinate siltstone. The quartz sandstones are white, medium-bedded, very fine or fine-grained, massive, well-sorted, silica-cemented quartz arenites with subrounded grains and rare cross-bedding. Feldspathic variants are thick- to thin-bedded, fine-grained, well-sorted, arkose. The arkosic sandstone and mudstone contain massive beds up to 0.8 m thick. On BEDFORD (CXPMTE000254 and CXPMTE000256) the arkosic sandstones preserve many sedimentary structures including herringbone cross-stratification, symmetrical ripples/ripple lamination, possible swaly bedding/cross-stratification, erosive contacts/truncated bedding, possible tidal couplets, and possible desiccation cracks. Crest heights in the ripples are < 10 mm and the wavelength of straight-crested ripples is < 40 mm. Lens-shaped beds of ripped up red siltstone intraclasts are common (1-15 mm wide), although most are weathered out and are hollow. Mudstone forms a 2 m thick succession with intercalated fine-grained sandstone near the base of the lowest arkosic sandstone unit. Mudstone beds are < 0.2 m thick and drape ripples in fine-grained sandstone. Some mudstone is laminated and commonly micaceous. The sedimentary units within the Carson Volcanics are relatively undeformed. Quartz sandstones appear to have been recrystallised while outcrops at CXPMTE000254 just off the Gibb River Road on SULLIVAN 1:100 000 appear to be altered as feldspar is altering to epidote. This alteration and recrystallization is probably the result of metasomatism from the surrounding mafic lavas, percolating hydrothermal fluids with increased geothermal gradients, later very low grade metamorphism, or a combination.  Algal or stromatolitic cherts are observed in the sediments on CHARNLEY and DRYSDALE-LONDONDERRY 1:250 000 map sheets (Gellatly et al., 1969; Gellatly and Sofoulis, 1969). These are rare lithofacies within the Carson Volcanics.","Interlayered sedimentary units within the basalts on BEDFORD 1:100 000 preserve many sedimentary structures indicative of a shallow marine or intertidal setting. Such structures include herringbone cross-stratification, tidal couplets (both indicating bidirectional currents), abundant cross-bedding, soft sediment deformation and water escape structures, desiccation cracks (indicating subaerial exposure; CXPLSN000144). The stromatolites discovered on CHARNLEY and DRYSDALE-LONDONDERRY 1:250 000 (Gellatly et al., 1969; Gellatly and Sofoulis, 1969 indicate a shallow-water setting, within the photic zone (<100 m water depth). The decrease in feldspar in the interbedded sediments to the west is a probable indication of increasing transport distance from the source area/coast. The intertidal features found only on BEDFORD 1:100 000 and dominant cross-bedding in sediments to the west also suggests that the shoreline lay to the east at this time. A paleoflow from the northwest was observed from cross-bedding on BEDFORD (CXPLSN000144) which is consistent with paleoflow directions taken from the bounding King Leopold and Warton Sandstones (Gellatly et al., 1970).  The basalts appear to be coherent lava flows. The sedimentary packages suggest a shallow subaqueous depositional environment. Peperite at the base of the uppermost basalt in the BEDFORD area suggest that at least some of the sedimentary units were wet and unconsolidated at the time of basalt emplacement. The polygonal jointing, characteristic of the Carson Volcanic basalts is not well documented in the literature, but is noted for basaltic andesite on the margins of cryptodomes (Goto, 1996) and intrusions. It is similar to structures in silicic intrusions into wet sediments (e.g. McPhie et al., 1993) and similar to entablature, where broken polygonal joints are present are at the top and bottom of columnar joints in some basalt lava flows (e.g. Staffa, UK and Columbia River Basalts).

The name Castlereagh Hill Porphyry is retained for the microgranodiorite, which is exposed around the type area at Castlereagh Hill on the LISSADEL 1:250 000 sheet area. The strongly porphyritic rock unit is redefined as the Greenvale Porphyry, which is mainly exposed to the southwest on  MOUNT REMARKABLE (Sheppard et al., 1997b).","The Castlereagh Hill Porphyry outcrops in two north-northeasterly trending belts around Castlereagh Hill and in the O'Donnell Range, and underneath the scarp along the western edge of the Ragged Range. In the O'Donnell Range the porphyry forms a dissected plateau about 200-250 m above the surrounding granite country. Elsewhere the porphyry forms rounded or steep hills with a smoother pattern than that of the granites on aerial photographs and Landsat TM images. The Castlereagh Hill Porphyry also outcrops in a small (~2 km 2 ) outlier southwest of the Carr Boyd lead-zinc-silver occurrence on the western edge of Lake Argyle.",,,"The bulk of the Castlereagh Hill Porphyry consists of dark-grey, massive microgranodiorite with fine to medium phenocrysts of plagioclase. Locally (e.g. 2-3 km southeast of Mount Lookout), the unit may coarsen, having a fine- to medium-grained groundmass and phenocrysts up to nearly 7 mm long. These coarser grained parts of the Castlereagh Hill Porphyry strongly resemble the Crooked Creek Granite. The exposure underneath the Ragged Range is a sheet-like intrusion which grades from a medium-grained porphyry at the base through a fine grained porphyry to a black, very fine grained porphyry at the top (Gemuts, 197 1). Most samples are moderately to strongly altered, and micrographic and myrmekitic intergrowths between quartz and feldspars are widespread. Fine-grained, aphyric mafic inclusions are generally sparse but widespread.  Most samples contain 15-25% phenocrysts of subhedral plagioclase some 1-2 mm long, minor pseudomorphs after hornblende and biotite, and rare quartz and K-feldspar, in a fine- or very fine grained groundmass with a granular texture. Scattered microphenocrysts of opaque minerals are also present. The groundmass is composed of quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, chlorite, sericite, epidote, and accessory apatite and zircon. Micrographic and granophyric intergrowths between quartz and K-feldspar, as well as myrmekitic intergrowths between quartz and plagioclase, are widespread. Most samples from the Castlereagh Hill Porphyry are moderately to strongly altered. Microcrystalline sericite and calcite (or clinozoisite) replace phenocryst and groundmass plagioclase. Hornblende is pseudomorphed by chlorite, quartz and epidote, and chlorite and quartz replace biotite.",,,,,"The contact between the Castlereagh Hill Porphyry and the Whitewater Volcanics was not observed on the LISSADELL 1:250 000 sheet area. The relationship between the porphyry and individual plutons of the Paperbark supersuite on BOW is not known, and faulting has complicated many of the contacts. However, 5 km south of Pompeys Pillar, just north of the highway, medium-grained granodiorite of the Crooked Creek Granite contains numerous inclusions of Castlereagh Hill Porphyry over an area of about 40 m 2 . The inclusions are up to one metre in diameter, are rounded, and contacts with the host granodiorite vary from curvilinear to weakly cuspate. The rounded shape of the inclusions, and the cuspate margins of some inclusions, suggest that the porphyry was not rigid when included in the granodiorite. The inclusion shapes and textures are consistent with either the granodiorite having intruded incompletely solidified porphyry, or porphyry having intruded partly crystallized granodiorite (i.e. the inclusions represent a swarm).

However, it has been defined as a separate member in recognition of its unique stratigraphic relationship at the top of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation. It is also meant to facilitate more accurate description of the various glacigenic diamictites in the region. The member consists of a 4-5 m-thick interval of interbedded mudstone, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone with minor conglomerate and local glacial dropstones. It is overlain by 10-15 m of iron formation that are also included in the unit. The depositional age of the Cave Hill Member is poorly constrained to between c. 2445 and 2420 Ma.","The Cave Hill Member constitutes the upper 15-20 m of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation. It is present throughout the area between the northern limb of the Wyloo Inler and exposures near Yeera Bluff (Zone 50, MGA 411040E 7599260N) and in the Brockman Syncline on WYLOO, HARDEY, MOUNT STUART, FARQUHAR, and PANNAWONICA. The Cave Hill Member is not present at the eastern end of the Wyloo Inlier or in the thin succession southeast of Mount Maguire (Zone 50, MGA 576473E 7418996N) where the Turee Creek Group paraconformably overlies the middle or basal iron formation units of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation. This relationship is also true of most of the Hardey Syncline, although the Cave Hill Member is locally present here, albeit with a reduced thickness of glacigenic facies. The member has not been identified in the Turner or Turee Creek Synclines or east of Newman, primarily due to the upper contact of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation being obscured by younger cover.","The Cave Hill Member was originally considered a correlative of the Meteorite Bore Member (Martin, 1999). However, owing to its unique stratigraphic relationships it is now defined as a distinctive regional marker unit within the Boolgeeda Iron Formation as defined by Trendall and Blockley (1970). This revised definition is also in keeping with stratigraphic affinities implied from isotopic sulfur studies (Swanner et al., 2013). The name is derived from Cave Hill (Zone 50, MGA 452630E 4511820N) on northwest HARDEY, which is approximately 2 km northwest of the proposed type section (Zone 50, MGA 450880E 7510040N).",,"The Cave Hill Member is a distinctive 4-5 m-thick sedimentary interval. It consists of interbedded mudstone, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone with minor conglomerate (locally dolomitic). The conglomerate contains distinctive, localized, outsized glacial dropstones. It is both underlain and overlain by flaggy to fissile magnetic iron formation. The member includes the overlying 10-15 m of iron formation and a thin manganiferous iron formation horizon identified by Van Kranendonk and Mazumder (2015). The size, composition, and morphology of the outsized clasts are similar to those in the Meteorite Bore Member (P_-TKkm-sd), with the added advantage of preserving clear evidence of vertical emplacement as dropstones (Martin, 1999; Van Kranendonk and Mazumder, 2015; Van Kranendonk et al., 2015). In addition to the distinctive Woongarra Rhyolite clasts, the Cave Hill Member commonly contains abundant dolomite clasts, some of which are oolitic (e.g. at Yeera Bluff, Zone 50, MGA 412545E 7599060N), and rare granite clasts. Where outsized clasts are absent, the thin upper BIF is a useful stratigraphic marker for the Cave Hill Member. Sandstones are commonly massive to planar- or ripple-laminated, with locally preserved slump structures, whereas siltstones and mudstones are massive to planar-laminated with local discoidal chert concretions. The uppermost iron formation is lithologically similar to the underlying Boolgeeda Iron Formation. It consists of flaggy to fissile laminated, grey chert, jaspilitic chert, and silicified ferruginous siltstone. The Cave Hill Member is distinctive on aerial photos from the recessive-weathering glacial facies and thin resistant overlying iron formation.","The Cave Hill Member is interpreted to have been deposited in open-marine conditions in a very distal setting with respect to the grounding line of marine glaciers. Facies associations in the Duck Creek Syncline and at Yeera Bluff are suggestive of deposition well below storm wave base with a significant local contribution due to rain out from floating sea ice or icebergs (Martin, 1999). Background marine sedimentation is interpreted as having been the product of sediment plumes, dilute debris flows, and turbidites derived from basinward reworking of glacigenic detritus, and the precipitation of iron, silica, and manganese from within the water column. At Yeera Bluff, there is minor evidence for reworking of glacigenic detritus by thermohaline currents. Evidence of in situ deposition from floating ice, such as dropstones, is preserved north of the Wyloo Dome in the vicinity of Zone 50, MGA 453900E 7508400N and Zone 50, MGA 411900E 7599400N. The erratic distribution of dropstones within the Cave Hill Member suggests that the region was neither covered by an extensive ice shelf nor subject to a high iceberg flux (Martin, 1999).   The results of sulphur isotope analysis of pyrite in the Cave Hill Member and its paleoenvironmental significance (Williford et al., 2011; Swanner et al., 2013), particularly in relation to global correlation and documentation of the Great Oxidation Event, are controversial. This is primarily because of the presence of detrital pyrite and retention of a positive mass-independent sulfur isotope fractionation (MIF-S) signal and uncertainties in local correlation. These data suggest that atmospheric oxygen levels during deposition of the Cave Hill Member were not high enough to permanently eliminate the MIF-S signal. ",,20,,"The Cave Hill Member conformably overlies flaggy to fissile BIF in the upper part of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation in the Duck Creek Syncline on northwest HARDEY and northeast WYLOO, the Brockman Syncline on HARDEY and ROCKLEA, and at Yeera Bluff on PANNAWONICA (Martin, 1999; Van Kranendonk et al., 2015). The member is also locally present in the Hardey Syncline on ROCKLEA.  The upper contact in all these areas is marked by an abrupt conformable lithological change from iron formation to shale of the overlying Kungarra Formation or undivided Turee Creek Group. The upper iron formation at Yeera Bluff has been interpreted on structural grounds to belong to the Ashburton Formation, and to overlie a local unconformity (Van Kranendonk and Mazumder, 2015). However, in a well-exposed railway cutting (DMMHAM000417, Zone 50, MGA 410383E 7600231N) this contact appears conformable. In areas where the Cave Hill Member is not present, such as in parts of the Hardey Syncline and possibly all of the Turee Creek Syncline, the upper contact is interpreted to be paraconformable with the Turee Creek Group.",,17,,,,5,,,,2444,,2420,,"The depositional age of the Cave Hill Member is poorly constrained.

4222,3941,P_-SKb-bb,3764,Cheela Springs Basalt,1,"Amygdaloidal basalt and minor volcaniclastic rock; immature sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone; intruded by Balgara Dolerite sills","The Cheela Springs Basalt has a maximum thickness of ~2890 m and is exposed on PANNAWONICA, MOUNT STUART, WYLOO, HARDEY, ROCKLEA, PARABURDOO, and SNOWY MOUNT, where it conformably overlies the Beasley River Quartzite. In most areas it is unconformably overlain by the Mount McGrath formation, except around the southeastern limb of Wyloo Dome and north of the dome, and southeast of Mount Maguire where it has a conformable to erosional upper contact with the Wooly Dolomite. The Cheela Springs Basalt is composed of amygdaloidal basalt and minor volcaniclastic rock, together with immature sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone, and is intruded by the Balgara Dolerite (P_-_bg-od). More significant thicknesses of sedimentary rock and intercalated basalt have been recorded as a separate unit, the Nummana Member (P_-SKbn-xs-b), which forms a useful regional marker at the base of the formation. These rocks were deposited in a coastal to shallow marine environment at c. 2208 Ma.","The Cheela Springs Basalt is exposed on PANNAWONICA, MOUNT STUART, WYLOO, HARDEY, ROCKLEA, PARABURDOO, and in the core of the Turee Creek Syncline on SNOWY MOUNT. The most complete section is preserved on the southeastern flank of the Hardey Syncline on HARDEY, where Dow (1996) recorded a maximum thickness of ~2890 m in a measured section west of Shingle Creek.","The Cheela Springs Basalt was established by MacLeod et al. (1963) as part of the then newly defined Wyloo Group. The formation was initially considered to both overlie and underlie a thick succession of coarse- to fine-grained sedimentary rocks, the Mount McGrath Beds, however the exact stratigraphic relationship between the basalt and the sedimentary rocks was unclear. Subsequently Halligan and Daniels (1964) and de la Hunty (1964), confirmed that the Mount McGrath Beds were deposited above the Cheela Springs Basalt and upgraded the name to Mount McGrath Formation, with the Cheela Springs Basalt included as a member of this formation. This nomenclature was followed by Daniels (1970) and by Trendall (1975, 1979).  Horwitz (1980) recognized a regional disconformity at the top of the Cheela Springs Basalt Member and removed these rocks from the Mount McGrath Formation, while at the same time upgrading them to the level of formation. He also recognized a unit of  tuffaceous looking shales  (Horwitz, 1980, p. 4) at the base of the formation, but did not name it. However, de la Hunty (1964) had previously recognized a unit of interbedded siltstone and quartzite at this stratigraphic level in his Mount McGrath Formation in the core of the Hardey Syncline, which he named the Nummana Member. More recently, Martin et al. (2000) revised the Cheela Springs Basalt to include the Nummana Member, a mixed assemblage of sedimentary and basaltic rocks at the base of the formation.  Although the disconformity at the top of the Cheela Springs Basalt was recognized by various workers (Horwitz, 1980; Seymour et al., 1988; Thorne and Seymour, 1991), its temporal significance was unknown and did not lead to a redefinition of the Wyloo Group. More recently a c. 2208 Ma mafic magmatic event, responsible for deposition of the Cheela Springs Basalt and coeval dolerite intrusion into the Beasley River Quartzite and underlying Turee Creek Group, has been identified and provides a reliable age for the lower part of the Wyloo Group (Martin et al., 1998; M&uuml;ller et al., 2005; Martin and Morris, 2010). In contrast, the maximum age of the upper Wyloo Group is fixed by ages of c. 2030 Ma and c. 2008 Ma that were published for the Wooly Dolomite and for dolerite dykes that post-date the lower Wyloo Group but pre-date the Mount McGrath Formation (M&uuml;ller et al., 2005). These data show there is a hiatus of at least 200 Ma between deposition of the lower and upper parts of the Wyloo Group. This in turn has led to a revision of the Wyloo Group, with the Beasley River Quartzite and Cheela Springs Basalt (formerly the lower Wyloo Group) now assigned to the Shingle Creek Group, and the Mount McGrath Formation, Duck Creek Dolomite, June Hill Volcanics and Ashburton Formation (formerly the upper Wyloo Group) being retained within the restructured Wyloo Group. The c. 2030 Ma age for the Wooly Dolomite indicates that this unit was laid down in the interval between deposition of the Shingle Creek and Wyloo Groups.  Although not specifically mentioned by MacLeod et al. (1963), the name Cheela Springs Basalt was presumably taken from Cheela Springs (Zone 50, MGA 483780E 7461400N) on southeastern HARDEY. No type-section was defined by MacLeod et al. (1963); however, Dow (1996) suggested that this should be located at Shingle Creek (Zone 50, MGA 486200E 7469000N), on the southeastern part of HARDEY, where he measured a section on the west side of the creek.",,"The Cheela Springs Basalt is composed of amygdaloidal basalt and minor volcaniclastic rock, together with immature sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone. Parts of the succession are intruded by dolerite sills. Significant thicknesses of sedimentary rock and intercalated basalt occur near the base of the formation and have been recorded as a separate unit (Nummana Member, P_-SKbn-xs-b). The Cheela Springs Basalt is weakly to moderately resistant to weathering and erosion and forms low hills and strike ridges.  Basalt flows generally have a tabular geometry, are amygdaloidal, and range in thickness from about 0.5 to 80 m. M&uuml;ller (2005) recorded sixty-five basalt flows, in a section through the Cheela Springs Basalt near Shingle Creek (MGA Zone 50, 486200E 7469000N). In this area the flows average 30 m thickness and maximum flow thickness increases upwards from ~35 m at the base to ~50 m at the top (Dow, 1996). Thorne and Seymour (1991) noted that some flows are medium grained in the middle, but grain size decreases, and vesicularity and brecciation increase, in upper parts. Columnar joints are preserved in the lower parts of some flows (M&uuml;ller, 2005). Flow tops are irregular and pitted, and the hollows are locally filled with fine- to coarse-grained, massive to parallel-planar laminated or ripple-laminated, mafic volcaniclastic rock. Straight-crested symmetrical ripples, interpreted as wave ripples, are preserved locally on the upper surface of the volcaniclastic layers. M&uuml;ller (2005) noted that hyaloclastite layers up to several metres thick are widespread in the Cheela Springs Basalt; however, pillow lava has not been observed.  Most basalt has undergone pervasive prehnite-pumpellyite to lower greenschist facies metamorphism. In areas of low metamorphic grade, such as north of the Wyloo Dome, these rocks comprise phenocrysts of andesine and clinopyroxene (partly replaced by actinolite and chlorite) set in a groundmass of andesine, actinolite, chlorite, sphene, epidote, pumpellyite, and iron oxide. At higher metamorphic grades, the clinopyroxene is completely replaced by actinolite and chlorite (Thorne and Seymour, 1991).  The geochemistry of the Cheela Springs Basalt was first described by Dow (1996), who identified subtle changes in basalt chemistry with stratigraphic height, consistent with a change from within-plate continental tholeiite at the base, to volcanic-arc tholeiitic basalt at the top. This broad geochemical discrimination is reflected in the topographic expression of the formation in the type section, where the upper part is characterised by more pronounced relief. His findings were largely confirmed by M&uuml;ller (2005) who also noted that dolerite sills intruded into the Turee Creek Group (Balgara Dolerite, P_-_bg-od) have a similar chemistry to the Cheela Springs Basalt. The data from both of these studies was subsequently reinterpreted by Martin and Morris (2010), who were also able to recognize compositional variations with stratigraphic height in the Cheela Springs Basalt, but attributed these to either melting of a common mantle source at different depths, or multiple extractions of melts from the same mantle source. Martin and Morris (2010) also demonstrated that the Balgara Dolerite intrudes both the Turee Creek and Shingle Creek Groups, and both predates and postdates the unconformities at the base of the Anthiby Formation (P_-TKn-sf) and Beasley River Quartzite (P_-SKq-stq).","Based on the character of the basalt flows and the nature of the interbedded sedimentary and volcaniclastic facies, Thorne and Seymour (1991) interpreted the Cheela Springs Basalt as having been laid down in a coastal to shallow-marine setting. Later work by M&uuml;ller (2005) noted that sedimentary facies in upper parts of the formation were probably deposited below wave base, indicating a change to deeper marine conditions with time.",,2890,,"The Cheela Springs Basalt has a conformable, sharp lower contact with the Beasley River Quartzite marked by an abrupt change to either siltstone or vesicular basalt. The formation generally has an unconformable upper contact with the Mount McGrath Formation, apart from on the southeastern flank of the Wyloo Dome and north of the dome, and southeast of Mount Maguire where it has a conformable to erosional upper contact with the Wooly Dolomite (M&uuml;ller, 2005; KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2015).",,17,,,,4,,,,2208,,2031,,"The depositional age of the Cheela Springs Basalt is probably close to c. 2208 Ma, based on geochronological data from a volcaniclastic deposit within the formation, and also from dolerite sills that intrude the Shingle Creek Group and underlying Turee Creek Group.  Martin et al. (1998) reported an age of 2209 Â± 15 Ma from a poorly bedded volcaniclastic breccia in the Cheela Springs Basalt, near the contact with the unconformably overlying Mount McGrath Formation. Although this age determination is strictly a maximum age, it was interpreted by these authors as close to the true age of deposition. This age for the Cheela Springs Basalt is within uncertainty of two separate U-Pb SHRIMP baddeleyite ages of 2208 Â± 10 Ma, one obtained from a dolerite sill (Balgara Dolerite, P_-_bg-od) that intrudes the Turee Creek Group in the Hardey Syncline, and the other from a Balgara Dolerite sill that intrudes the Shingle Creek Group in the Turee Creek Syncline (M&uuml;ller et al., 2005; Martin and Morris, 2010). Taken together, the ages from the Cheela Springs Basalt and dolerite sills record a major magmatic event in the southern Pilbara during the early stages of the 2215-2145 Ma Ophthalmia Orogeny (Rasmussen et al, 2005; Martin and Morris, 2010). Since there are no age determinations from the top of the group, which is locally in conformable contact with the Wooly Dolomite, a conservative minimum age is provided by the U-Pb zircon SHRIMP date of 2031 Â± 6 Ma (M&uuml;ller et al., 2005) obtained from a felsic volcaniclastic horizon towards the base of the dolomitic unit.   The fault-bounded outlier of basalt and gabbro, shown on the second edition of WYLOO 1:250 000 at Zone 50, MGA 450290E 7523700N, has been interpreted as a possible feeder for the Cheela Springs Basalt (Thorne and Seymour, 1991). However, these fault-bounded rocks have yielded a U-Pb SHRIMP baddeleyite age of 1832 Â± 9 Ma (M&uuml;ller, 2005), which indicates they are younger than the Cheela Springs Basalt and are probably instead related to c. 1829 Ma mafic volcanic rocks (P_-WYa-bbo) in the Ashburton Formation on BOGGOLA and KENNETH RANGE (Sircombe, 2003).",No,,,1,,No,Published,No,Yes,P_,SKb,,,,,MIGSDDM,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

Most of the Cheyne Springs Formation is made up of dololutite, dolarenite, dolorudite, mudstone, siltstone, and minor sandstone. More significant thicknesses of interbedded sandstone and siltstone on MAROONAH are mapped as a separate member (P_-MEp-ss). The Cheyne Springs Formation ranges in thickness from 50 to 300 m and is confined to the Pingandy Shelf on ULLAWARRA, CAPRICORN, ELLIOTT CREEK, KENNETH RANGE, BOGGOLA, TEANO, and MOUNT VERNON, and to the southwestern limb of the Wanna Syncline on MAROONAH, MANGAROON, and EDMUND. The Cheyne Springs Formation is interpreted as an assemblage of shelf and pelagic deposits that mark a slight shallowing of the Edmund Basin following the Blue Billy Formation transgression. The age of the Cheyne Springs Formation is poorly known, but was probably deposited between c. 1673 and 1517 Ma.","The Cheyne Springs Formation is mostly confined to the Pingandy Shelf on ULLAWARRA, CAPRICORN, ELLIOTT CREEK, KENNETH RANGE, BOGGOLA, TEANO, and MOUNT VERNON and is also present on the southwestern limb of the Wanna Syncline on MAROONAH, MANGAROON, and EDMUND. The formation ranges in thickness from 50 to 300 m, but seldom exceeds 200 m. It is thickest immediately adjacent to the Talga Fault on ULLAWARRA and thins rapidly to the south and southeast beneath a disconformity at the base of the Kiangi Creek Formation.","The Cheyne Springs Formation was originally defined by Chuck (1984) to include the dolomite and subordinate interbedded terrigenous sedimentary rocks occurring above the Gooragoora and Jillawarra Formations and below the Kiangi Creek Formation in the lower half of the Florry Subgroup (now Edmund Group). The original boundaries and regional correlations of Chuck (1984) were modified by Martin and Thorne (2002) as a result of their abandonment of the Jillawarra Formation and redefinition of the Kiangi Creek Formation. In particular the basal 700 m of argillaceous rocks in the Cheyne Springs type section that were initially included within the Jillawarra Formation are now assigned to the Blue Billy Formation.  The name of the formation was derived from Cheyne Spring, located at Zone 50, MGA 451060E 7403400N on CAPRICORN (Chuck, 1984). The type area is south and southeast of the confluence of Doolgarrie and Irregully Creeks on ULLAWARRA (Zone 50, MGA 446300E 7411600N). Well exposed outcrops on Irregully Creek, 6.5 km north-northwest of Cheyne Spring (Zone 50, MGA 448780E 7409680N) have been proposed as a type section by Chuck (1984). A representative section of the upper part of the Cheyne Springs Formation is shown in Figure 7 of Martin and Thorne (2002).",,"The Cheyne Springs Formation (P_-MEp-kd) comprises interbedded dololutite, dolarenite, dolorudite, mudstone, siltstone, and minor sandstone. More significant thicknesses of interbedded sandstone and siltstone on MAROONAH are mapped as a separate member (P_-MEp-ss). In the lower part of the Cheyne Springs Formation the proportion of dolostone interbeds increases up-section and is accompanied by an increase in bed thickness. The Cheyne Springs Formation is characterized by a distinctive striped outcrop pattern and is commonly manganiferous, especially on ULLAWARRA.  Dolostones are strongly recrystallized and may contain numerous anhedral to euhedral, iron-oxide molds or layers after former pyrite. The dolostones generally contain quartz silt and sand and are interbedded with minor, thin-bedded siltstone and sandstone. Dololutites and fine-grained dolarenites are thin to medium bedded and generally have a tabular to gently lenticular geometry. The internal structure of most beds is either massive or parallel planar to gently undulatory laminated, with local scour surfaces and ripple cross-lamination. In rare cases these fine-grained dolostones are stromatolitic and display irregular domical and  Conophyton -like forms. Medium- to very coarse grained dolarenites are either massive or else show parallel planar and gently undulatory lamination with local scour surfaces, trough cross-stratification and ripple cross-lamination. The latter give paleocurrents towards the west-northwest. Dolorudites are medium- to very thick bedded and tabular- to lenticular-bedded. Most are clast-supported and massive, although some display stratabound, syndepositional or early diagenetic folds. Clasts are generally tabular and composed of dololutite.  Mudstone, siltstone, and dolomitic siltstone are generally thin- to medium-bedded and are either parallel-planar laminated or ripple cross-laminated. Many beds contain anhedral to euhedral molds and layers of iron oxide after former pyrite. Petrographically, the dolomitic siltstone consists of planar laminated, normally graded, very fine grained, subrounded to rounded sandstone to siltstone with abundant detrital muscovite flakes and trace amounts of plagioclase (Martin et al., 2005). The matrix consists of euhedral carbonate, probably dolomite, weathered to goethite. The thin sandstone beds consist mainly of subrounded to rounded quartz grains, with minor lithic clasts, K-feldspar and plagioclase, detrital muscovite, and trace tourmaline. Secondary euhedral dolomite is partially weathered to goethite and quartz grains are rimmed with syntaxial quartz cement.   Sandstone and dolomitic sandstone beds increase in abundance up-section and are mostly fine- to medium-grained and thin- to very thick-bedded, although thicker bedded, medium- to coarse-grained sandstones are also observed. Many sandstones contain scattered iron-oxide molds after former pyrite and some dolomitic quartz wackes contain large floating tabular clasts of dolomitic siltstone and fine-grained sandstone. Bedding within the sandstone units is often tabular to sublenticular; however, strongly lenticular, channelized units are also observed on ULLAWARRA. Basal bedding surfaces are generally sharp and planar. However, some are marked by load structures. Others display a weak paleocurrent lineation defined by flute and groove casts. Upper bedding surfaces are planar to undulose and may exhibit ripple bedforms locally. Fine- to medium-grained quartz arenite beds are typically less than 10 cm thick, and parallel planar to ripple cross-laminated, with cubic pseudomorphs after pyrite concentrated at the base and in ripple troughs. Undulatory and hummocky cross-stratification is also observed in places. Paleocurrent directions, determined mainly from ripple cross-lamination and current lineation on the soles of sandstone beds indicate flow was directed in a broad sector, from the south to toward the northwest.  ","The Cheyne Springs Formation has been interpreted as an assemblage of shelf and pelagic dolostones and associated siliciclastic deposits (Chuck, 1984) that marks a slight shallowing of the Edmund Basin following the Blue Billy Formation transgression (Martin and Thorne, 2004). The presence of sandstone-dolostone couplets with localized flutes and tool marks and hummocky cross-stratification suggests shallowing to storm wave-base. Paleocurrent data from sandstone units indicate a broadly southwest-sloping shelf.",,300,,"The Cheyne Springs Formation has a gradational or sharp, conformable lower contact with siltstones and mudstones of the Blue Billy Formation. In the case of gradational contacts, the boundary is defined by the first and last appearance, respectively, of dolostone or dolomitic siltstone. The formation has a disconformable upper contact with the sandstones of the Kiangi Creek Formation.",,17,,,,4,,,,1673,,1517,,"The age of the Cheyne Springs Formation is poorly known, but was probably deposited between c. 1673 Ma and 1517 Ma. This age range is based upon geochronological data from underlying and overlying units within the Capricorn Orogen.  The maximum age of the Cheyne Springs Formation is loosely constrained by its stratigraphic position, in which it is located at a higher stratigraphic position within the Edmund Group than Depositional Package 1 (Martin and Thorne 2004). The older age limit for Depositional package 1 is provided by the c. 1673 Ma maximum age of the underlying Yilgatherra Formation (P_-MEy-st). Depositional package 1 overlies granitic rocks of the 1680-1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite in the Gascoyne Province (Sheppard et al., 2010). The Discretion Granite on MARQUIS is the youngest granite in the Durlacher Supersuite and has been dated at 1619 Â± 15 Ma (GSWA 142855, Nelson, 1998; Sheppard et al., 2010); however, the boundary between the Discretion Granite and Depositional Package 1 is faulted and the true nature of the contact, whether it is intrusive or unconformable, cannot be determined.  The minimum age for the Cheyne Springs Formation is given by the age of the Waldburg Dolerite that intrudes underlying and overlying parts of the Edmund Group. Wingate et al. (GSWA 206916, 2015a) determined an age of 1517 Â± 8 Ma from a sill of Waldburg Dolerite, intruded into the Kiangi Creek Formation on southeastern MOUNT AUGUSTUS. Another sill, intruded along the disconformable contact between the Irregully and Kiangi Creek Formations on MOUNT AUGUSTUS, yielded an age of 1513 Â± 5 Ma (GSWA 206991, Wingate et al., 2015b). Sills of the Narimbunna Dolerite, which intrude overlying units of the Edmund Group are younger than the Waldburg Dolerite and have been dated at c. 1465 Ma by Wingate (2002).   The earliest phase of mineralization in the underlying Irregully and Gooragoora Formation host rocks at the Abra polymetallic deposit has been dated at 1610 Â± 16 Ma, based on the U-Pb age of hydrothermal xenotime within the deposit (Zi et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2015). Mineralization and hydrothermal fluid flow, in the same part of the stratigraphy, continued until at least 1590 Â± 9 Ma (Zi et al., 2015). The relationship of these mineralization events to the Cheyne Springs Formation is unknown; however, they could have occurred either before or after the Cheyne Springs Formation was deposited.",No,,,1,,No,Published,No,No,P_,MEp,,,,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

The type area is along the Wongawol-Wiluna road, north from the foot of the range north of Kepaltin Pool on WONGAWOL, from 393700E, 7099000N to 393500E, 7109200N. The base of the type section is a ferruginized and glauconitic intraclast breccia dominated by clasts derived from stromatolitic carbonate of the Windidda Formation immediately below. In deeper parts of the basin, to the north and west, the hardground and overlying conglomerate and sandstone interval is now thought to be represented by the Karri Karri Member, the base of which is the top of the last granular iron-formation or chert interval. The formation is a coarsening- and shallowing-upward succession, dominated by siltstone and shale, but punctuated by sandstone intervals that become increasingly thick and common upward and eastward. Essentially, the Wandiwarra Member contains texturally and compositionally less mature sandstone intervals than the Princess Ranges Member &mdash; much of the Wandiwarra Member is lithic wacke and quartz wacke, whereas the Princess Ranges Member is characterized by the presence of quartz arenite. The Karri Karri Member, to the west, is a deeper water correlative of the Wandiwarra Member.  SHRIMP U-Pb dating of detrital zircons from the Chiall Formation reveal a maximum possible depositional age of ca 1.87 Ga (Halilovic et al., 2004; Sheppard et al., 2016).",,"The Chiall Formation consists predominantly of very fine grained sandstone, siltstone, shale and mudstone punctuated by generally fine- to medium-grained, thin to very thick, sandstone intervals, minor conglomerate, and intraclastic breccia. Ball-and-pillow load structures are locally common. The formation represents a change from combined chemical and fine-grained clastic sedimentation, to sandier clastic deposition.  Interbedded siltstone, mudstone, shale and fine- to very fine-grained, locally calcareous sandstone typifies the part of the Chiall Formation below the Princess Ranges Member and is similar to the lower part of the Wongawol Formation. Sandstone contains green iron silicate minerals, especially near the base. These green iron silicate grains are mostly glauconite, but other iron-bearing species such as berthierine and chamosite are probably also present. In addition, jasper peloids are also common at the base of the Chiall Formation in fine and very fine-grained sandstone. Green iron silicate grains are commonly peloidal and oolitic. Locally, the green iron silicate grains are flattened and deformed in particular beds, indicating they must have been soft and plastic during compaction. The proportion of green iron silicate minerals in these beds is generally high, but not high enough to merit the name greensand.  Sedimentary structures in the lower Chiall Formation include parallel lamination, load casts, and minor cross-lamination. These are overlain by symmetrical and asymmetrical ripples, rills, wrinkle marks, and contorted bedding, which are overall more common sedimentary structures in the lower Chiall Formation. Most are indicative of shallow to very shallow water conditions, with occasional emergence.  Fine- to medium-grained sandstone-dominated units in the Chiall Formation form prominent topographic ridges in the central areas of the basin. Textural and compositional maturity increases stratigraphically upwards in fine- to medium-grained sandstone. Sandstone beds predominantly comprise subrounded to rounded quartz, minor chert, feldspar and glauconite, and accessory zircon and tourmaline. Glauconite is generally concentrated at the base of fine- to medium-grained sandstone-dominated units, suggesting placer deposition and concentration after depositional hiatuses when grains grew on or near the sea floor . In units mapped as fine to medium-grained glauconitic sandstone, the proportion of glauconite is generally much higher than in other fine to medium grained sandstone units in the Chiall Formation. The contact between the Chiall Formation and the underlying Frere Formation is variable laterally. In general, it is taken as the top of the last major chert bed or iron-formation. In the north, the lower part of the Chiall Formation consists of a thick succession of shale, siltstone and mudstone, which has been assigned to the Karri Karri Member. Where the Windidda Member of the Frere Formation is present, the contact is taken as the top of the last carbonate bed. In the central part of WONGAWOL, the base of the Chiall Formation consists of very fine to fine-grained sandstone, siltstone, shale, and mudstone. South of the Princess Range, the base of the formation is commonly conglomeratic, which led Bunting (1986) to interpret the boundary as a disconformity. Conglomerate at the base of the Chiall Formation increases in abundance to the east southeast, and is texturally variable, consisting of poorly-sorted boulder conglomerate and pebble conglomerate. Clasts are locally imbricate and clast type is variable and commonly reflects the underlying lithologies, suggesting a strong local source control. Fine-grained sandstone, siltstone, and carbonate are the dominant clast types with the proportion varying both vertically and along strike. Poorly sorted boulder conglomerate is generally laterally restricted and is weakly bedded. Clasts vary from subrounded to angular, but are typically angular. 5 km northwest of Kepaltin Spring (on WONGAWOL) poorly sorted, boulder conglomerate is up to 4 m thick and consists of angular lath-like clasts of dominantly microbial carbonate reworked from the Windidda Member below, and minor sandstone, in a coarse-grained sandstone matrix containing glauconite peloids and cemented by ferruginous clay (Jones, 2004). Pebble conglomerate beds, which are interbedded with siltstone, mudstone and glauconitic very fine and fine-grained sandstone at the base of the Chiall Formation, are typically less than 50 cm thick.  It is important to recognize that basal conglomerate in the Chiall Formation is relatively restricted laterally, and mostly overlies carbonates of the Windidda Member. This could reflect rapid lithification of carbonates, or their more resistant nature compared to siltstone. There is little other evidence to support a significant break in sedimentation between the two. The contact between the Chiall Formation and the Windidda Member commonly appears transitional, except for localized exposures of cobble conglomerate, and reflects a change from carbonate-cemented conglomerate to conglomerate with a sandstone matrix. There could nonetheless be a significant disconformity. ","The Chiall Formation was deposited in shallow shelfal to coastal, low to moderate energy conditions, based on primary sedimentary structures such as load casts, ripple morphology, and wrinkle marked surfaces, and the widespread presence of glauconite. Wrinkled surfaces and interference to laddered ripples indicate intermittent emergence.",1000,1500,,,,17,,,,4,,,,1876,19,1650,,"Halilovic et al. (2004) determined a maximum depositional age of 1876 Ma for the Chiall Formation from detrital zircons within a single sample, but Sheppard et al. (in prep.) doubted the validity of the data. In two samples from the Granite Peak area, Matonia (2009) recovered only grains older than about 2100 Ma. Nonetheless, the Chaill Formation is less than about 1890 Ma old, the age of tuffaceous beds near the base of the underlying Frere Formation (Rasmussen et al., 2012).   The minimum age of the Chiall Formation is constrained by a Ar/Ar age of about 1650 Ma on metamorphic mica in deformed Tooloo Group (Pirajno et al., 2009). It may be further constrained by an age of about 1815 Ma for authigenic monazite in the Yelma Formation (Muhling et al., 2012), if these are the result of fluid flow during deformation of the entire Earaheedy basin succession (as Sheppard et al., written comm., suggested) rather than earlier fluid flow associated with mineralization in the Yelma Formation.",No,,,4,,No,DE in Progress,No,Yes,P_,EMc,,,,,MIGSDRH,2.02E+13,,No,No

It was deposited in a narrow, north-northeasterly trending basin west of the Lawlers Anticline and the Mount White Syncline in the northwestern part of the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane in the Yilgarn Craton. It comprises polymictic conglomerate, which contains abundant mafic and ultramafic clasts at the base, with progressively more felsic clasts towards the top. The matrix is rich in chlorite and actinolite. The Claudius Member is unconformably underlain by various formations of the Kalgoorlie and Mount White Groups.","The Claudius Member extends broadly north-south along the Emu Shear Zone for about 33 km, approximately between the Nineteen Mile Well in the north and Mount Mcauley in the south. It is about 100 m thick to the west of the Lawlers Anticline and up to 1100 m thick to the west of the Mount White Syncline. It is about 350 m thick on the western limb of the Scotty Creek Syncline, where it extends between Hanson Well and the New Holland mine.","The Claudius Member is named after Claudius Creek, which lies about 22 km to the southwest of the townsite of Lawlers.",,"The Claudius Member consists mainly of polymictic conglomerate with minor interbedded sandstone. The conglomerate contains dominantly mafic and ultramafic clasts in a chlorite-actinolite-rich matrix near the contact with the Agnew Komatiite. The proportion of felsic clasts (mainly tonalite) increases towards the upper part of the Claudius Member (Platt et al., 1978; Beardsmore, 2002; Duuring et al., 2012). Hypidiomorphic granular texture is well preserved in less-deformed tonalite clasts (Platt et al., 1978). The Claudius Member in the western limb of the Scotty Creek Syncline contains dominantly felsic clasts with subordinate mafic clasts in a chlorite-actinolite-rich matrix (Beardsmore, 2002).","The Claudius Member probably represents alluvial fan deposits (Beardsmore, 2002) that formed in a narrow north-northeasterly trending basin on the western flanks of the Lawlers Anticline and the Mount White Syncline. Clasts at the base of this unit were largely derived from the Agnew Komatiite, one of the lowermost units of the Two Sisters Hill Subgroup. Continued uplift, coinciding with the deposition of the Claudius Member, exposed lower mafic units of the Two Sisters Subgroup and the felsic rocks that core the Lawlers Anticline, as indicated by increasing proportion of tonalite clasts towards the upper part of the Claudius Member.",,1100,,"The Claudius Member unconformably overlies various mafic-ultramafic units of the Two Sisters Subgroup where it is adjacent to the Lawlers Anticline, and sedimentary units of the Mount White Group where it is adjacent to the Mount White Syncline. This unconformable contact is strongly deformed by the Emu Shear Zone. Beardsmore (2002) described the Emu Shear Zone as a near-vertical transpressional system with a dextral component of movement. A deep-crustal seismic traverse through the area showed the Emu Shear Zone to be a steeply west-dipping structure, which may be linked to the nearby Waroonga Shear Zone (Zibra et al., 2014). The Claudius Member gradually passes upwards into the sandstone-dominated component of the Scotty Creek Formation.

It unconformably overlies Mesoproterozoic rocks of the Musgrave region, and is overlain, presumably unconformably, by glacigene rocks of the Permo-Carboniferous Paterson Formation. It was deposited in fluvial to estuarine and marginal marine environments. The estuarine to marginal marine facies contain common trace fossils and fossil fish. Detrital zircon geochronology indicates an Ordovician, or younger age, while fish fossils are most likely of Late Ordovician age. The Cobb Formation may correlate with the subsurface Carribuddy Group of the southern Canning Basin.","The Cobb Formation is restricted to the Cobb Embayment of the Canning Basin. Sparse exposures are found on the DICKINSON, GUNBARREL and DEERING map sheets, with extensions interpreted under cover on southern RAWLINSON and southwest MOUNT BUTTFIELD. The thickness of the unit is poorly constrained due to the sparse nature of outcrop, but individual outcrops do not expose more than 30 m of section at most. A water bore (D59) on the Wingellina Road intersected 121 m of sedimentary sequence to bottom of hole (Farbridge, 1967, 1968). This is interpreted as Cobb Formation and gives a minimum thickness. A seismic line along the Great Central Road suggests that the Cobb Formation may be at least several hundred metres thick, but the base of the succession is not well defined.","The Cobb Formation is named after Lake Cobb (MGA Zone 52 222000E 7322000N), and the Cobb Embayment of the Canning Basin, within which the unit is situated. It was previously included in an unnamed unit of assumed Permian age on the Scott 1:250 000 geological map by Daniels (1972), and was later assigned to the Paterson Formation along with all other fill of the Cobb Embayment by Hocking (1994). The type locality is an east-facing scarp 23.4 km ENE of Wanarn Community, and 10.4 km north of the Great Central Road (MGA Zone 52 375480E 7210000N), which exposes an estimated 30 m of section.

A thin (~10 cm) grey silty dolomite bed is exposed near the base of the exposure. The sandstone is locally pebbly, with rare lenses of polymict conglomerate. Trace fossils and fragmentary fish fossils are locally common.  Exposures in gravel quarries along the Great Central Road consist of deeply weathered, poorly-sorted, feldspathic and arkosic pebbly sandstone and local siltstone. Possible trace fossils are present in sandstone at one site.  At hilly exposures approximately 26 km west and 30 km southwest of Warakurna Roadhouse the Cobb Formations consists of very weathered, coarse-grained, cross-bedded, pebbly arkose, and more quartz-rich medium- to coarse-grained pebbly sandstone. Minor reddish or purplish siltstone interbeds are present, but poorly exposed. Poorly preserved possible trace fossils are present, but rare. Finer-grained horizons may locally preserve halite pseudomorphs.  The basal ~6 m of the Cobb Formation is exposed at PWHCOB000031 (MGA Zone 52 435337E 7219348N) where it unconformably overlies saprolitic granite of the Warakurna Supersuite.

In the southeast Gascoyne Platform, it oversteps the Yaringa Formation and upper Ajana Formation to rest directly on the lowermost unit of the Dirk Hartog Group, the Marron Member of the Ajana Formation. The Coburn Formation consists of limestone and dolomite ranging from mudstone to grainstone, arranged in a series of coarsening-upward shoaling cycles, and is Late Silurian based on conodont faunas. In the fully cored Coburn 1 it is the coarsest grained part of the Dirk Hartog Group. Shoaling upwards cycles are present at scales ranging from a few metres to tens of metres, as is common in platform carbonate successions. They grade upwards from wackestone and packstone to grainstone, with dolomite and evaporitic textures and content (as disseminated grains, nodules and veins) more common in the upper parts of cycles, within grainstone intervals.  The type section of the Coburn Formation is in Hamelin Pool 1 between 951 and 1225 m  (274 m). The thickest intersections are 335 and 295 m in Pendock 1 and Dirk Hartog 17B respectively, but both have eroded tops, and so are minimum deposited thicknesses.

1133,79565,A-_ck-xmu-b,1,Cock Robin Formation,1,"Tremolite schist, basalt and fuchsiteâ€“andalusite schist","The Cock Robin Formation in the west-central part of the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane in the Yilgarn Craton has an estimated age of 2817-2753 Ma. It is structurally juxtaposed to much younger rocks of the Highway Formation (Broad Arrow Subgroup) around the township of Menzies. The formation contains a diverse range of lithologies that include ultramafic schist, fuchsite-quartz-andalusite schist, komatiitic basalt, basalt, amphibolite, slate, and banded chert. The ultramafic schist is inferred to have derived from komatiite and consists of an assemblage of fine- to medium-grained tremolite and/or chlorite with minor talc. The fuchsite-quartz-andalusite schist, which overlies the ultramafic schist, may have resulted from hydrothermal alteration of komatiite. The basalt consists of actinolite-tremolite after pyroxene and altered plagioclase with minor epidote, quartz, and opaque minerals. The komatiitic basalt is characterized by variolitic or relict pyroxene-spinifex textures. The amphibolite is composed of preferentially aligned amphibole, fine recrystallized plagioclase, and local poikiloblastic garnet with very fine elongate opaque minerals or titanite. The slate is a minor component of the Cock Robin Formation and commonly silicified. Banded and pyritic chert with local banded iron-formation is distinguished by a strong positive aeromagnetic anomaly. Various historical mine workings and current exploration projects for gold and nickel mineralization are located within the extent of the Cock Robin Formation.  The age of the Cock Robin Formation is unknown but its lithological assemblage is similar to the Trevors Bore and Mount Leonora Formations to the north, and has been deformed with the c. 2803 Ma Twin Hills Monzogranite.","The Cock Robin Formation is a northerly trending unit that has been mapped from west of Split Rock Well (Zone 51, MGA 318641E 6750037N) in the north on MELITA to Kings Bore (Zone 51, MGA 315532E 6705507N) in the south on MENZIES. It is extensively intruded by granite and most extensively exposed southeast of the township of Menzies.","The Cock Robin Formation is named after Cock Robin Well (Zone 51, MGA 318025E 6724727N), which is located about 13 km northeast of the township of Menzies. Outcrops between the township of Menzies in the west and near Piccadilly Well (Zone 51, MGA 320774E 6710360N) in the east, where various components of the Cock Robin Formation are exposed, represent the type locality for the formation. ",,"The Cock Robin Formation comprises ultramafic schist, fuchsite-quartz-andalusite schist, komatiitic basalt, basalt, amphibolite, slate, and banded chert.   The ultramafic schist, which is believed to be a metamorphic equivalent of komatiite in upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies, consists of an assemblage of fine- to medium-grained tremolite and/or chlorite with minor talc. Its MgO content varies between 18 and 25% (Martyn and Johnson, 1986; Swager, 1994). The fuchsite-quartz-andalusite schist and the underlying ultramafic schist are characterized by a similar immobile trace element pattern, based on which Martyn and Johnson (1986) inferred that the fuchsite-quartz-andalusite schist could have resulted from a large-scale hydrothermal alteration of komatiite that removed almost all Ca, Mg, Fe, Na, and Ni from the host rock, but retained Al, Cr, Ti, and V and added a large amount of SiO2.  The fuchsite-quartz-andalusite schist is distinctly bright green in colour. Quartz and fuchsite are commonly fine grained and andalusite is poikiloblastic. Common accessory minerals include rutile and chromite. The schist records two to three phases of deformation (Swager, 1994).  The basalt is composed actinolite-tremolite after primary pyroxene and altered plagioclase with minor epidote, chlorite, quartz, and opaque minerals. Vesicles and plagioclase phenocrysts are preserved locally. The komatiitic basalt displays variolitic and relict pyroxene-spinifex textures. The varioles are ovoid, cream to white, and locally more plagioclase-rich than the matrix (Swager, 1994). Primary pyroxene needles are replaced by actinolite-tremolite. The matrix is formed by prismatic amphibole after pyroxene and minor altered interstitial plagioclase.  The amphibolite consists of preferentially aligned, fine- to medium-grained amphibole, fine-grained, recrystallized plagioclase, and very fine-grained, elongate opaque minerals and/or titanite (Swager, 1994; Witt, 1994). Mafic minerals (actinolite-hornblende) and plagioclase-quartz may form alternating bands (Libby, 1987). Locally preserved lath-shaped plagioclase in the amphibolite suggests a basaltic origin. The amphibolite exposed about 400 m northwest of Goodenough mine (Zone 51, MGA 313983E 6715455N) contains strongly poikiloblastic garnets.  Grey to black slate is a minor component of the Cock Robin Formation that extends from west of Jowetts Well (Zone 51, MGA 314641E 6712588N) to east of the township of Menzies. It is commonly silicified and displays intrafolial folding locally.  Banded and pyritic chert within the Cock Robin Formation is evident in aeromagnetic data by a strong positive anomaly. The chert contains banded iron-formation locally (Martyn and Johnson, 1986; Swager, 1994).  Several historical mine workings and current exploration projects, particularly for gold, are located within the Cock Robin Formation. The Twin Hills mine (Zone 51, MGA 317861E 6740867N), which lies about 28 km northeast of the township of Menzies produced 1100 t of gold-bearing ore at an average grade of 23.6 g/t (Golden Deeps NL, 1998). Gold mineralization at Granny Venn (Zone 51, MGA 315324E 6716916N) and Auntie Nellie (Zone 51, MGA 315072E 6716355N) mine pits is associated with porphyritic granodiorite lenses in ultramafic schist (O'Farrell, 2009).",,,,,"The Cock Robin Formation is structurally juxtaposed to the Highway Formation (A-KGhw-xu-b) of the Broad Arrow Subgroup (A-KGB-xb-u) and is intruded by various granitic bodies, such as the Jorgenson Monzogranite (A-_jo-gm) and the Oliver Twist Granodiorite (A-_ot-gg).

It was deposited following a major marine transgression that led to deep-marine shelf sedimentation (lower Backdoor Formation) prevailing across the region. This was followed by a period of delta progradation (upper Backdoor Formation and Calyie Formation), and finally by delta abandonment and a return to deep-marine shelf conditions (Ilgarari Formation). The Collier Group has a maximum thickness of about 4400 m. It outcrops in the Wanna Syncline on EDMUND, ELLIOTT CREEK, KENNETH RANGE, and PEEDAWARRA, TEANO, north of the Mount Vernon Fault on MOUNT VERNON and TANGADEE, in the Tangadee and Noss Synclines on TANGADEE, in the Beasley, Backdoor Hills, Calyie, Cherry, Collier Range, Jaydinia, the Mindi Synclines, and the Dunlop and Jamindi Anticlines on CALYIE, JAMINDI, MILGUN, THREE RIVERS, and CARDAWAN. It is also present in the Lofty Range Syncline on LOFTY RANGE and ILGARARI, in the Brumby Creek and Glen Ross Anticlines, southeast of the Nuninga Spring Faults on LOFTY RANGE, the adjacent part on ILGARARI, and is widely distributed throughout WONYULGUNNA. The Collier Group unconformably overlies Archean to Paleoproterozoic rocks of the Pilbara Craton and Marymia Inlier and the Archean to Paleoproterozoic Fortescue, Hamersley, Bryah, Earaheedy, and Scorpion Groups. It also has an unconformable, low angle contact with the Mesoproterozoic Edmund Group. It is unconformably overlain by either the ?Late Mesoproterozoic Salvation Group or the Neoproterozoic Sunbeam Group (Officer Basin). The age of the Collier Group is poorly constrained, but it was probably deposited between c. 1171 and 1067 Ma.","The Collier Group outcrops in the Wanna Syncline on EDMUND, ELLIOTT CREEK, KENNETH RANGE, PEEDAWARRA, TEANO, north of the Mount Vernon Fault on MOUNT VERNON and TANGADEE, in the Tangadee and Noss Synclines on TANGADEE, in the Beasley, Backdoor Hills, Calyie, Cherry, Collier Range, Jaydinia, the Mindi Synclines, and the Dunlop and Jamindi Anticlines on CALYIE, JAMINDI, MILGUN, THREE RIVERS, and CARDAWAN.

The group generally ranges in thickness from 2000-2700 m on EDMUND, ELLIOTT CREEK, KENNETH RANGE, and PEEDAWARRA, and to about 900-1200 m on eastern MOUNT VERNON and TANGADEE. In the Lofty Range Syncline and southern ILGARARI, the succession thickens from 1600 to 4400 m and is up to 4200 m thick in the Jaydinia Syncline on WONYULGUNNA. The group is about 2000 m thick around the eastern closure of the Calyie Syncline on CARDAWAN, but thickens to about 4000 m around its western closure on CALYIE. The succession may be as much as 7000 m thick on JAMINDI (Cutten et al., 2013), although this anomalous thickness may be due to a combination of structural repetition and limited exposure in parts of this area.","The Collier Subgroup was named by Muhling and Brakel (1985) on the 1:250 000 map sheet COLLIER and equated to the Mucalana Subgroup and the upper part of the Edmund Subgroup on EDMUND and TUREE CREEK (Muhling and Brakel, 1985; Williams, 1990). Part of the upper Collier Subgroup was subsequently placed in the former Savory Group by Williams (1992), whereas the Mucalana Subgroup was incorporated into the Collier Subgroup by Cooper et al. (1998). The Collier Subgroup was elevated to the Collier Group by Martin et al. (1999) and Martin and Thorne (2002). As a result of these changes, the Mucalana Subgroup has been abandoned and its various formation names discarded in favour of their Collier Group equivalents. The Collier Group is subdivided, in stratigraphically ascending order, into the Backdoor, Calyie, and Ilgarari Formations. It is partly equivalent to the Manganese, Kahrban, and Diebil Subgroups of Muhling and Brakel (1985), and possibly equivalent to the Oldham Sandstone on TRAINOR (Hocking et al., 2000).  Martin and Thorne (2004) and Martin et al. (2008) used the term 'depositional package' in order to describe the tectonic evolution of the Edmund and Collier Basins and the depositional settings for the Edmund and Collier Groups. Under this scheme, the 14 lithostratigraphic formations of the Edmund and Collier Groups are arranged into six depositional packages, which represent discrete stages in basin development. The lower packages make up the Edmund Group and consist of (in ascending order): Depositional package 1 (Yilgatherra and Irregully Formations), Depositional package 2 (Gooragoora, Blue Billy, and Cheyne Springs Formations), Depositional package 3 (Kiangi Creek and Muntharra Formations), and Depositional package 4 (Discovery, Devil Creek, Ullawarra, and Coodardoo Formations). The remaining two packages, namely Depositional package 5 (Backdoor and Calyie Formations) and Depositional package 6 (Ilgarari Formation) make up the Collier Group.  A type area for the former Collier Subgroup was not defined by Muhling and Brakel (1985). It is well exposed in the Wanna Syncline on EDMUND and TUREE CREEK, on the 1:250 000 map sheet MOUNT EGERTON, on the 1:250 000 map sheet COLLIER around the Mount Vernon Fault and Calyie Syncline, in the Jamindi Anticline and Thompson Fault area, in the Lofty Range, and the Jamindi Synclines.",,"The Collier Group is a predominantly siliciclastic sedimentary unit made up (in stratigraphically ascending order) of the Backdoor, Calyie, and Ilgarari Formations.

(2008) used the term 'depositional package' in order to describe the tectonic evolution of the Edmund and Collier Basins. Under this scheme, the 14 lithostratigraphic formations of the Bangemall Supergroup are arranged into six depositional packages, which represent discrete stages in basin development. The lower packages make up the Edmund Group and consist of (in stratigraphically ascending order): Depositional package 1 (Yilgatherra and Irregully Formations), Depositional package 2 (Gooragoora, Blue Billy, and Cheyne Springs Formations), Depositional package 3 (Kiangi Creek and Muntharra Formations), and Depositional package 4 (Discovery, Devil Creek, Ullawarra, and Coodardoo Formations). The remaining two packages, viz. Depositional package 5 (Backdoor and Calyie Formations) and Depositional package 6 (Ilgarari Formation), make up the Collier Group.  Each depositional package consists of an assemblage of genetically related strata, with a basal contact that is either a regional unconformity or a major flooding surface (Martin and Thorne, 2004). As such, the depositional packages do not correspond exactly with either unconformity-bounded sequences (ISSC, 1987) or the sequence stratigraphic units of Vail et al. (1977). As for the former, a subdivision based on the presence of basal unconformities would be too broad, whereas a terminology based on the latter suggests a basin evolution related to cyclic changes of global sea level, and by implication, an order of duration for each unit. At present, the stratigraphic and geochronological framework for the Bangemall Supergroup is based on regional lithological mapping, and is not sufficiently detailed to attempt a rigorous sequence stratigraphic analysis. Such an analysis is further hindered by three factors. Firstly, the predominance of fine-grained lithofacies south of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system, which were deposited below storm wave base, secondly, the volume of dolerite intrusions, and thirdly, the degree of deformation. However, the depositional packages are broadly similar in style and approximate duration to the supersequences of Vail et al. (1977) and other workers. Each package records an upward-shallowing basin filling event, and commonly reflects a significant change in paleogeography (Martin and Thorne, 2004).",,"Depositional package 5 is a predominantly siliciclastic sedimentary unit made up of two formations, viz. the Backdoor Formation at the base and the Calyie Formation at the top.

This was followed by a major marine transgression that led to deep-marine shelf conditions (lower Backdoor Formation), prevailing across the entire region (Martin and Thorne, 2004). Increased amounts of sandy detritus were then deposited during the progradation of a major delta complex (upper Backdoor Formation and Calyie Formation) that built out across the region from the east and southeast.  Facies distributions in the carbonates and paleocurrent data from sandstones in the Backdoor Formation on ELLIOTT CREEK and KENNETH RANGE indicate a southwesterly sloping sea floor that was probably a remnant of pre-Package 5 tilting. Further to the east on TANGADEE and CALYIE, the data suggests a more westerly directed flow. Deltaic facies in the Calyie Formation thicken from around 200 to 300 m in north and northwestern parts of the basin, between TANGADEE and ELLIOTT CREEK, to 1000 to 2000 m in the southeast on CALYIE, CARDAWAN, JAMINDI, THREE RIVERS, LOFTY RANGE, ILGARARI, and WONYULGUNNA.

It is exposed in the core of the Wanna Syncline on ELLIOTT CREEK, KENNETH RANGE, and PEEDAWARRA, the area north of the Mount Vernon Fault on TEANO, MOUNT VERNON, and TANGADEE, and in the Calyie, Mindi, Lion North, Lion South, and Beasley Synclines on CALYIE, JAMINDI, THREE RIVERS, and CARDAWAN. It is also present in the Lofty Range Syncline on LOFTY RANGE and ILGARARI, northern and southern ILGARARI, and in the core of the Jaydinia Syncline on WONYULGUNNA. The package has a conformable lower contact with Depositional package 5 and an unconformable upper contact with Phanerozoic regolith deposits. The age of Depositional package 6 is poorly constrained, but it was probably deposited between c. 1171 and 1067 Ma.","Depositional package 6 is exposed in the core of the Wanna Syncline on ELLIOTT CREEK, KENNETH RANGE, and PEEDAWARRA, the area north of the Mount Vernon Fault on TEANO, MOUNT VERNON, and TANGADEE, and in the Calyie, Mindi, Lion North, Lion South, and Beasley Synclines on CALYIE, JAMINDI, THREE RIVERS, and CARDAWAN. It is also present in the Lofty Range Syncline on LOFTY RANGE and ILGARARI, northern and southern ILGARARI, and in the core of the Jaydinia Syncline on WONYULGUNNA. The true thickness of the package is difficult to measure because the upper contact is not exposed and the succession is intruded by numerous dolerite sills. In the Wanna Syncline on ELLIOTT CREEK, Martin et al. (1999) estimate it to be 680 m thick. Farther east in the area north of the Mount Vernon Fault, the succussion is estimated to be 250-400 m thick. In the Lofty Range Syncline on southern ILGARARI the package is 500900 m thick, and in the core of the Jaydinia Syncline on WONYULGUNNA its thickness is ~400 m. The thickest sections are in the Calyie, Mindi, and Beasley Synclines, where the package is estimated to measure 1400-1500 m.","Martin and Thorne (2004) and Martin et al. (2008) used the term 'depositional package' in order to describe the tectonic evolution of the Edmund and Collier Basins. Under this scheme, the 14 lithostratigraphic formations of the Bangemall Supergroup are arranged into six depositional packages, which represent discrete stages in basin development. The lower packages make up the Edmund Group and consist of (in stratigraphically ascending order): Depositional package 1 (Yilgatherra and Irregully Formations), Depositional package 2 (Gooragoora, Blue Billy, and Cheyne Springs Formations), Depositional package 3 (Kiangi Creek and Muntharra Formations), and Depositional package 4 (Discovery, Devil Creek, Ullawarra, and Coodardoo Formations). The remaining two packages, viz. Depositional package 5 (Backdoor and Calyie Formations) and Depositional package 6 (Ilgarari Formation) make up the Collier Group.   Each depositional package consists of an assemblage of genetically related strata, with a basal contact that is either a regional unconformity or a major flooding surface (Martin and Thorne, 2004). As such, the depositional packages do not correspond exactly with either unconformity-bounded sequences (ISSC, 1987) or the sequence stratigraphic units of Vail et al. (1977). As for the former, a subdivision based on the presence of basal unconformities would be too broad, whereas a terminology based on the latter suggests a basin evolution related to cyclic changes of global sea level and, by implication, an order of duration for each unit. At present, the stratigraphic and geochronological framework for the Bangemall Supergroup is based on regional lithological mapping, and is not detailed enough to attempt a rigorous sequence stratigraphic analysis. Such an analysis is further hindered by three factors. Firstly, the predominance of fine-grained lithofacies south of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system, which were deposited below storm wave base, secondly, the volume of dolerite intrusions, and thirdly, the degree of deformation.However, the depositional packages are broadly similar in style and approximate duration to the supersequences of Vail et al. (1977) and other workers. Each package records an upward-shallowing basin filling event, and commonly reflects a significant change in paleogeography (Martin and Thorne, 2004).",,"Depositional package 6 is a fine-grained, predominantly siliciclastic sedimentary unit composed of siltstone and fine-grained sandstone of the Ilgarari Formation (P_-MCi-sl), together with minor chert and limestone. A relatively thick chert body on southeastern CALYIE and northeastern JAMINDI and has been mapped as a separate member (P_-MCi-cl) of the Ilgarari Formation. The package is generally poorly exposed and silicified and is intruded by numerous mafic sills of the c. 1075 Ma Kulkatharra Dolerite.","Depositional package 6 was probably deposited in a generally anoxic, relatively deep-marine environment that received only minor amounts of fine-grained, sand-sized detritus. The package records a deepening of the Collier Basin and a regional flooding event that terminated the major period of delta progradation in the upper part of Depositional package 5 (Martin and Thorne, 2004).",,1500,,"Depositional package 6 has a sharp, conformable lower contact with the Calyie Formation at the top of Depositional package 5. Depositional package 6 is the highest tectono-stratigraphic package in the Collier Basin, but its contact with the overlying ?Late Mesoproterozoic Salvation Group and the Neoproterozoic Sunbeam Group (Officer Basin) is not exposed. Instead, the package has an unconformable upper contact with Phanerozoic regolith deposits.",,8,,,,3,,,,1171,,1067,,"The age of Depositional package 6 is poorly constrained, but is probably between c. 1171 and 1067 Ma. The older age limit is provided by structural relationships,which suggest that the package was not affected by the 1321-1171 Ma Mutherbukin Tectonic Event (Korhonen et al., 2017). The younger age limit for the group comes from mafic sills of the 1084-1067 Ma Kulkatharra Dolerite, that is part of the c. 1075 Ma Warakurna Large Igneous Province (Wingate et al., 2002; Wingate et al., 2004), which intrude the succession. Martin (2003) recorded the presence of a peperite margin along the contact between a mafic sill of Kulkatharra Dolerite and lithic quartz wacke of the Backdoor Formation on KENNETH RANGE. This suggests that locally the Kulkatharra Dolerite may have intruded into unlithified or semilithified sediment relatively close to the younger age limit of c. 1067 Ma.",No,,,1,,No,Published,No,Yes,P_,MCP6,,,,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

It has been identified extensively around the Kambalda dome as far as Tramways, and to the west in a parallel greenstone belt. The unit has a chilled base and basal cumulate pyroxenite, which grades up into gabbro and dolerite. The upper third of the dolerite comprises granophyre, which is the doinant host for gold mineralization in this formation.","There are several mafic sills at the level of the Paringa Basalt - Black Flag Group contact, or within stratified metasedimentary rocks at base of the Black Flag Group near Kambalda (Zone 51, MGA 372850E, 6547500N). Outcrops and diamond-drill core has identified mafic intrusive rocks on both limbs, and nose of the south southeast-plunging Kambalda Anticline. To the west, in a parallel north-northwesterly trending belt, the dolerite has been identified at Joanna Dam, near Cave Rocks (Zone 51, MGA 362615E, 6546250N), and southward to region of Pilbailey Hill (Zone 51, MGA 365635E, 6533000N). A mafic sill located at the site of the Junction openpit and underground mine (Zone 51, MGA 389530E, 6519100) has previously been named the Junction Dolerite (e.g. Roberts 1988; Swager et al., 1995; Neumayr et al., 2004) The past designation of the 'Junction Dolerite' has not been retained here. On the basis of stratigraphic position and geochemistry (Carey, 1994; McGoldrick et al., 2013) the mafic sill at the Junction mine is now considered to be part of the Condenser Dolerite. The Condenser Dolerite has been considered by several authors to be a lateral equivalent of the Golden Mile Dolerite (e.g. Neumayr et al., 2004; Weinberg et al., 2005; McGoldrick et al., 2013). ","The name is probably taken from the term 'condenser', which were devices used extensively on the Goldfields to desalinate water before the building of the pipeline from Perth.",,"The Condenser Dolerite is an iron-rich tholeiitic, differentiated sill (Carey 1994; McGoldrick et al., 2013). Carey (1994), using core from the Argo (Zone 51, MGA 383820E, 6525765N) and Junction mine sites, divided the sill in to four zones, using the alteration assemblages, mineral geochemistry and relict textures.        Zone 1: t the base, is a weak cumulate-textured zone comprising 60% amphibole-chlorite after pyroxene, olivine, and saussuritized intercumulus plagioclase. The dominant oxide phase is ilmenite.   Zone 2: there is a graduated transition to zone 2 from zone, with a decrease in mafic minerals (45-50%) and the appearance of titanomagnetite. Carey (1994) mentions orthopyroxene (equant habit) and clinopyroxene (bladed habit) are both present in zone 2, but with continued crystallization clinopyroxene becomes more abundant up section. Plagioclase also has two habits, that of an intercumulus phase and as distinct laths. A weak microrhythmic layering may be present in the adcumulus sections.   Zone 3: the transition from zone 2 can be both sharp and graduated (a feature also noted by McGoldrick et al., 2013). This zone is a quartz-plagioclase granophyre. The quartz has a bluish hue, and where there are higher concentrations of the felsic phases the matrix has a bluish-grey colour. Plagioclase (albite) and secondary amphibole after pyroxene have a coarse bladed texture. There is a strong increase in magnetic susceptibility, with both magnetite and ilmenite co-existing.   Zone 4 is a gabbronorite. A diffuse transition from zone 3 to 4 is marked by the decrease in quartz and alkali feldspar, and the habit of the pseudomorphs becoming less elongate. Saussuritized plagioclase comprises 45-50% of the zone, and as with Zone 2 is both interstitial and lath-like. Ilmenite (2-5%) is the dominate opaque with subordinate titanate and rutile. The grain size decreases towards the margin where it is chilled.    <div>McGoldrick et al. (2013) also looked at core from the Argo and Junction sites, and had a similar zonation to that described above. Broadly, they show a sequence from a basal chilled margin to aphyric basalt, transitioning to equigranular clinopyroxene-bearing dolerite to bladed clinopyroxene-bearing gabbro. The upper third of the sill was recorded as a quartz-rich granophyre, changing to a gabbro and dolerite before the upper aphyric basalt and chilled margin. The characteristic alteration assemblage for the sill is described by Carey (1994) as amphibole-chlorite-epidote-plagioclase-quartz with subordinate titanium-bearing iron oxides, carbonate and K-mica. Gold mineralization is preferentially associated with the granophyric zones.</div>",,,500,,"The basal and upper contacts of the Condenser Dolerite are typically represented by sharp, fine, chilled contacts with the lower Black Flag Group. McGoldrick et al. (2013) have identified rare pillow forms at the upper margin (Argo drill core), suggesting an extrusive outpouring contemporaneous with sub-volcanic sill emplacement. This supports the interpretation of the Athena Basalt as a subaerial expression of the Condenser Dolerite.",,17,,,,4,,,,2680,8,2680,8,"Carey (1994) sampled a felsic pegmatitic zone of the dolerite from drill core (CD501, Zone 51, 382006.53E, 6526792.69, datum not supplied) near the Argo mine for suitable magmatic zircons. From 20 analyses on 20 zircon grains, 15 concordant results were combined to yield a U-Pb SHRIMP age of 2680 Â± 8 Ma. This age was interpreted to be the age of magmatic crystallization.   Squire et al. (2010) provide supporting evidence for the c. 2860 Ma age of intrusion, when they used detrital zircons from the matrix of a massive monomict conglomerate adjacent to the dolerite near Argo.

2987,78533,A-_cg-mgn,1,Connolly Gneiss,1,Biotiteâ€“muscovite granitic gneiss; medium grained,"The Connolly Gneiss is a complexly deformed granitic gneiss with banding defined by relative abundance of biotite. It lies in the western part of the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane on southern YILMIA. The gneiss has a complex intrusion history with prominent age components at c. 2801 Ma and c. 2668 Ma. It has been extensively intruded by quartz veins, and pegmatite and aplite dykes.","The Connolly Gneiss lies south-southeast of the Coolgardie township and west of the Kambalda township, along the western side of the greenstone succession. It has been mapped over an area of about 45 km from north to south and 30 km from east to west on YILMIA. It forms sparse outcrops and its distribution has been determined based partly on aeromagnetic images.","The Connolly Gneiss derives its name from the Connolly locality, which was a railway siding on the abandoned narrow-gauge railway line, about 30 km southeast of the historic Londonderry townsite (Zone 51, MGA 320918E 6560684N). The name was first used by Cassidy et al. (2002).   The type locality for the Connolly Gneiss is a geochronology sample locality (Zone 51, MGA 338995E 6535615N), about 1.5 km southwest of the Connolly locality. ",,"The following description is derived mainly from Hunter (1991). The Connolly Gneiss has persistent bimodal banding, with biotite-rich and quartzo-feldspathic components. The biotite-rich bands, which range in thickness from one to several centimetres, are medium grained. The bands are homogeneous except for small feldspathic clots that may have been phenocrysts. Biotite grains lie parallel to the banding. There are pinch-and-swell structures and local discordant orientations, but generally the bands lie in subparallel bundles. The gneiss is mainly monzogranitic and granodioritic in composition (GSWA 63534, 63535; Libby, 1984).   Thin aplite, pegmatite and quartz veins, with various orientations, intruded the Connolly Gneiss prior to deformation (GSWA 63536; Libby, 1984). Where veins were originally at a low angle to banding, they have been rotated close to sub-parallel to banding to produce a finer, dispersed component of dark and light banding within dark bands, or pale, biotite-free stringers within light bands. Where veins were at a high angle to banding, deformation has produced harmonic to disharmonic folds. There are thin, biotite-rich reaction rims along the margins of some larger feldspathic veins. Some biotite-rich stringers that cut the banding are relics of mafic dykes.  In quartzo-feldspathic bands, quartz, feldspar and minor amounts of biotite have a preferred elongation that creates a streaky augen texture. Scattered feldspathic augen within these bands indicate that the protolith may have been porphyritic. The streaky gneissosity is typically subparallel to compositional banding, but it is in some places discordant. West of Connolly, the dark bands cut chevron folds in the gneiss.  At Quairnie Rock (Zone 51, MGA 317135E 6539622N), Dunphy et al. (2003) described light grey, fine- to medium-grained, seriate, biotite-bearing monzogranite, which contains less than 5% biotite, that is interlayered with grey, fine- to medium-grained, equigranular to seriate, granite that contains more abundant (8-10%) biotite. Layering is typically strongly deformed. Libby (1984) described rocks from Quairnie Rock as metamorphosed gneiss that may have been tonalitic in composition (GSWA 63533).   Several phases of pegmatite, some aplitic, postdate the deformation that produced the banded gneiss. Metamorphic recrystallization and alteration (e.g. albitization) of components of the gneiss are consistent with a complex history of intrusion and deformation as suggested by the range of geochronological data obtained from this unit (see Geochronology). Good exposures of the gneiss with its various textures and crosscutting veins can be seen at Durgulyie Rock (Zone 51, MGA 322830E 6534525N).  Based on analyses of five samples, Cassidy et al. (2002) assigned the Connolly Gneiss to the high-Ca group of Yilgarn Craton granites. However, the range of age data from this formation and evidence of multiple intrusions indicates a complex intrusive history. ",,,,,"Unequivocal contacts between the Connolly Gneiss and adjacent greenstones of the Kalgoorlie Group (A-KG-xbb-u) have not been observed (Hunter, 1991).

It is also recorded from small outcrops close to the Mount Vernon Fault on MOUNT VERNON and TANGADEE. The formation has a conformable, gradational contact with the underlying Ullawarra Formation and an unconformable contact with the overlying Collier Group. The Coodardoo Formation is composed of thinly to very thickly bedded, lithic quartz sandstone and pebbly sandstone, interbedded with siltstone. A thin siltstone and sandstone member (P_-MEc-sf) has been mapped in the middle of the formation on ELLIOTT CREEK, ULLAWARRA, and EDMUND. The formation was sourced from areas to the southeast and northwest of the present outcrop area and deposited as submarine fans in a deep-marine shelf environment at c. 1455 Ma. ","The Coodardoo Formation, the uppermost unit of the Edmund Group, is exposed around the core of the Wanna Syncline on ELLIOTT CREEK, ULLAWARRA, EDMUND, MOUNT AUGUSTUS, PEEDAWARRA and western KENNETH RANGE. Farther east, most of the formation has been removed by pre-Collier Group erosion, apart from isolated occurrences in the Bronco Syncline on TANGADEE and MOUNT VERNON, and in a fault-bounded sliver associated with the Lofty Range Fault on TANGADEE. The maximum thickness of the Coodardoo Formation ranges from 150 to 370 m (Daniels, 1975).","The Coodardoo Sandstone was established by Daniels (1966) as a result of his revision of the Top Camp Dolomite (Halligan and Daniels, 1964). The name was given to the thick sandstone succession that occurred between the Curran Formation (now a member of the Ullawarra Formation) and the overlying Fords Creek Shale (Backdoor Formation, Collier Group). The Coodardoo Sandstone was later renamed the Coodardoo Formation by Daniels (1968) and a full definition was provided by Muhling and Brakel (1985).  The former name, Coodardoo Sandstone, appears to have originated through a misspelling of Coodardo Gap, on the southern limb of the Wanna Syncline, 1.5 km northeast of Coodardo Well (Zone 50, MGA 462180E 7366100N) on ELLIOTT CREEK. The type section for the formation is in Coodardo Gap (Muhling and Brakel, 1985) and has a measured thickness of 238 m (Martin and Thorne, 2002).",,"The Coodardoo Formation (P_-MEc-st) is composed of thinly to very thickly bedded, fine- to very coarse-grained lithic quartz sandstone and pebbly sandstone, interbedded with siltstone. A thin siltstone and sandstone member (P_-MEc-sf) has been mapped in the middle of the formation on ELLIOTT CREEK, ULLAWARRA, and EDMUND. The transition from the top of the Ullawarra Formation to the Coodardoo Formation is marked by an increase in both the thickness and number of sandstone beds, and takes place over an interval of approximately 15 m. The Coodardoo Formation sandstones are resistant to weathering and erosion, and outcrop as prominent ridges and low hills separated by units of poorly exposed siltstone and sandstone.  Early descriptions of the Coodardoo Formation are given by Daniels (1966), Chuck (1984), and Muhling and Brakel (1985), whereas the following summary is taken from the more recent accounts by Martin and Thorne (2002) and Martin et al. (2005).   Sandstone beds are generally tabular, massive to normally graded, and either amalgamated or capped by very thin, parallel-planar laminated mudstone (Martin et al., 2005). Amalgamated beds are commonly massive and 0.3 - 2 m thick, with gently undulating contacts and localized scour-and-fill structures. Graded beds locally contain very coarse-grained sandstone to either granulestone or pebble conglomerate at the base, and diffuse horizontal lamination is highlighted by selective silicification. The parallel-planar laminated mudstone that caps graded sandstone beds comprises less than 40% of sandstone-dominated units.  Well-preserved dewatering structures are a characteristic feature of the Coodardoo Formation, and include streaks, dishes, dykes, and disrupted lamination. Load casts are locally well preserved where sandstone beds overlie mudstone. Hummocky stratification and low-angle cross-stratification are locally preserved in coarse to very-coarse sandstone. Some sandstone beds contain disseminated goethite cubes and moulds after pyrite, which are up to a maximum of one centimetre across. Bed thickness displays both upward thickening and thinning trends, although the latter is more typical of the upper Coodardoo Formation. Sole markings are abundant, but are mostly lineation-tool marks with no polarity. In cases where polarity can be determined, such as with prod marks and flute casts, paleocurrent directions are towards the southeast and northwest. However, it is not possible to determine which of these transport directions predominates, or whether they are axial or transverse to the basin margins. Ripple lamination is rare at the tops of graded sandstone beds, but gives paleocurrent directions towards the southeast.  Sandstones in the Coodardoo Formation are mainly poorly sorted lithic quartz arenites and quartz arenites (Martin et al., 2005). They consist of 60-80% monocrystalline and polycrystalline angular to rounded quartz, 20-30% lithic fragments (mainly chert or silicified siltstone, siltstone, and possible felsic volcanic rock), and less than 5% feldspar (mostly fresh K-feldspar and plagioclase). Accessory minerals include tourmaline, zircon, detrital muscovite, apatite, sphene, iron oxides, and opaque minerals. The matrix is largely indeterminate due to compaction; however, the presence of syntaxial quartz overgrowths suggests it was originally quartz cement. Compaction has also resulted in the formation of sutured grain contacts. Minor anhedral opaque minerals (possibly iron oxides) occur as diagenetic aggregates. Minor lithic quartz wackes in the Coodardoo Formation have a similar grain composition to the lithic quartz arenites, with a matrix of microcrystalline quartz-silt rich in chlorite and sericite. Minor anhedral carbonate is present locally as a diagenetic replacement.  Siltstone layers generally have gradational lower contacts with underlying sandstone beds while their upper contacts with the sandstone are generally sharp and erosional. The internal structure of the siltstone is either massive, parallel-planar laminated or ripple cross-laminated.","Martin and Thorne (2004) and Martin et al. (2005) interpret the Coodardoo Formation as a deep-marine shelf submarine-fan deposit. Sandstones were probably deposited from both highly concentrated and relatively dilute turbidtiy currents, whereas siltstones were laid down during the final stages of turbidity current deposition and also from suspension settling in the intervening quiet-water periods. The ambiguity surrounding the paleocurrent data makes it difficult to interpret the significance of these turbidites to basin evolution. Daniels (1966) had earlier suggested that during deposition of the Coodardoo Formation, uplift to the north had changed paleocurrent directions from easterly to southerly. The limited paleocurrent data available show that some sediment for the Coodardoo Formation was still being supplied from a southeastern source, although there was also an increasing contribution from an upland area to the northwest of the present-day outcrop area.",,370,,"The Coodardoo Formation is the youngest stratigraphic unit of the Edmund Group. It gradationally overlies either the Curran Member (P_-MElc-sf) of the Ullawarra Formation, or the Ullawarra Formation parent (P_-MEl-sl). In either situation, the lower contact is placed at the base of the first thick-bedded sandstone, which usually forms a readily identifiable break in slope. The Coodardoo Formation is unconformably overlain by the Backdoor Formation, the basal unit of the Collier Group.",,17,,,,4,,,,1455,,1455,,"The Coodardoo Formation has not been dated directly; however, its maximum age is thought to be close to the c. 1455 Ma age for the youngest felsic volcaniclastic rocks in the underlying Ullawarra Formation (GSWA 143440, Wingate et al., 2012). This interpretation is based on the gradational contact between the two formations and the likely rapid deposition of the Coodardoo Formation. A c. 1070 Ma sill belonging to the Kulkatharra Dolerite (P_-WKk-od) has been intruded along the contact between the Coodardoo Formation and the overlying Backdoor Formation on ELLIOTT CREEK (Wingate, 2002) and provides a more conservative constraint on the minimum age.  Minimum ages of detrital zircons collected from the Coodardoo Formation generally reflect the ages of the Capricorn Orogen basement. The youngest component of detrital zircons in a sample collected from a sandstone outcropping on the northern limb of the Wanna Syncline about 3.7 km south-southeast of Strama Bore on ELLIOTT CREEK (Zone 50, MGA  58478E 7393233N) has been dated at 1674 Â± 24 Ma (GSWA 148975, Wingate et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2008) and the youngest zircon is 1653 Â± 23 Ma (1&sigma;). Martin et al. (2008) also obtained an age of 1692 Â± 15 Ma from the youngest population of detrital zircons in a sample (GSWA 152962) collected from the type section at Coordadoo Gap (Zone 50, MGA 463182E 7367237N). The youngest zircon in this samples is 1602 Â± 94 Ma (1&sigma;). Both samples have discrete modes in the 1800-1600 Ma age ranges that are uncommon in Depositional packages 1 to 3 of the Edmund Group (Martin et al., 2008). There is also an abundance of zircons with modes in the 2800-2400 Ma age range, consistent with derivation from erosion of the Hamersley and Fortescue Groups in the Pilbara region. Suppression of the younger Paleoproterozoic modes suggests that erosion of source areas containing zircons of this age was reduced, perhaps due to the significant deepening and expansion of the Edmund Basin at the base of Depositional package 4 (Martin and Thorne, 2004).",No,,,1,,No,Published,No,No,P_,MEc,,,,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,No,No

The Cummins Range carbonatite is a 1.8 by 1.7 km intrusion composed of an outer layer of pyroxenite, an inner layer of metasomatised pyroxenite which was intruded by calcite carbonatite (sovite) and dolomite carbonatite (beforsite) dykes and veins. The veins and dykes contain variable proportions of apatite, phlogopite, magnetite that have been weathered to silicified ironstone breccia at the surface. The unit was intruded at 1009 Â± 16 Ma (Downes et al., 2016) into the Paleoproterozoic San Sou Monzogranite within the Eastern Zone of the Lamboo Province, possibly during the Yampi Orogeny.","The Cummins Range carbonatite is located 130 km southwest of the town of Halls Creek and 67 km west of Wolfe Creek Crater on the MOUNT BANNERMAN 1:250 000 map sheet. The unit extent and characteristics are inferred from a combination of drilling and magnetic image interpretation and is a composite of subvertical intrusions measuring 1.8 by 1.7 km in plan. It comprises three broadly concentric zones, with the concentric pattern broken by a plug of carbonated phlogopite-pyroxenite intruding the eastern edge of the intrusion (Andrew 1990). The carbonatite has a central zone of calcite carbonatite (sovite) and dolomite carbonatite (beforsite) dykes surrounded by variably carbonated and metasomatically altered clinopyroxenite (Andrew, 1990; Downes et al., 2014). Adjacent to the central carbonatite zone, the clinopyroxenite intruded by numerous steeply dipping carbonatite dykes up to 60 m thick (Andrew 1990). The outer envelope comprises less altered clinopyroxenite (Downes et al. 2014). The carbonatite has little surface expression, being concealed by an eolian sand sheet. Exposure is limited to patchy outcrops of jasperoidal, matrix-supported ironstone breccia forming low mounds 8 km south of the Cummins Range (Zone 52, MGA 308323E 7874763N) (Andrew, 1990).","The Cummins Range carbonatite name is derived from the proximity of the intrusion to the Cummins range (Zone 52K, MGA 308323N 7874763N) and because its central lithology is dominated by carbonatite. Cummins Range Carbonatite, Cummins Range carbonatite complex and Cummins Range complex are three alternative informal names commonly found in the literature. However, the unit should be solely referred to as the Cummins Range carbonatite.",,"The Cummins Range carbonatite intruded the Paleoproterozoic San Sou Monzogranite and forms three broadly concentric zones composed of pyroxenite and carbonatite rocks. The outer envelope has variable mineralogy and texture, ranging from clinopyroxenite to micaceous clinopyroxenite with a mineral assemblage that includes phlogopite, diopside, apatite, magnetite, calcite, ilmenite, metasomatic Na - Ca amphiboles and accessory zirconolite (Andrew, 1990; Downes et al., 2014). The inner envelope is a metasomatized clinopyroxenite showing wide variation in its texture and mineralogy, comprising granular diopside and cores of biotite enclosed by phlogopite (Andrew, 1990). This inner zone contains accessory minerals including zircon, sphene, baddeleyite, monazite, aeschynite, pyrochlore, columbite and allanite (Downes et al., 2014). The central zone is dominated by calcite carbonatite (sovite) and dolomite carbonatite (beforsite) dykes surrounded by variably carbonated and metasomatized clinopyroxenite (Andrew, 1990; Downes et al., 2014). The central zone also contains abundant apatite and variable amounts of phlogopite, magnetite and amphibole (Andrew 1990; Downes et al. 2014). In addition, veins and vugs up to several centimetres wide contain pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite, with occasional barite and fluorite (Downes et al. 2014).  The concentric pattern of the Cummins Range carbonatite is interrupted by a plug of carbonated phlogopite - clinopyroxenite intruding the eastern edge of the intrusion (Andrew 1990). In addition, both the carbonatite and clinopyroxenite are cut by vertical to sub-vertical shear zones, trending between 315&deg; and 330&deg;, that include weakly to strongly foliated dolomite carbonatite, zones of phlogopite and zones of high-REE apatite - monazite rock (Downes et al. 2016). Sulphide assemblages composed of pyrrhotite, pyrite and chalcopyrite Â± sphalerite Â± galena Â± magnetite are common to both the clinopyroxenite and various phases of the carbonatite, where they may form sulphide-rich bands and lenses (Downes et al., 2014). With increasing alteration towards the core of the intrusion, pyroxene is progressively veined and replaced by amphibole + chlorite, whereas micro-veins of carbonate become denser and interstitial carbonate becomes the dominant mineral (Downes et al. 2014). Ultimately, only relict fibres of amphibole persist in a carbonate matrix (Andrew 1990).  The intrusion is concealed by an eolian sand sheet of varying thickness and exposure is limited to patchy outcrop of jasperoidal matrix-supported ironstone breccia (Andrew 1990). The in situ regolith units are enriched in resistate minerals including zircon, pyrochlore and REE-rich monazite (Andrew, 1990).

The member has conformable, gradational contacts with the underlying Ullawarra Formation parent and the overlying Coodardoo Formation. The succession is dominated by interbedded siltstone and thin- to medium-bedded turbidite sandstone, with the proportion of the latter becoming greater towards the top of the member. These rocks were deposited in a deep-marine shelf environment, during a period of increasing siliciclastic sediment input. The Curran Member was probably deposited around 1590-1455 Ma. "," The Curran Member has only been mapped around the margins of the Wanna Syncline on ULLAWARRA, ELLIOTT CREEK, KENNETH RANGE, EDMUND, MOUNT AUGUSTUS, and PEEDAWARRA. In most areas the member forms a break in slope between the low hills and flats of the Ullawarra Formation and the steep cliffs of the Coodardoo Formation. The thickness is estimated to be about 100 m in the type section in Wannery Creek on ULLAWARRA, increasing to 250 m on southern ELLIOTT CREEK (Daniels, 1966; Muhling and Brakel, 1985). Further to the southeast, on southern limb of the Wanna Syncline on PEEDAWARRA, the member has a maximum thickness of about 80 m. "," Daniels (1966) established the Curran Formation as a result of his revision of the former Top Camp Dolomite (Halligan and Daniels, 1964). This nomenclature was subsequently utilised by later workers, including Brakel and Muhling (1976), Chuck (1984), and Muhling and Brakel (1985).   Although Daniels (1966) considered the Curran Formation to be a distinctive unit between the fine-grained Ullawarra Formation below and the sandstone-dominated Coodardoo Formation above, Martin et al. (1999) noted that this unit is not easily recognized because of its overall lithological similarity to the Ullawarra Formation. As a consequence, the Curran Formation was lowered to member status within the Ullawarra Formation and re-defined to include the siltstone and sandstone beds that outcrop immediately below the Coodardoo Formation (Martin et al., 1999; Martin and Thorne, 2002).  The former Curran Formation was named after Curran Well (Zone 50, MGA 416400E 7411900N) on ULLAWARRA and the type section is along the eastern fork of Wannery Creek at Curran Well (Muhling and Brakel, 1985). A 150 m-thick reference section has been measured below the Coodardoo Formation type section, 1.5 km northeast of Coodardo Well (Zone 50, MGA 462200E 7366100N) on ELLIOTT CREEK (Martin and Thorne, 2002). ",," The Curran Member (P_-MElc-sf) is lithologically similar to the Ullawarra Formation parent (P_-MEl-sl), consisting of parallel-planar laminated siltstone interbedded with thinly to medium-bedded, fine- to coarse-grained sandstone. The principal difference between the two units is the greater proportion of sandstone in the Curran Member. In areas where the proportion of sandstone is low, the Curran Member is often lithologically indistinguishable from the Ullawarra Formation.   Siltstones are massive to parallel-planar laminated or ripple cross-laminated. Sandstone beds commonly show normal grading and both bed thickness and maximum grain-size increase towards the top of the member. Sandstone beds may have a massive basal division, overlain by parallel-planar lamination or ripple cross-lamination. Flute casts, groove marks, load structures, and rare dish structures have also been recorded (Chuck, 1984) and paleocurrent indicators generally record a flow to the northwest (Daniels, 1966; Martin and Thorne, 2004).     "," The predominantly fine-grained nature of the Curran Member, together with the range of sedimentary structures preserved, indicates it was deposited in a deep-marine shelf environment. The higher proportion of sandstone turbidites, particularly within upper parts of the member suggests deposition took place during a period of significantly increased siliciclastic-sediment supply. Paleocurrent indicators in the turbidite facies show a southeasterly derivation and may reflect axial flow within the basin.   ",,250,," The Curran Member has conformable gradational contacts with the the Ullawarra Formation parent below and the Coodardoo Formation above.

Based on the age of its Ullawarra Formation parent (P_-MEl-sl) these rocks were probably deposited between c. 1590 and 1455 Ma, and most likely close to the younger age constraint  The youngest group of detrital zircons in a sample collected from sandstone outcropping 1.2 km northeast of Coodardo Well on ELLIOTT CREEK (Zone 50, MGA 458182E 7394718N) has been dated at 1680 Â± 10 Ma (GSWA 148974, Wingate et al., 2007).

4121,5139,P_-HAbd-cib,4113,Dales Gorge Member,1,"Banded iron-formation, chert, mudstone, and siltstone","The Dales Gorge Member is the most economically important unit within the Brockman Iron Formation because it hosts large high-grade iron ore deposits at Mount Tom Price, Mount Whaleback, and Brockman. It has also been the subject of intensive study regarding its significance to understanding the chemical composition of the Paleoproterozoic atmosphere and ocean. The Dales Gorge Member is about 120-180 m thick and consists of 17 banded iron-formation (BIF) macrobands and 16 shale macrobands that can be correlated with remarkable consistency throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region. The BIF macrobands of the Dales Gorge Member are well bedded, with well-developed layering at all scales, and referred to as either mesobanding or microbanding. The shales consist of various proportions of terrigenous mudstone and siltstone, mafic and felsic volcaniclastic ashfall tuff, chert, and carbonate, but have iron contents compatible with their classification as iron formation sensu stricto. The Dales Gorge Member conformably overlies the Mount McRae Shale and, in turn, is conformably overlain by the Whaleback Shale Member. The depositional environment of the Dales Gorge Member was exclusively pelagic and hemipelagic and was located basinward of a carbonate platform. The abundance of volcaniclastic ashfall detritus mixed with terrigenous detritus is suggestive of a volcanically active basin, probably located in a back-arc setting. The age of the Dales Gorge Member is well constrained between c. 2494 and 2464 Ma.","The Dales Gorge Member is about 120-180 m thick (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). It is exposed throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region on the 1:250 000 map sheets DAMPIER, YARRALOOLA, PYRAMID, WYLOO, MOUNT BRUCE, ROY HILL, TUREE CREEK, NEWMAN, and ROBERTSON where it forms spectacular cliffs and large hills that constitute the Hamersley and Ophthalmia Ranges. It is exceptionally well exposed in the Karijini National Park in deep gorges incised into these ranges during post-Miocene uplift of the province (Powell and Horwitz, 1994).","The Dales Gorge Member was formally defined by Trendall and Blockley (1968), who specified the type locality as Dales Gorge (Zone 50, MGA 660106E 7513484N) in the Karijini National Park, and a composite type section from three diamond drillholes from the Wittenoom Gorge area about 28 km to the northwest. The three drillholes, drilled by Australian Blue Asbestos Pty Ltd in the 1960s are W47A, Y1, and EC10. Two of these holes (W47A and Y1) are stored in the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) Core Library at Carlisle. A well exposed and accessible reference section is present in Cathedral Gorge (Zone 50, MGA 768555E 7423647N) on the Great Northern Highway 15 km northwest of Newman.  Trendall and Blockley (1968) subdivided the member into 17 BIF macrobands (numbered BIF0 to BIF16) and 16 shale macrobands (numbered S1 to S16) that can be further grouped into three larger divisions based on the relative abundance of shale and BIF macrobands (Taylor et al., 2001; Kepert, 2018). These larger subdivisions are designated DG1 (BIF0 to BIF5), DG2 (S6 to S11) and DG3 (BIF11 to BIF16). Because macroband terminology is also used in other stratigraphic units, the Dales Gorge BIF macrobands are usually abbreviated as DB0 to DB16 and the shale macrobands as DS1 to DS16. The Colonial Chert Member of the underlying Mount McRae Shale is included in the Dales Gorge Member by some mining companies and designated DG1 in a fourfold subdivision (Harmsworth et al., 1990; Kepert, 2018). This practice is primarily for practical mining and ore definition purposes because iron enrichment at the base of the Dales Gorge Member locally extends down into the Colonial Chert Member (Harmsworth et al., 1990; Taylor et al., 2001).",,"Perhaps the most striking feature of the Dales Gorge Member is the regularity of its layering on all scales, which led Trendall (1965) to define three scales of layering, which he termed macrobanding, mesobanding, and microbanding. Macrobanding is the interlayering of different lithologies, primarily BIF and shale, which characterizes outcrops at the metre scale. Mesobanding refers to alternating layers or chert and iron formation that are of the order of centimetres to decimetres thick and give the BIF macrobands their characteristic banded appearance. Microbands are the finely alternating iron-rich and chert-rich layers that are manifested at the millimetre- to submillimeter-scale within mesobands. Trendall and Blockley (1970) provide a detailed description of the banding and lithological variation within the Dales Gorge Member.  The BIF macrobands of the Dales Gorge Member are well bedded, with well-developed mesobanding and microbanding. The DG1 and DG3 macroband groups have a blocky weathering pattern that forms distinct cliffs, whereas DG2 is more cherty in outcrop and has a more rounded weathering pattern. Mesobanding and microbanding are characterized by alternating layers with varying proportions of iron-bearing minerals and chert. The most important iron minerals are magnetite, hematite, stilpnomelane, and riebeckite. Stilpnomelane-rich beds are particularly distinctive, being black or greenish in fresh core, but weathering to yellow clay in outcrop. However, yellow weathering is also indicative of the presence of trace carbonates (especially siderite), as are two marker beds near the upper and lower contact which are the weathering product of small carbonate nodules.   The shales of the Dales Gorge Member consist of various proportions of terrigenous mudstone and siltstone, mafic and felsic volcaniclastic ashfall tuff, chert, and carbonate (Alibert and McCullouch, 1993; Pickard et al., 2004). However, they are characteristically stilpnomelane-rich with iron contents compatible with their classification as iron formation sensu stricto. The term  shale  is widely used to distinguish them from the lithologically different BIF macrobands. Weathered shales consist mainly of kaolinitc clays with varying amounts of secondary iron staining. Carbonate intraclast conglomerates are present in DS2 and at the base of DS1 and DS4. There is also a 0.5 - 5 m-thick crystalline dolomite in DS15 along the front of the Hamersley Range that is also present at Coondewanna Ridge (Kepert, 2018). The DS4 macroband locally contains breccia (Trendall and Blockley, 1970) with abundant impact spherules in the matrix (Simonson, 1992; Simonson et al., 2009). It has an erosional base indicative of unusually high-energy deposition compared to the enclosing strata.","The lithological composition of the Dales Gorge Member and the absence of sedimentary structures formed above storm wave base implies that deposition was exclusively pelagic and hemipelagic, and took place in front of a carbonate platform. Early interpretations suggested that deposition happened in a barred basin (Trendall, 1975) or a submerged volcanogenic platform or bank and precluded deposition in a deep ocean basin (Morris and Horwitz, 1983). More recent studies interpret deposition to have taken place on basin floor fans in an ocean basin that deepened to the southwest (Simonson et al., 1993; KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003; Pickard et al., 2004). The presence of carbonate turbidites and debris flows in the shale macrobands confirms a depositional setting that was basinward of rather than on a platform (Morris and Horwitz, 1983). The mixing of volcaniclastic ashfall detritus with terrigenous detritus (Alibert and McCulloch, 1993) is suggestive of a volcanically active basin, probably located in a back-arc setting (Blake and Barley, 1992). The DS4 macroband is interpreted as the distal product of a marine bolide impact onto predominantly oceanic crust (Simonson, 1992; Sweeney and Simonson, 2008; Simonson et al., 2009).  Microband pairs within chert and chert matrix of the Hamersley Group have been interpreted by Trendall (1972) as varves, with each microband representing one year of deposition of colloidal chemical precipitates (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). However, the origin of microbanding within Hamersley Group BIF remains contentious. Recent studies suggest that the primary sediments were not solely the product of pelagic settling of colloidal chemical precipitates (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003; Pickard et al., 2004) and that much of the present-day mineralogical composition is the product of post-depositional processes. It is therefore not a proxy for oceanic or atmospheric chemistry (Bekker et al., 2014; Rasmussen et al., 2016).",,180,,"The Dales Gorge Member conformably overlies the Mount McRae Shale and, in turn, is conformably overlain by the Whaleback Shale Member. The basal contact between the BIF0 macroband and underlying shale is about 70 cm above a distinctive marker horizon known as  Trendall s bed of holes  at the top of the Colonial Chert Member in the underlying Mount McRae Shale. The upper contact between BIF16 and shale of the overlying Whaleback Shale Member is similarly marked by a characteristic horizon of small weathered carbonate nodules known as  Huleatt s bed of holes  that is about 20 cm below the contact.",,17,,,,5,,,,2494,,2464,,"The Dales Gorge Member is younger than a 2504 Â± 5 Ma ashfall tuff bed in the underlying Mount McRae Shale (Rasmussen et al., 2005) and older than a 2463 Â± 5 Ma tuff bed in the overlying Whaleback Shale Member (Trendall et al., 2004). Three depositional ages have been obtained from tuffaceous shale mesobands within the Dales Gorge Member by Trendall et al., (2004), viz. 2495 Â± 16 Ma (DS2), 2481 Â± 4 Ma (DS9), and 2461 Â± 6 Ma (DS13).

7,33444,P_-DA-mg,1,Dalgaringa Supersuite,1,Metagranite and granitic gneiss,"The Dalgaringa Supersuite consists of massive, foliated, and gneissic granites dated at 2005-1970 Ma (Sheppard et al., 1999). On GLENBURGH the supersuite comprises two episodes of magmatism, separated by a deformation and high-grade regional metamorphic event. The two magmatic episodes are represented by 2005-1985 Ma foliated to gneissic, metamorphosed quartz diorite, as well as metatonalite, metagranodiorite, and metamonzogranite, and c. 1975 Ma metatonalite and metagranodiorite of the Nardoo Granite. Between these two magmatic episodes, and after the deformation and regional metamorphism, sheets of foliated leucocratic metamonzogranite intruded the early foliated to gneissic granites. Foliated and gneissic granites range from strongly deformed and completely recrystallized foliated and gneissic granite in zones of high strain, to statically recrystallized granite with preserved intrusive relationships in areas of low strain. All the rocks have been metamorphosed at medium to high grade, even where evidence of substantial strain is lacking.   In zones of moderate to high strain, the rocks are pegmatite banded and strongly resemble Archean mesocratic granitic gneiss in the Narryer Terrane (Occhipinti et al., 1998; Sheppard and Swager, 1999). Williams et al. (1983) and Williams (1986) interpreted the foliated and gneissic granites as a migmatite produced during Proterozoic high-grade metamorphism and anatexis of Archean granites. However, SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dating of numerous samples from the Dalgaringa Supersuite indicates that all the rocks are Paleoproterozoic in age. The geochronology, geochemistry, and Nd isotopic compositions of the supersuite were discussed by Sheppard et al. (2004).","Metagranites of the Dalgaringa Supersuite are an integral component of the Glenburgh Terrane, which is exposed in the Mooloo and Paradise Zones at the southern end of the Gascoyne Province. Metagranites of the supersuite outcrop mainly in the Paradise Zone along the southern edge of the province and its continuation to the west, the Carrandibby Inlier. The Dalgaringa Supersuite outcrops over much of the southern part of GLENBURGH, and to the east, in the southwestern corner of LANDOR. The supersuite may also underlie Cenozoic units of the Macadam Plains in the eastern half of LANDOR. Geochronological studies indicate that rocks of the supersuite are a component of the Halfway Gneiss in the Mooloo Zone on northern GLENBURGH.","The granitic supersuite was named after Dalgaringa Bore on LANDOR, and the name Dalgaringa Supersuite was first used in Sheppard et al. (1999).",,"The Dalgaringa Supersuite comprises 2005-1985 Ma foliated to gneissic granites, and c. 1975 Ma metatonalite and metagranodiorite of the Nardoo Granite. The foliated to gneissic granites are divided into a number of units that are composites of different rock types. In outcrop, the individual rock types comprise sheets, dykes, and veins, and cannot themselves be represented as separate units on maps. The boundaries between the mapped units are typically gradational, and mark changes in the abundance of one or more main rock types. The boundaries are commonly parallel to the regional tectonic fabric. The foliated to gneissic granites comprise five main rock types:  &bull; fine- to medium-grained, mesocratic, metamorphosed quartz diorite, metatonalite, and metadiorite (collectively referred to as  tonalite ) &bull; fine- to medium-grained, pale-grey biotite metamonzogranite and leucocratic metatonalite ( fine-grained granite ) &bull; medium-grained, variably porphyritic metatonalite and metagranodiorite ( mafic granodiorite ) &bull; medium-grained, leucocratic biotite metamonzogranite and metagranodiorite ( felsic granodiorite ) &bull; coarse-grained, leucocratic biotite metagranite and metapegmatite (P_-DA-mgp;  pegmatite ).  Veins and sheets of coarse-grained, leucocratic biotite metagranite and metapegmatite (P_-DA-mgp) consistently intrude the other four rock types. All these rock types, including the metapegmatite, are extensively intruded by medium-grained, leucocratic metamonzogranite (P_-DA-mgml). All rock types in the Dalgaringa Supersuite, including the c. 1975 Ma Nardoo Granite, commonly have a blotchy appearance due to the presence of clots (0.5 - 2 cm in diameter) of fine-grained biotite after garnet.",,,,,"The Dalgaringa Supersuite forms the bulk of the Glenburgh Terrane in the Paradise Zone, and is probably also widespread in the Mooloo Zone to the north, where it is tectonically interleaved with Archean to Paleoproterozoic granitic rocks as part of the Halfway Gneiss. The Dalgaringa Supersuite presumably intruded the protoliths to the Halfway Gneiss, but there is little evidence preserved of an intrusive relationship. In the Paradise Well area, strips and lenses of metasedimentary rock outcrop within the Dalgaringa Supersuite (P_-mli-GAG). The Dalgaringa Supersuite is younger than the Moogie Metamorphics, and probably intruded the metamorphic rocks. The Dalgaringa Supersuite is intruded by various granites of the Moorarie Supersuite, as well as dykes of the Bertibubba Supersuite in the Paradise Zone.",,17,,,,8,,,,2002,5,1974,4,"About 14 granitic rocks from the Dalgaringa Supersuite sampled for SHRIMP U-Pb zircon geochronology yielded crystallization ages ranging between 2002 Â± 3 Ma and 1974 Â± 4 Ma.

The Nardoo Granite contains inclusions of folded, foliated, and gneissic granites, indicating an episode of tectonism between the two pulses of granitic magmatism. Most granitic rocks from the Dalgaringa Supersuite contain very few xenocrystic zircons, most of which are Paleoproterozoic in age, and similar to the crystallization ages obtained from the Halfway Gneiss protoliths (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011).",No,,,13,d,No,Published,Yes,Yes,P_,DA,,13,23,a,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,No,No

It outcrops over at least 5000 km 2  in the centre of the province, where it forms the Davey Well batholith and associated intrusions. The batholith has been imaged in the Capricorn Orogen seismic reflection survey (Johnson et al., 2011) where it is shown to form a tabular intrusion about 11 km thick. The total volume of granite within the batholith is estimated at approximately 55 000 km 3 . Outside of the Davey Well batholith, smaller stocks and intrusions occur in the northern part of the Gascoyne Province, on the central part of LYNDON and northern part of TOWERA.  Despite the large volume of granite within the batholith, the Davey Well Granite is relatively homogenous, comprising schistose, coarse-grained, strongly porphyritic biotite metamonzogranite. The granite contains oval to round K-feldspar phenocrysts (mostly 1-4 cm in diameter), which locally form megacrysts (>5 cm in diameter). The Davey Well Granite commonly contains lenses and thin layers of metamorphosed quartz diorite and tonalite (P_-DUtl-mgt) of the Telow Granite, which may once have formed a significant layer or intrusion within the batholith. Five SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dates from the Davey Well Granite yielded igneous crystallization ages between c. 1670 and c. 1648 Ma, indicating that granite intrusion and construction of the Davey Well batholith took place over a period of 20 m.y.","The Davey Well Granite forms two very large intrusions, one on EUDAMULLAH and the other on YINNETHARRA. Smaller plutons are present on LYONS RIVER, MOUNT SANDIMAN, TOWERA, LYNDON and within the Chalba Shear Zone on the southern part of YINNETHARRA and LOCKIER. The Davey Well Granite outcrops over much of southeastern EUDAMULLAH, and probably underlies more than 500 km 2  of the southern part of the sheet, extending onto MOUNT SANDIMAN to the west. On aeromagnetic images, this intrusion resembles a sigma porphyroclast with  tails , suggesting sinistral shear. The Davey Well Granite also outcrops over about 950 km 2  on YINNETHARRA to the southeast. This intrusion was previously referred to as the  Yinnetharra Gneiss Dome  by Williams (1986). This pluton extends under the Southern Carnarvon Basin and outcrops in the Weedarra Inlier on LYONS RIVER. Together these two large intrusions (including P_-DUda-mgmw) form the Davey Well batholith, and outcrop over nearly 5000 km 2 . The batholith was imaged in the Capricorn Orogen deep crustal seismic reflection survey (Johnson et al., 2011) where it is shown to form an about 11 km thick tabular intrusion. Based on the thickness and aerial distribution, the batholith contains approximately 55 000 km 3  of coarse-grained granitic material &mdash; a volume that is comparable to that of the Minnie Creek batholith. An isolated intrusion of porphyritic biotite metamonzogranite 9 km long and 6 km wide lies within the northern part of the Minnie Creek batholith on LYNDON. Another isolated, elliptical pluton 6 km long and 2 km wide, occurrs between the Johnson Creek and Mountain Creek Faults on the northern part of TOWERA.  The Davey Well Granite outcrops as boulders, tors, and pavements, and typically forms low, undulating country with very coarse to coarse-grained sandy aprons of colluvium.  ","The Davey Well Granite was named after the abandoned Davey Well (Zone 50, MGA 390726E 7303784N) on EUDAMULLAH.",,"The Davey Well Granite is a reasonably homogeneous unit comprising schistose, coarse-grained, strongly porphyritic biotite metamonzogranite, although there is some variation in the abundance and size of K-feldspar phenocrysts. Oval to round K-feldspar phenocrysts are mostly 1-4 cm in diameter, but locally form megacrysts (>5 cm in diameter). The K-feldspar phenocrysts typically constitute around 30% of the rock, but in places they make up only 10-15%. The phenocrysts have inclusions of fine-grained biotite, quartz, and ?plagioclase, which commonly define growth zones.  Most of the rocks are moderately to strongly foliated, particularly adjacent to the southern margin of the Minnie Creek batholith, where the rocks are locally gneissic. On EUDAMULLAH and MOUNT SANDIMAN, the foliation in the Davey Well Granite typically dips steeply to the south. On YINNETHARRA, the foliation dips steeply to the south along the northern edge of the intrusion, but also defines a very broad arc that is convex to the southeast. The dip on the foliation is commonly moderate or even shallow. In parts of the Davey Well Granite, for example south of Yinnetharra Homestead, the foliation is an L-tectonite fabric. Zones of massive or weakly foliated metamonzogranite are not common, probably being best developed west and southwest of Davey Well. Weakly deformed rocks consist of massive, coarse-grained, strongly porphyritic biotite monzogranite with euhedral crystals (1-2 mm long) of titanite. In places these are intergrown with iron oxide minerals, suggesting that the titanite is magmatic. The monzogranite also contains crystals of allanite (~0.2 mm long) and accessory zircon and apatite. Microperthite phenocrysts contain abundant blebby to stringer-like inclusions of microperthite, microcline, quartz, biotite, and plagioclase. Quartz is recrystallized in part to subgrain mosaics and plagioclase is weakly sericitized; biotite is dark brown.  Isolated intrusions outside of the Davey Well batholith, i.e. those on LYNDON and TOWERA, have similar textures and compositions to those within the batholith, but are generally massive and undeformed.  The Davey Well Granite commonly contains small scattered inclusions of grey biotite microgranite, and larger blocks (up to a few metres long) of foliated leucocratic biotite metamonzogranite. Inclusions of biotite-rich pelitic schist are also present, particularly near the margins of the intrusions. ",,,,,"Schistose, coarse-grained, strongly porphyritic biotite metamonzogranite is in contact with several other units of the Durlacher Supersuite, and metasedimentary and meta-igneous rocks of the Leake Spring and Pooranoo Metamorphics. Many of the contacts are faulted, but inclusions of several units are widespread. Inclusions in the Davey Well Granite comprise calc-silicate gneiss (P_-PO-mkq) and cobble and boulder metaconglomerate (P_-POb-mxq) of the Pooranoo Metamorphics, and amphibolite (P_-LS-mwa) of the Leake Spring Metamorphics. Much of the Davey Well Granite also contains scattered lenticular inclusions of fine-grained biotite-quartz-muscovite schist and quartz-muscovite-biotite schist (P_-POb-mlsm). In places, medium-grained sparsely porphyritic biotite monzogranite inclusions are present. These may represent earlier crystallized parts of the intrusion, as they contain scattered K-feldspar phenocrysts similar to those in the host granite. In the area between Tommie Well and Granite Well on EUDAMULLAH, the Davey Well Granite contains inclusions and rafts of garnet- or staurolite-bearing pelitic schist (P_-LS-mlsg), and mesocratic, equigranular to sparsely porphyritic biotite metatonalite and metamorphosed quartz diorite (P_-MO-mgts).   To the west on MOUNT SANDIMAN, the Davey Well Granite intrudes leucocratic granitic gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgnl) of the Halfway Gneiss and is in contact with other metagranitic units of the Durlacher Supersuite (P_-DU-mgnl, P_-DU-mgm). Farther south on LYONS RIVER the Davey Well Granite (inlcuding P_-DUda-mgmw) forms a large intrusion, which contains a lens (5 km long &times; 1 km wide) of leucocratic granitic gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgnl) of the Halfway Gneiss.   Along the northern edge of, and within, the Chalba Shear Zone, the Davey Well Granite is in faulted contact with leucocratic gneissic granite of the Halfway Gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgnl). Over a much wider area it is presumably intrusive into both the meso- and leucocratic Halfway Gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgmw, AP_-_ha-mgnl). These relationships are also evident along the southern margin of the main pluton of Davey Well Granite on YINNETHARRA.   The Davey Well Granite on YINNETHARRA, southern EUDAMULLAH and eastern LOCKIER (i.e. the Davey Well batholith), commonly contains lenses and thin layers of metamorphosed quartz diorite and tonalite (P_-DUtl-mgt) of theTetlow Granite, which have similar crystallization ages to the Davey Well Granite.  The northernmost outcrop of the Davey Well Granite, within the Mangaroon Zone on the northern part of TOWERA, is a massive, elongate body that intrudes stongly deformed pelitic and psammitic schist of the Leake Spring Metamorphics (P_-LS-mhs), although the contact between the granitic and metasedimentary rocks are not exposed. Within the Limejuice Zone on the northern part of LYNDON, another elliptical-shaped body intrudes equigranular and undeformed granitic rocks of the Moorarie Supersuite in the Minnie Creek batholith (P_-MO-gti, P_-MO-gmp) and metasedimentary rocks of the Leake Spring Metamorphics (P_-LS-mts). The western margin of this body is intruded by biotite monzogranite of the Durlacher Supersuite (P_-DU-gmpb).   The Davey Well Granite is intruded by massive metamorphosed dolerite and foliated amphibolite (P_-mod-GA), particularly east and southeast of Four Corners Well, dykes of foliated leucocratic biotite-muscovite syenogranite (P_-DU-mgrl), and a pluton of foliated leucocratic muscovite(-biotite) monzogranite (P_-DU-mgml) in the southeastern corner of EUDAMULLAH. At a site about 6 km northwest of Daly Bore on YINNETHARRA (SXSYIN007876, Zone 50, MGA 432600E 7258304N) a raft (10 m long and 1 m wide) of Davey Well Granite is present within foliated and banded medium-grained biotite metamonzogranite (P_-DU-mgmb). The Davey Well Granite is intruded by units of the Thirty Three Supersuite across the southern edge of MOUNT PHILLIPS and the adjacent northern edge of YINNETHARRA. The intruding units specifically comprise veins, dykes, and plutons of foliated, leucocratic metamonzogranite (P_-TT-jmgmt-m), and veins and dykes of leucocratic, medium-grained muscovite-tourmaline(-biotite) monzogranite (P_-TT-gmlt) and muscovite-tourmaline pegmatite (P_-TT-gpvt). ",,17,,,,4,,,,1670,7,1648,6,"Five samples of Davey Well Granite have been dated using the SHRIMP U-Pb zircon method. The resulting age ranges indicate that intrusion of the Davey Well Granite, and construction of the Davey Well batholith took place from c. 1670 to 1648 Ma.   The oldest sample dated at 1670 Â± 7 Ma (GSWA 195819, Wingate et al., 2013a) was collected from an isolated, elliptical intrusion (9 km long &times; 6 km wide) of medium-grained muscovite-biotite-tourmaline metamonzogranite about 1.2 km northeast of Bee Well on the central part of LYNDON. This unit does not form part of the Davey Well batholith but intrudes undeformed granitic rocks of the Moorarie Supersuite in the Minnie Creek batholith.  A sample (GSWA 183215, Wingate et al., 2009) of the second oldest intrusion was collected on southern EUDAMULLAH about 85 km southeast of sample GSWA 195819 (Wingate et al., 2013a) where it forms the northern margin to the Davey Well batholith. The collected specimen was a schistose, coarse-grained, strongly porphyritic biotite metamonzogranite from a low-strain zone about 2.3 km southwest of Davey Well (SXSEUD6665, Zone 50, MGA 388798E 7302568N). Zircons from this sample (GSWA 183215, Wingate et al., 2009) provided a crystallization age of 1667 Â± 4 Ma (Wingate et al., 2009), which is within uncertainty of that for the oldest sample (GSWA 195819).   Strongly deformed and metamorphosed metamonzogranite of the Davey Well Granite (GSWA 195826, Wingate et al., 2013b) was sampled on LOCKIER, about 3.7 km northwest of McCarthy Well. Although strongly tectonized, 12 zircon cores from the sample yielded a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1664 Â± 8 Ma, which is taken to be crystallization age of the Davey Well Granite (Wingate et al., 2013b). Analyses of metamorphic zircon rims yielded dates of 1321 Â± 40 Ma and 1200 Â± 3 Ma (Wingate et al., 2013b), indicating that high-grade metamorphism and deformation affected the granite during the Mutherbukin Tectonic Event.  The age of the Davey Well Granite was also determined using a sample from a small pluton within the Chalba Shear Zone on YINNETHARRA, which may form a small outlier of the Davey Well batholith. This specimen yielded a crystallization age of 1653 Â± 10 Ma (GSWA 185944, Wingate et al., 2010b).   The youngest intrusion of Davey Well Granite was sampled (GSWA 185945, Wingate et al., 2010a) within the central part of the Davey Well batholith, adjacent to where the Cobra - Dairy Creek Road crosses the Gascoyne River on YINNETHARRA. At this locality, leucocratic melt pockets related to the Edmundian Orogeny are developed within gneissic metamonzogranite. From the leucogranite a concordia age of 1648 Â± 6 Ma was obtained and interpreted as the age of magmatic crystallization of the host monzogranite. In addition, metamorphic zircon rims were dated at 1000 Â± 8 Ma, indicating that high-grade metamorphism and the production of leucocratic segregations took place during the Edmundian Orogeny (Wingate et al., 2010a).

4223,5300,P_-_de-stq,1579,Dean Quartzite,1,"Predominantly medium-grained, white, well silicified quartz sandstone; locally pebbly and conglomeratic","The Dean Quartzite (Wells et al., 1964, 1970; Close et al., 2003; Edgoose, 2013; Haines et al., 2015, 2016) is a siliciclastic unit up to 1000 m thick that forms prominent strike ridges along the southwestern margin of the Amadeus Basin in WA and the NT. Prominent features of the formation in WA include the Rawlinson, Walter James, Anne, Robert, Nyingana and Carnegie Ranges, as well as Mount Buttfield and the Schwerin Mural Crescent. It also forms prominent ridges in the Petermann, Dean and Bloods Ranges the extend into the NT. Along with the underlying Kulail Sandstone, the Dean Quartzite forms a basal siliciclastic interval to the Amadeus Basin (basal Supersequence 1 using terminology of Walter et al., 1995) that is correlated to the Heavitree Formation of the northern margin. It is overlain concordantly by the Bitter Springs Group. The Dean Quartzite is dominated by very well silicified quartz sandstone (orthoquartzite) and minor conglomerate where unmetamorphosed. Sedimentary structures are poorly preserved because of the silicification, a feature distinguishing it from the underlying Kulail Sandstone where sedimentary structures are commonly well preserved. In some areas the formation has been structurally interleaved with older rocks during the Petermann Orogeny. In these areas it may be structurally complex and has commonly been metamorphosed to paraquartzite and quartz-sericite schist (greenschist to lower amphibolite facies) that is mapped separately as informal unit P_-_de-mtq. The age of the Dean Quartzite, although not tightly constrained, is inferred to be Tonian in the range of 976-810 Ma based on regional correlation to the Heavitree Formation.","The Dean Quartzite extends along the structurally complex southwestern margin of the Amadeus Basin in Western Australia (WA) and the Northern Territory (NT). In WA it forms widespread prominent ridges in RAWLINSON, MOUNT BUTFIELD and REBECCA, with minor outcrop on the southern edge of WALLACE, the northern edge of GUNBARREL and the northeastern corner of DEERING. Prominent features comprising mainly Dean Quartzite in WA include the Rawlinson, Walter James, Anne, Robert, Nyingana and Carnegie Ranges, as well as Mount Buttfield and the Schwerin Mural Crescent. It also forms prominent ridges in the Petermann, Dean and Bloods Ranges the extend into the NT. Outcrops extend 235 km east of the WA-NT border were they are located on the PETERMANN RANGES, BLOODS RANGE and AYERS ROCK 1:250 000 map sheet areas. Further to the east the formation is absent in the Mount Kitty petroleum exploration well, where Bitter Springs Group unconformably overlies crystalline basement, suggesting that the eastern outcrop limit is close to the real eastern limit; either a primary depositional limit, or a preservational limit following an early episode of erosion. The formation is inferred to extend north beneath younger Amadeus Basin rocks to emerge as the Heavitree Formation along the northern margin. The Dean Quartzite is estimated to be up to at least 1000 m thick in the north (Nyingana and Robert Ranges). In other areas structural complications make determining the thickness difficult or impossible and it is likely to be thinner in the south.  ","The term Dean Quartzite is derived from the Dean Range straddling the WA-NT border in the DEERING (WA), REBECCA (WA) and HULL (NT) 1:100 000 scale map sheet areas. The term &quot;Dean Metamorphics&quot; was first used by Wells et al. (1961) for a stratigraphic interval which extended from the current Dean Quartzite down to parts of the underlying Tjuwata Group. The stratigraphic extent was reduced by Wells et al. (1964), and the name  revised to Dean Quartzite. A lower local feldspathic sandstone unit of the original Dean Quartzite was subsequently seperated as the Kulail Sandstone (Close et al., 2003).  No type has nominated for the Dean Quartzite.",,"The Dean Quartzite is dominated by very well silicified quartz sandstone (orthoquartzite). Grain size varies from fine to coarse, but is predominantly medium-grained. Pebbly and conglomeratic beds are present locally, with the well-rounded pebble clasts composed mostly of white vein quartz. Siltstone interbeds are rare. While typically quartz-rich, the sandstone may display slightly feldspathic intervals, and heavy mineral bands are observed locally. When freshly broken the rock is typically white to pale grey or pale blue, but with a thin orange-brown weathering skin. Locally the rock may be pervasively iron oxide stained. The strata is typically thickly bedded and blocky. While cross-beds are common, the degree of silicification often makes bedding and sedimentary structures poorly defined, and the rock may appear massive. This contrasts with the underlying Kulail Sandstone, which is more feldspathic, and commonly displays well-preserved sedimentary structures.  ","The Dean Quartzite appears to be largely of moderate- to high-energy shallow marine shelf origin, but may include some deltaic or fluvial facies. Silicification masks sedimentary structures in most outcrops so depositional environments can be hard to determine.",,1000,,"Where the structure is simple the Dean Quartzite overlies the Kulail Sandstone, but elsewhere it may be in thrust contact with underlying rocks. In most localities the point of contact between Dean Quartzite and Kulail Sandstone is obscured by scree, but it is clearly exposed at PWHROB000056 (Zone 52 424519E 7283331N) in the Robert Range. At this location the contact is sharp, but there is no evidence of erosion between the massive medium-grained silicified quartz sandstone of the basal Dean Quartzite, and the underlying more recessive fine- to medium-grained, thin- to medium-bedded sandstone of the top Kulail Sandstone. The contact is thus interpreted as conformable. At some locations units of silicified sandstone resembling the Dean Quartzite are interbedded near the top of the Kulail Sandstone, suggesting that the contact might also be gradational. In the NT the contact is likewise reported as varying from sharp to gradational (Close et al., 2003). The upper contact with the Bitter Springs Group is regionally inferred to be conformable, but is not well exposed in WA.",,17,,,,4,,,,976,,810,,"A sample of Dean Quartzite from the Robert Range has been analysed for detrital zircon age spectrum (GSWA 199404; Wingate et al., 2015; Haines et al., 2015, 2016). The youngest date of 1039 Â± 35 Ma (1&sigma;) obtained from a single analysis from this sample provides a maximum depositional age for the sandstone. A more conservative estimate of the maximum depositional age is 1120 Â± 29 Ma for the weighted mean date of the nine youngest analyses. Detrital zircon dating of the Dean Quartzite in the NT is reported by Camacho et al. (2015), but does not provide any younger constraints. The detrital zircon dates are older than an estimate based on the regional correlation of the Dean Quartzite with the upper Heavitree Formation of the northern Amadeus Basin. The Heavitree Formation is younger than the Central Desert Dolerite which has yielded dates of 976 Â± 3 Ma (zircon) and 972 Â± 8 Ma (baddelyite) (Wyborn et al., 1998). It is separated from the younger Loves Creek Formation, which has a inferred age of 810-790 Ma based on global chemostratigraphic correlations (Klaebe et al., 2017, and references therein), by the thick Gillen Formation. Therefore an age within the broad range of 976-810 Ma is applied.   ",No,,,6,,No,DE in Progress,No,No,P_,_de,,,,,MIGSDPH,2.02E+13,,No,No

It was intersected between the Bight Basin succession and Precambrian basement in drillhole GSWA FOR010, between 249 and 358 m drilled depth. The age is unconstrained except by bioturbation (which indicates a Phanerozoic age) and overlying Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, but it is inferred to be middle or lower Paleozoic from the resemblance to other lower Paleozoic sandstones in western and central Australia. The detrital zircon population from one sample resembles that from other Supersequence 4 rocks of the Centrlian Superbasin, implying an early or mid Cambrian age. The detrital zircon population from one sample resembles that from other Supersequence 4 rocks of the Centralian Superbasin, implying an early or mid-Cambrian age.","The Decoration Sandstone has to date only been intersected in one drillhole, FOR010, immediately above Mesoproterozoic metagranite of the Forrest Zone (Coompana Province) beneath the Bight and Eucla Basins. It consists of an upper claystone from 249 to 255 m drilled depth, and a sandstone-dominated interval from 255 to 358 m. The detrital zircon population present in one sample from the unit suggests a Cambrian age, in which case it may correlate with, or be part of, the Wirrildar beds or Trainor Hills Sandstone, which are exposed to the north and northeast. ","The Decoration Sandstone is named after Decoration Cave, one of the few named topographic features near the drillhole that intersected the sandstone. The type section is the only known intersection, in drillhole FOR010 between 249 and 358 m drilled depth.",,"The description below is paraphrased from Reynolds (2014).  The Decoration Sandstone has a conglomeritic base, and consists of alternating sections of irregular bedded sandstone, planar laminated sandstone and massive fining up sandstone. It can also be divided into four sections based on the amount of oxidation - a basal hematite rich, oxidised zone from 312 m to 358 m, a transition zone from 295 m to 312 m, an upper section from 255 m to 295 m which is reduced and creamy white, and an uppermost mottled green and red claystone, consisting of very fine grained mudstone to claystone. This is faintly laminated in places with some pyrite present, and rests sharply on the underlying sandstone.  The lower section consists of a basal pebbly conglomerate with several pebbly horizons and alternating >1 m beds of planar and irregular bedded sands. The irregular bedded sands have a distinctive wavy/irregular texture, and are bioturbated. The sand is quartz dominated with minor hematite and lithics. Grain size ranges from <0.1 mm to 0.5 mm and average 0.3 mm. The sand is moderately to poorly sorted with finer silty grains tending to be angular with low sphericity, whereas coarser grains are highly spherical and well rounded.  The upper section is lithologically and texturally similar to the basal section. However, the pebble conglomerate and hematite staining are absent, and pyrite nodules are common. The interval also has fine green muddy laminations with similar texture to the wavy bedding in the lower section. There is also evidence for soft sediment deformation.  Reynolds S 2013, Stratigraphic evolution of the southern Australian onshore Bight Basin: a record for the breakup of Gondwana during the Cretaceous: Hons thesis, Curtin University, Perth, 60p.",The bioturbation in the sandstone inicates a coastal setting for much of the unit.

The base is a pyroxenite grading to dolerite to a granophyric zone just above centre, which is overlain by a dolerite with a chilled margin at the top. Roberts and Elias (1990), summarize five major zones, from the base to top, as:        Zone 1. A medium-grained pyroxene orthocumulate with a doleritic base. The pyroxenite has less than 10% feldspar and has a bulk MgO of 18 wt % (Neumayr et al., 2004).   Zone 2. A porphyritic dolerite where amphibole has pseudomorphed clusters of orthopyroxene and pyroxene in the matrix. There is an upwards trend of decreasing mafic content and increasing tabular plagioclase.   Zone 3. An equigranular dolerite, marked by the absence of mafic phenocrysts. Plagioclase has a tabular habit. Granophyric intergrowth of quartz-plagioclase comprises 10% of the groundmass (Neumayr et al., 2004) and irregular coarse pegmatitic intergrowths. Titanite commonly mantles mafic and plagioclase grains.   Zone 4. Quartz granophyre. Matrix comprises greater than 10% quartz and plagioclase. The morphology of pseudomorphed pyroxene changes from equant to bladed. Accessory phases include magnetite-titanite-ilmenite. The centre of the zone can comprise up to 70% spherulitic granophyre (Neumayr et al., 2004).   Zone 5. Transitional from Zone 4 to a medium- to fine-grained dolerite. Contains bladed pseudomorphed pyroxene and less than 10% granophyric quartz-albite. Tabular plagioclase is absent. Grain size decreases to a chilled margin, which comprises radiating clusters of elongate ex-pyroxene.    <br type=""_moz"" />
Clark et al. 1986, subdivided the Defiance dolerite, at the Victory Mine into ten zones. These zones are a finer division of the five zones mention above. Minor differences include the presence of magnetite in Zone 2, and parts of Zone. Biotite and calcite alteration are prominent in the granophyric phases in association with mineralisation (Clark et al., 1986). The Defiance Dolerite is a gold target in the St Ives area near Kambalda is associated with intense biotite-pyrite alteration and is structurally controlled (Clark et al., 1986).

Away from the margins the granodiorite is medium- to coarse-grained and equigranular and may exhibit a weak solid state deformation fabric. Rare rounded relict phenocrysts of microcline can be found in the granular matrix. At the margins there is a strong solid state deformation fabric for several hundred meters.   Hornblende comprises up to 10% of the rock with a generally porphyroblastic habit and is locally associated with green clinopyroxene (originally about 2-3%, but now largely replaced by epidote and amphibole). Plagioclase (70%) is dominantly oligoclase but with thin albitic rims and patches, apparently partial melt products. The other major constituent is quartz (10%), which can exhibit a mild gneissose fabric. Subordinate minerals include epidote, apatite, allanite, titanate, opaques and secondary biotite/ stilpnomelane. Most of the mafic minerals occur in small aggregates, and are derived, or closely associated with the clinopyroxene. The textural features of this igneous body, together with the hornblende-clinopyroxene mineralogy, indicate that it has experienced middle to upper amphibolite facies metamorphism (Hunter, 1993). Cassidy and Champion (2002) classified the granite as a mafic granite.  Potassium radiometric data highlights the granodiorite from other local and regional felsic intrusives.

390,25879,P_-SOdd-xmb-mf,389,Ding Dong Downs Volcanics,1,"Amygdaloidal metabasalt and amphibolite, metadolerite, metarhyolite, and metasedimentary rock","The Ding Dong Downs Volcanics form a significant part of the 1912-1904 Ma Sophie Downs Suite. They are best exposed in the Saunders Creek Dome, Brim Anticline, and Castle Creek Anticline on northeastern HALLS CREEK and northwestern ANTRIM. The formation consists of both metamorphosed mafic and felsic rocks, metamorphosed volcaniclastic rocks, and intercalated metasedimentary rocks. Although a depositional setting cannot be confidently established, it is possible that the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics were formed in a rift environment. The formation has been directly dated from three samples at c. 1912-1904 Ma.","The Ding Dong Downs Volcanics is exposed in two areas in the Eastern Zone of the Lamboo Province, Halls Creek Orogen. The formation is best exposed northeast of Sophie Downs Homestead (Halls Creek, Zone 52, MGA 374524E 7988000N), between the Duffer Range (MCINTOSH, Zone 52, MGA 375994E 8003004N) and the Albert Edward Range and in the Saunders Creek area (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 391818E 8004890N). The second location is further south in the McClintock Range (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 323993E 7915980N), about 40 km south of the Great Northern Highway at the end of the Old Ballara Road.  The largest and best-known exposures crop out as numerous north-northeasterly trending inliers associated with structural domes and in the cores of anticlines. Moving progressively east from Sophie Downs Homestead, the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics crop out on the Sophie Downs Dome, Brim Anticline, and the Saunders Creek Dome on HALLS CREEK. The formation is exposed in the core of the north-northeasterly trending Castle Creek Anticline on northeast HALLS CREEK and northwest ANTRIM (Blake et al., 1999a,b, 2000; Phillips et al., 2016). On the Sophie Downs Dome, the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics crops out as thin units conformable or disconformable on the Sophie Downs Granite on the southeastern tip of the dome (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 375473 7989551) and a 4 km long thin unit on the eastern side of the dome (HALLS CREKK, Zone 52, MGA 381991 7993557; Blake et al., 1999a,b). The core of the north-northeasterly trending Brim Anticline is 14 km long and up to 1.5 km wide. It is composed of felsic and minor mafic metavolcanic rocks of the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics. The north-northeasterly trending Saunders Creek Dome is an irregular lens-shaped basement inlier, 600 m wide at the northern and southern ends and up to 4.5 km wide in the centre of the dome. The dome is dominated by mafic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics with minor felsic units on the southeastern margin of the dome. The similarly north-northeasterly trending Castle Creek Anticline is another basement inlier dominated by the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics. The core of the anticline is 12 km long and up to 1.5 km wide. Felsic metavolcanic and metavolcaniclastic units dominate the core with smaller outcrops of mafic metavolcanic units.  Smaller exposures crop out in the McClintock Range - Taylor Lookout area on southern DOCKRELL. South of Taylor Lookout (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 321759E 7909295N) and east of Esaw Bore (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 320362E 7907754N), the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics are exposed in the core of the northeast-trending Taylor Lookout Anticline. North of the abandoned Bulara Well (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 315393E 7902802N), the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics are exposed as a thin fault-bound or unconformity-bound unit between the Saunders Creek Formation and Esaw Monzogranite (Griffin and Tyler, 1993; Tyler et al., 1998; Tyler, 2004).","The Ding Dong Downs Formation was named by Smith (1963), but later renamed the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (Dow and Gemuts, 1969) and was originally included as the basal formation of the Halls Creek Group (Smith et al., 1963; Dow et al., 1964; Dow and Gemuts, 1969; Page and Hancock, 1988). However, mapping of a significant unconformity between the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics and overlying Saunders Creek Formation around the Saunders Creek Dome (Hancock and Rutland, 1984; Hancock, 1991) indicates that the formation could be significantly older than the Halls Creek Group and it was then removed from the group and placed into a separate formation (Griffin and Tyler, 1993). Griffin and Tyler (1993) considered the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (and Sophie Downs Granite) to constitute part of the Lamboo Complex - a term subsequently removed from use (Sheppard et al., 2012). The Ding Dong Downs Volcanics, together with the Sophie Downs Granite and other age equivalent granites, was subsequently included in the Sophie Downs Suite (Wyborn in Budd et al., 2001; Phillips et al., 2016). The type area for the formation is in the Saunders Creek Dome on HALLS CREEK.",,"The Ding Dong Downs Volcanics consist of metamorphosed mafic and felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks intercalated with metasedimentary rocks. The formation has been well studied in the Saunders Creek Dome on HALLS CREEK where the lithologies primarily consist of metamorphosed mafic rocks with intercalated metasedimentary rocks and lesser metamorphosed felsic rocks. The formation in the Saunders Creek Dome is dominated by metabasalt. These metabasalts consist of phenocrysts of amphibole and plagioclase up to 1 mm long in a groundmass altered to epidote-quartz-feldspar-chlorite with lesser ilmentite, titanite, and hematite. Metabasalt forms flows up to 3 m thick. Flow tops are commonly amygdaloidal with amygdales filled by chlorite, quartz, and/or epidote (Phillips et al., 2016). Intercalated metasedimentary rocks are green, thin-bedded, and fine-grained metasandstone and metasiltstone which commonly display bedding-parallel, medium to strong foliation, which is locally mylonitic (Blake et al., 1999b). Metasandstone and metasiltstone units are cleaved, with quartz, carbonate, and opaque oxides along cleavage planes. No original minerals are preserved. Some of the flow edges are brecciated, with clasts of metabasalt grading into metasandstone and metasiltstone, disrupting rarely preserved remnants of sedimentary bedding (Phillips et al., 2016). These are possibly peperite. These metabasalt and metasedimentary rocks on the Sophie Downs Dome have been metamorphosed to lower amphibolite facies and locally retrogressed to chlorite-epidote-albite-bearing assemblages (Phillips et al., 2016). Mafic units around Taylor Lookout on DOCKRELL consist of amygdaloidal metabasalt with up to 2 mm long feldspar phenocrysts pseudomorphed by intergrowths of epidote, sericite, plagioclase, and quartz in a fine- to medium-grained groundmass of amphibole, epidote, plagioclase, and quartz (Tyler et al., 1998). In the core of the Taylor Lookout Anticline, the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics is intruded by the c. 1788 Ma San Sou Monzogranite. At this location, the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics consists of weakly foliated amygdaloidal, metabasalt, metagabbro, and meta-anorthosite with minor calc-silicate rock metamorphosed to greenschist or epidote-amphibolite facies, possibly due to the intrusion of the San Sou Monzogranite (Tyler et al., 1998). North of Bulara Well (DOCKRELL, Zone 51, MGA 315596E 7902801N), the formation is strongly foliated and layered, with medium-grained amphibolite containing hornblende, biotite, plagioclase, and quartz with feldspar altered to epidote and sericite (Tyler et al., 1998).  Felsic rocks dominate the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics in the Brim Anticline and Castle Creek Anticline and include metarhyolite, feldspar-phyric, quartz-phyric, and aphyric units. Feldspar-phyric rocks contain glomerocrysts of quartz-feldspar (feldspar altered to carbonate). Granophyric quartz and feldspar are in areas of coarser grained groundmass. Quartz-phyric rocks contain euhedral phenocrysts of quartz up to 0.7 mm wide in a groundmass dominated by quartz and mica with accessory chlorite and epidote (Phillips et al., 2016). Some of the metarhyolite in the Brim Anticline is flow banded, but Blake (1991) suggested that most of the metarhyolite represents fragmental volcanic material rather than lava flows.","Metasedimentary rocks within the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics are too deformed and altered to interpret a depositional setting. However, some lithologies may have had volcaniclastic protoliths. The geochemical characteristics of the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics share continental and backarc affinities. Ogasawara (1988) suggested that the Sophie Downs Suite could have formed in a rift environment.",,,,"The Ding Dong Downs Volcanics is a metamorphosed volcano-sedimentary age equivalent to granitic intrusions in the Sophie Downs Suite. A xenolith of an altered felsic igneous rock within the Esaw Monzogranite of the Sophie Downs Suite near Esaw Bore (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 320362E 7907754N) may be derived from the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics, indicating an intrusive relationship. At Bulara Well (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 315393E 7902802N), a local unconformable relationship has been mapped between the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics and the Esaw Monzogranite (Tyler et al., 1998). In the Sophie Downs Dome, north of Sophie Downs Homestead (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 374524E 7988000N), thin units of the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics conformably overlie the Sophie Downs Granite.  The Halls Creek Group unconformably overlies the Sophie Downs Suite (including the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics). The basal unit of the Halls Creek Group, Saunders Creek Formation unconformably overlies the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics. This relationship is seen around the Saunders Creek Dome on HALLS CREEK and on the western limb of the Castle Creek Anticline on northeastern HALLS CREEK and northwestern ANTRIM. Shear zone contacts have been noted around the Saunders Creek Dome. The Ding Dong Downs Volcanics are also unconformably overlain by the Brim Rockhole Formation of the Halls Creek Group on the east-central flank of the Sophie Downs Dome and the whole of the Brim Anticline on Halls Creek. This unconformable surface is not obviously erosive, but represents the strong topographic control that the Sophie Downs Suite exerted on the deposition of the Halls Creek Group (Phillips et al., 2016). The Ding Dong Downs Volcanics - and the Sophie Downs Granite and entire Halls Creek Group - is intruded by the c. 1835 Ma Woodward Dolerite. These intrusive relationships are uncommon, but are seen on the southwestern end of the Sophie Downs Dome and in the core of the Castle Creek Anticline on HALLS CREEK and ANTRIM. The Ding Dong Downs Volcanics are intruded by the San Sou Monzogranite in the Taylor Lookout area on DOCKRELL (Tyler et al., 1998).",,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,1912,3,1904,5,"The age of the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics is well constrained to 1912-1904 Ma by three samples. A metamorphosed, fragmentary foliated, and fragmental felsic volcanic rock from the core of the Brim Anticline (GA 93526009, Blake et al., 1999b, HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 382810E, 7993117N) yielded a weighted mean 207Pb*/206Pb* date of 1912 Â± 3 Ma from 32 analyses that were <5% discordant (Blake et al., 1999a,b). Similarly, another metamorphosed fragmentary foliated and fragmental felsic volcanic rock from the northern end of the Saunders Creek Dome (GA 88598005, Blake et al., 1999b, HALLS CREEK, MGA Zone 52 390632E, 8000774N) yielded a weighted mean 207Pb*/206Pb* date of 1910 Â± 5 Ma from 30 analyses that were <5% discordant (Blake et al., 1999b; Phillips et al., 2016). These ages are interpreted to be the age of volcanism in the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics. Another sample from the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics, a quartzofeldspathic muscovite-bearing gneiss from the west-central Saunders Creek Dome, is considered to be a mylonitic felsic volcanic rock (GSWA 206150, Kirkland et al., 2015; HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 386980E 7995934N). This sample yielded a weighted mean 207Pb*/206Pb* date of 1904 Â± 5 Ma from 49 analyses that were <5% discordant, interpreted to be the age of the volcanic protolith (Kirkland et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2016).  The Ding Dong Downs Volcanics are unconformably overlain by the Brim Rockhole Formation of the Halls Creek Group. The Brim Rockhole Formation contains a felsic volcanic unit which has been dated at 1881 Â± 3 Ma. It is interpreted as the age of volcanism (GA 93526012, Blake et al., 1999b; HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 379214E, 8000834N; Blake et al., 1999a,b; Phillips et al., 2016).

It characteristically contains thin, tabular K-feldspar phenocrysts defining a trachytic texture. The Dingo Creek Granite is widely distributed in the Mangaroon Zone in the northern part of the province as a series of intrusions parallel to the structural grain of the surrounding metasedimentary rocks. Three specimens from the unit sampled for SHRIMP U-Pb zircon geochronology by Pearson (1996) and GSWA have yielded igneous crystallization ages of c. 1675 Ma. ","The unit forms several southeast-trending intrusions throughout the Mangaroon Zone (from TOWERA to MOUNT AUGUSTUS) in the northern part of the province, and two small and isolated intrusions in the Limejuice Zone on southern MOUNT PHILLIPS and northwestern PINK HILLS.  On TOWERA, LYNDON and the western part of MANGAROON, the Dingo Creek Granite forms three elongate intrusions, the largest being 40 km in length and up to 4 km in width. The other intrusions are generally  8-12 km long and <1.5 km wide. On the central part of MANGAROON the granites cover an area that is about 35 km long and 10 km wide. The area also includes the largest intrusion of the Dingo Creek Granite, measuring 26.5 km in length and 8 km in width (122 km 2 ). A similar southeast-striking belt of intrusions is present on EDMUND and the northeastern corner of MOUNT PHILLIPS. More than 20 km to the southeast is an isolated exposure of Dingo Creek Granite amidst regolith, suggesting that this unit may also underlie part of northwestern MOUNT AUGUSTUS.  In addition, two small plugs in the southern Limejuice Zone have been assigned to the Dingo Creek Granite. The first plug has a size of about 2 km 2  and is situated northeast of Kendell Bore in the southeastern part of MOUNT PHILLIPS. The second plug lies southwest of No. 1 Bore on PINK HILLS and covers about 0.5 km 2 .  The Dingo Creek Granite forms low, rugged hills, and outcrops as boulders, tors, and, locally, whalebacks.","The Dingo Creek Granite was named after Dingo Creek (Zone 50, MGA 409500E 7363500N) on EDMUND. The Dingo Creek Granite was initially referred to as the Dingo Granite by Pearson (1996) and Pearson et al. (1996). Nevertheless, due to potential confusion with the Dingo intrusion in the Pilbara, it was later renamed to Dingo Creek Granite.",,"Throughout the Mangaroon and Limejuice Zones, intrusions of the Dingo Creek Granite are mostly composed of discrete southeast-striking sheets with a width ranging from a few up to several hundred metres. The Dingo Creek Granite is composed of porphyritic, fine- to medium-grained biotite-muscovite monzogranite and syenogranite, with abundant thin (2-5 mm), tabular K-feldspar phenocrysts mostly <1 cm long. The phenocrysts usually comprise 30% or more of the rock, but locally they may make up to 60% of the rock (Pearson, 1996) and commonly have a strong preferred orientation (i.e. trachytic texture) defining a magmatic foliation. This foliation typically strikes southeast parallel to the regional S 2m  foliation (late Paleoproterozoic Mangaroon Orogeny) in rocks of the surrounding Pooranoo Metamorphics, and dips steeply to the northeast or southwest. Phenocrysts of microperthite commonly contain inclusions of plagioclase and blebby quartz. Chocolate-brown biotite and muscovite are partly recrystallized to finer grained aggregates.  On TOWERA and LYNDON, the Dingo Creek Granite appears to be transitional with leucocratic, medium-grained muscovite-tourmaline(-biotite) monzogranite (P_-DU-gmvt). On the eastern margin of LYNDON the Dingo Creek Granite appears as a <400 m thick layer within abundant muscovite-tourmaline(-biotite) monzogranite (P_-DU-gmvt). The contact (e.g. SPJGAS001576; Zone 50, MGA 341312E 7380254N) is marked by a gradual increase in the proportion of K-feldspar phenocrysts and a decrease in disseminated matrix tourmaline from the monzogranite of the Dingo Creek Granite. Locally, most intrusions of the Dingo Creek Granite on LYNDON contain minor (<1%), finely disseminated matrix tourmaline. Its amount varies inversely with the proportion of thin K-feldspar phenocrysts. ",,,,,"The Dingo Creek Granite outcrops mainly in the Mangaroon Zone in the northern part of the province. It is therefore mostly surrounded by contemporaneous to slightly younger igneous rocks of the Durlacher Supersuite and older metasedimentary rocks of the Pooranoo Metamorphics.  On TOWERA and LYNDON, the Dingo Creek Granite appears to be transitional to muscovite-tourmaline(-biotite) monzogranite (P_-DU-gmvt). Although the Dingo Creek Granite forms discrete kilometre-scale intrusions, it also forms metre- to decametre-wide discontinuous layers within the muscovite-tourmaline(-biotite) monzogranite. The contacts between the two are diffuse and grade into each other with the loss or gain of K-feldspar phenocrysts and tourmaline. The discrete intrusions show intrusive contacts with older metasedimentary siliciclatic rocks of the Pooranoo Metamorphics (P_-PO-mtsf and P_-PO-xmtsf-gmv) and schlieric granodiorite (P_-DU-ggvs), which is one of the oldest phases in the Durlacher Supersuite. Several intrusions of the Dingo Creek Granite are unconformably overlain by sedimentary rocks of the Yilgatherra Formation (P_-MEy-st) of the Edmund Group.  On MANGAROON, the Dingo Creek Granite is mainly surrounded by large areas of the Pimbyana Granite (P_-DUpi-gmw). At the margins of separate intrusions about 4.5 km southeast of Coorabie Tank (SXSMAN6245, Zone 50, MGA 385760E 7367230N), 2 km east of Chararoo Outcamp (Zone 50, MGA 370940E 7386770N), and on EDMUND, fine- to medium-grained porphyritic granite of the Dingo Creek Granite intrudes megacrystic monzogranite of the Pimbyana Granite. In the area about 2 km northeast of Chararoo Outcamp there are numerous inclusions and rafts of megacrystic Pimbyana Granite in Dingo Creek Granite. Around Doorawarrah Spring on MANGAROON the Dingo Creek Granite intrudes rocks of the Pooranoo Metamorphics. On EDMUND rafts of leucocratic tourmaline-bearing granite (P_-DU-gmvt) are locally present within the Dingo Creek Granite.  The Dingo Creek Granite is extensively intruded by veins and dykes of muscovite-biotite(-tourmaline) granite and pegmatite (P_-DU-gmv, P_-DU-gmvt, P_-DU-gpt). On MANGAROON the Dingo Creek Granite is intruded by a dolerite sill of the c. 1465 Ma Narimbunna Dolerite, and is faulted against the Yilgatherra Formation at the base of the Edmund Group.",,17,,,,4,,,,1674,8,1674,8,"The Dingo Creek Granite was first dated by Pearson (1996) using SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dating.

It is a poorly exposed intrusion, in which outcrops commonly consist of scattered boulders and isolated low hills amongst colluvial plains.","The Dinner Creek Tonalite is named after Dinner Creek, which flows into Bow River near Lissadell Hill in the eastern part of BOW.",,"Rocks in the Dinner Creek Tonalite vary from fine grained and weakly porphyritic to medium grained (2-3 mm) and equigranular. Phenocrysts consist of subhedral plagioclase and hypersthene. Phenocryst and groundmass plagioclase have mottled calcic cores commonly separated from narrow sodic rims by a region of strong oscillatory zoning. The groundmass consists of subhedral to anhedral granular plagioclase, quartz (~20%), biotite (10-15%), actinolite (~5%), and rare microcline. Rare examples of antiperthitic textures are present in some groundmass plagioclase crystals. Accessory minerals include opaque minerals, apatite, zircon, and allanite. Plagioclase crystals are moderately to strongly altered to very fine grained clinozoisite and minor sericite. Associated with this alteration is replacement of ?magnetite by epidote. Hypersthene in most samples is pseudomorphed by a weakly pleochroic, very pale green tremolite-actinolite. Where it is well preserved, hypersthene is rimmed by actinolite and shows incipient replacement by biotite along fractures. Biotite is reddish or orange-brown and typically shows exsolution of ?Fe-Ti oxide needles and granular epidote along grain boundaries.  The prominent mafic inclusions in the Dinner Creek Tonalite are of fine-grained, weakly porphyritic and equigranular tonalite. The inclusions are very dark grey, typically rounded to subangular, and 2-5 cm in diameter. The inclusions are commonly identical to the host rock, except for their finer grain size and metamorphic textures.

It consists of grey dolomite and limestone, dark grey to black siltstone and mudstone, with sandstone in intersections away from Shark Bay. It contains a thick, bedded halite unit, the Yaringa Formation, in the Yaringa - Hamelin Pool area, and anhydrite is common throughout the group, both disseminated and as veins. Bed-by-bed electric-log correlations can be made over long distances (Yaringa 1 to Tamala 1 for example), indicating layer cake basin geometry. It was deposited in shallow to very shallow, largely restricted, low-energy marine and coastal settings. The main depocentre appears to have been the Shark Bay area, with the greatest thickness of the group probably about 1100 m between Shark Bay and about 24 degrees south. The thickest complete intersection is 739 m, the type section in Dirk Hartog 17B. Sections thin to the south and east away from the Dirk Hartog Island area. Age control for the group is sparse, with conodont faunas indicating the base is late Ordovcian (Ashgillian, or mid-Katian), and the top late Silurian (latest Ludfordian to Pridoli).","The depocentre of the Dirk Hartog Group lies in the outer Shark Bay area, with the thickest intersection in Dirk Hartog 17B (739 m), and a section that did not reach the base of the group of 645 m in Pendock 1 offshore to the north. Iasky et al. (2003) considered the group thickened to about 1100 m between the north of Shark Bay and about 24 degrees south. The thickness lessens progressively to the east, with 607.4 m in Hamelin Pool 1 and 579 m in Yaringa, and to the south with 527 m in Tamala 1 and 405.5 m in Coburn 1. To the northeast, parts of the group have been recognized as far as Wandagee 1, Quail 1, and Marrilla 1.  Bedding is remarkably persistent laterally on a fine scale, based on comparison of electric logs in petroleum exploration wells (Hocking et al., 1987), with bed-by-bed correlations over nearly 100 km (Hamelin Pool 1 to Tamala 1). The precision of correlation over 15 to 20 km (Hamelin Pool 1 to Yaringa 1, Wandagee 1 to Quail 1) is sufficient to reveal the presence of small faults. Hocking et al. (1987) noted about 20 m of sediment was deposited in the Yaringa 1 area before deposition commenced at Tamala 1, and approximately 15 m was deposited at Tamala 1 before deposition of the Dirk Hartog Group began at Kalbarri 1, the southernmost intersection.","The Dirk Hartog Group was named and briefly described, as &quot;Dirk Hartog Limestone&quot;, by McWhae et al. (1958). Henderson and Shannon (1966) used &quot;Dirk Hartog Formation&quot; in the Yaringa 1 Well Completion Report, and this usage was formalized by Playford et al. (1975), who also formalized Henderson and Hannon's &quot;Unit B&quot; as the Yaringa Evaporite Member. Gorter et al. (1994) elevated the unit to Dirk Hartog Group, and named the informal units recognised by earlier workers, as Ajana Formation (lowest), Yaringa Evaporite, and Hamelin Formation (top). The Ajana Formation corresponded to Henderson ans Shannon's Units C and D, and the 'Hamelin Formation' to Unit A. Mory et al. (1998) replaced the Hamelin Formation with Coburn Formation, as 'Hamelin' was pre-empted by the Quaternary Hamelin Coquina, and recognized the Marron Member in the lower Ajana Formation, which corresponded to Henderson and Shannon's Unit D.   The group is named after Dirk Hartog Island, and the type section is in Dirk Hartog 17B, a deep stratigraphic test well on the island, between 665 and 1404 m, although Gorter et al. (1994) gave the base as 1400 m. The group is overlain disconformably by the latest Silurian or early Devonian Faure Formation, and overlies the Boolagoorda Sandstone with apparent conformity.",,"The Dirk Hartog Group consists of grey dolomite and limestone, dark grey to black siltstone and mudstone, with sandstone in intersections away from Shark Bay.

(2003) summarized the lithology of the group. The lowermost unit, the Ajana Formation, consists of two major shoaling-upwards cycles, overlain by more massive carbonates that form the upper Ajana Formation (Gorter et al., 1994). The two cycles grade up from siltstone and shale with a characteristically high gamma ray response and common anhydrite as grains and veins, commonly greenish to reddish but in some intersections dark grey to black. These become progressively more dolomitic and sandy upwards, and are oollitic in Yaringa 1, Wandagee 1 and Quail 1. The upper cycle contains a more diverse microflora and, in its upper part, more limestone. Gorter et al. described the upper massive unit consists of interbedded ooid limestone and dolomite.  Oxidized siltstone at the base of the Ajana Formation was named the Marron Member by Mory et al. (1998), and may represent a transitional facies between the Dirk Hartog Group and the Boolagoorda Sandstone.  The Yaringa Formation consists of cryptocrystalline to microcrystalline, laminated and partially oolitic dolomite, with interbedded evaporitic dark grey shale, halite beds and anhydrite (Gorter et al., 1994) and lithoclastic grainstone. Evaporites are common throughout of the Dirk Hartog Group, but bedded halite is only present in the Yaringa Formation, in the Yaringa area. The evaporites characteristically have low bromine concentrations, suggesting they are marine. Anhydrite is common, as fracture fillings, thin beds and in nodules. A red or brown colouration is common. A correlative sandstone in Pendock 1 is described in the well completion report as white to light grey and very fine to medium grained, locally grading to coarse grained with very coarse grains. It is poorly to moderately sorted and well cemented, and grains are sub-angular.  The Coburn Formation is dominantly limestone and dolomite ranging from mudstone to grainstone, arranged in a series of coarsening-upward shoaling cycles (Yasin and Mory, 1999). It is the coarsest grained part of the Dirk Hartog Group in Coburn 1. Shoaling upwards cycles are present at scales ranging from a few metres to tens of metres, as is common in platform carbonate successions. They grade upwards from wackestone and packstone to grainstone, with dolomite and evaporitic textures and content (as disseminated grains, nodules and veins) more common in the upper parts of cycles, within grainstone intervals.","The Dirk Hartog Group was deposited primarily in shallow to very shallow marine, and coastal environments, commonly with restricted circulation. These were commonly saline and hypersaline, with thick halite-dominated evaporite beds characterizing the Yaringa Formation.",,739,,"Yasin and Mory (1999) recorded a sharp, abrupt contact between the Faure and Coburn Formations in Coburn 1, with a sharp change from grey dolomite below to oxidised redbeds above.

Porphyritic, medium-grained monzogranite consists of 15-30% tabular phenocrysts of microcline in an anhedral or subhedral granular groundmass of microcline, oligoclase, biotite (2-7%), and small amounts of muscovite intergrown with biotite. Microcline phenocrysts commonly contain small inclusions of plagioclase, biotite, and quartz. Accessory mineral assemblages are magnetite, ilmenite, apatite, zircon, and allanite, or, in more felsic samples, magnetite, apatite, and zircon.  All samples show some degree of recrystallization and development of secondary minerals, such as weak to moderate sericite alteration of plagioclase, epidote rims on magnetite, and titanite rims on ilmenite. Granophyric textures are present in some samples.  The Discretion Granite contains inclusions of porphyritic, fine-grained monzogranite and a fine-grained, equigranular, biotite-rich rock, in addition to inclusions of country rock close to the margins of the pluton.

714,,P_-TJd-s,2983,Dixon Range Formation,1,"Sandstone, arkose, siltstone, polymict conglomerate; rare stromatolitic dolomite; locally metamorphosed","The Dixon Range Formation (originally 'Dixon Range Beds': Wells et al., 1961, 1964, 1970) of the Tjauwata Group is a predominantly siliciclastic unit of the Bentley Basin that lies stratigraphically below the basal Amadeus Basin succession (Kulail Sandstone) in RAWLINSON, MOUNT BUTFIELD and REBECCA in Western Australia (WA). The contact with the Kulail Sandstone is not well exposed but is assumed to be a disconformity or unconformity. In some areas the Dixon Range Formation is in thrust contact with younger units.  The Dixon Range Formation lies at the top of the Tjauwata Group in WA and is likely to be at least partly correlative to the Bloods Range Formation, which forms the top of the Tjauwata Group further east, extending into the Northern Territory (Close et al., 2003), although it is thicker and more lithologically diverse than the latter. The maximum thickness of the formation cannot be determined due structural complications and the lack of an exposed base. The formation was deposited under a variety of depositional environments from fluvial (dominant) to eolian, and possibly shallow marine or lacustrine. An age of c. 1030 Ma is suggested from detrital zircon dating and inferred stratigraphic position.  ",The most extensive outcrops are in the Dixon Range (RAWLINSON and MOUNT BUTTFIELD) and in the low hills of the Peeyooldjara Range (MOUNT BUTTFIELD and extending east to the edge of REBECCA). Minor outcrops are found on the northern side of the Robert Range (MOUNT BUTTFIELD) and along the northern side and around the western end of the Rawlinson Range (RAWLINSON).,"The term 'Dixon Range Beds' was first used by Wells et al. (1961, 1964). The name is derived from Dixon Range which crosses the boundary between the RAWLINSON and MOUNT BUTTFIELD. This range provides the best exposures of the unit, although no type section or reference section was specified by the original authors.",,"The Dixon Range Formation is dominated by interbedded sandstone and siltstone, with conglomerate significant in some parts of the formation. The sandstone, which ranges from fine to very coarse grained, is typically mineralogically and texturally immature, being commonly lithic and feldspathic, varying to arkose in composition. Heavy mineral bands are common. Freshly broken rock typically displays abundant clay matrix from weathering of feldspar and lithic grains. An exception is informal sub-unit P_-TJd-stqo which is texturally mature (well-sorted, well-rounded) and has only minor clay matrix. Sandstone beds are commonly planar- to cross-bedded, or ripple bedded, with sub-unit P_-TJd-stqo displaying very large scale cross-bedding (foresets up to at least 6 m in thickness). Spherical concretions are common in some sandstone units. Siltstone varies from purple to grey, khaki green, red and white, and is commonly laminated. Conglomerate is typically polymict and clasts rarely get beyond pebble-size, except in the south near the Rawlinson Range, where cobble-sized clasts of quartzite are present. Carbonate is a significant, though minor component of one informal sub-unit, P_-TJd-xsf-kds. In this unit stromatolitic dolomite bioherms are interbedded with siltstone and sandstone. Southern outcrops near the Rawlinson Range are metamorphosed to phyllite, metasandstone and metaconglomerate, the latter displaying significant flattening or stretching of clasts.  ","The Dixon Range Formation was deposited under a range of depositional environments from fluvial to shallow marine (or lacustrine). Different parts of a fluvio-deltaic complex would satisfy the juxtaposition of these environments in one formation. In addition, local informal unit P_-TJd-stqo was deposited under predominantly eolian conditions.",,,,"The Dixon Range Formation is overlain by the Kulail Sandstone of the Amadeus Basin. The contact is mapped along the southern side of the Nyingana Range (over undivided Dixon Range Formation), and at the eastern end of Robert Range (over informal unit P_-TJd-ss), but is very poorly exposed in each case due to extensive scree cover. The contact is inferred to be unconformable or disconformable. The base contact with older rocks is not exposed. The Dixon Range Formation is likely to be at least partly equivalent to the Bloods Range Formation, which forms the top of the Tjauwata Group further east (Close et al., 2003), although it is thicker and more lithologically diverse than the latter. The Dixon Range Formation is locally in thrust contact with younger units such as Dean Quartzite and Bitter Springs Formation.",,99,,,,4,,,,1030,,1030,,"A maximum depositional age for the Dixon Range Formation is provided by the youngest detrital zircon analysis from GSWA geochronology sample 199408, collected from informal unit P_-TJd-st, which yielded a  207 Pb/ 206 Pb date of 1029 Â± 17 Ma (1&sigma;) (Wingate et al., 2015; Haines et al., 2015). A more conservative estimate of the maximum depositional age can be based on the weighted mean  207 Pb/ 206 Pb date of 1147 Â± 13 Ma (MSWD = 0.73) for the 17 youngest analyses, but this is significantly older than the age than can be inferred from suspected partial correlation with the Bloods Range Formation. The Dixon Range Formation must be older that the unconformably overlying Kulail Sandstone. While the age of Kulail Sandstone is itself not tightly constrained, its inferred equivalence to the lower Heavitree Formation of the northern Amadeus Basin implies an age for the Kulail Sandstone younger than ca. 976 Ma assigned to the Central Desert Dolerite Suite (Wyborne et al., 1998) that is overlain by the Heavitree Formation.

Subsequently, brief descriptions of the formation were given by Daniels (1968, 1970, 1975), de la Hunty (1964), Horwitz (1981, 1982), Seymour et al. (1988), and Williams (1966). Most work was concerned with its paleontology (Edgell, 1964; Grey 1979, 1982, 1985; Grey and Thorne, 1985; Hofmann and Schopf, 1983; Schopf et al., 2015; Knoll and Barghoorn, 1976; Knoll et al., 1988; Preiss, 1977; Walter, 1972). In addition, sedimentological and isotopic studies were done by Thorne (1985), Thorne and Seymour (1991), and Wilson et al. (2010).  No type section for the formation was defined by MacLeod et al. (1963). However, the bulk of the succession is well exposed around Duck Creek Gorge (Zone 50, MGA 430100E 7513500N) on southwestern MOUNT STUART.",,"The Duck Creek Dolomite (P_-WYd-kd) consists of thin- to very thick-bedded, buff or grey-weathering dolostone. It is commonly stromatolitic or brecciated, and silicification is locally intense. The formation is only weakly resistant to weathering and erosion and generally outcrops as low mounds and hills, and low strike ridges. The dolostones are often partially covered by a Phanerozoic silica caprock.   Two major lithofacies associations are recognized within the Duck Creek Dolomite: a thin-bedded dolostone interbedded with thin- to very thick-bedded dolostone conglomerate and breccia, and a medium- to very thick-bedded stromatolitic dolostone and breccia. The first of these associations corresponds to the outer shelf, slope-and-basin facies of Thorne and Seymour (1991) and dominates the lower and upper part of the Duck Creek Dolomite, including those outcrops on CAPRICORN. The second association, on the other hand, which is equivalent to the inner shelf facies of the same authors, forms much of the middle part of the stratigraphy.  In the first lithofacies association, thin-bedded dolostones are planar to undulatory laminated and often contain layers and nodules of red or black chert. Beds are generally interstratified with thin horizons of chloritic or ferruginous mudstone and may contain synsedimentary folds. Thin-bedded dolostone is transitional into nodular dolostone. Its texture ranges from a gentle pinch-and-swell in the dolostone layers to a complex network of interlocking nodules. Thin to very thick beds of both, clast- and matrix-supported and pebble- to boulder-dolostone breccia consist of a chaotic mixture of dolostone fragments set in a matrix of mudstone, coarsely crystalline dolomite, or sparry quartz.  The second lithofacies association is made up of recrystallized silt- and sand-sized dolostone, interbedded with pebble- to boulder-dolostone conglomerate and breccia. These rocks are characterized by a wide range of sedimentary and organo-sedimentary structures, including low-domical stromatolites, small- and large-branching columnar stromatolites, tepees, crested pseudocolumnar stromatolites, disrupted domes, and massive to cross-stratified intraclast grainstones. Domical stromatolites are generally nucleated on tabular oncoids or intraclasts. Thorne and Seymour (1991) record that this association consists of numerous repeated sequences of stromatolitic and non-stromatolitic facies, in which two types of sequence are recognized. The first is approximately 1.5 m thick and consists of an erosively based intraclast grainstone, which is succeeded by nucleated domical stromatolites and laminated dolostone. The sequence then passes upwards into a mixed assemblage of tepees, disrupted domes, low-domical stromatolites, and pseudocolumnar stromatolites. This is overlain by the next erosively based intraclast grainstone. The second type of sequence is generally 2-4 m thick and consists of an erosional intraclast grainstone overlain by small branching-columnar stromatolites. These develop upwards into large branching-columnar stromatolites, which are directly overlain by laminated dolostone. This is followed by the basal intraclast grainstone of the next sequence or by a mixed assemblage of tepees, disrupted domes, or low domical stromatolites, which is then capped by intraclast grainstone.  Evaporite minerals have not been identified in the Duck Creek Dolomite. There is, however, some evidence in the form of irregular, cross-cutting and disruptive fenestrae in the second lithofacies association, which points to their former limited development (Thorne and Seymour, 1991).  On UAROO, the Duck Creek Dolomite forms a series of kilometre-scale lenses, each up to 200 m thick, although individual lenses may be significantly thicker due to structural repetition. The unit is commonly finely laminated, massive to medium bedded and either partly or totally recrystallized. Simple domical stromatolites are rare, but good examples can be observed at sites HNCUAR003460 (Zone 50, MGA 336285E 7468872N) and HNCUAR003462 (Zone 50, MGA 336602E 7468735N). Along strike of the outcrops on UAROO, on the northwestern corner of MAROONAH, a 200 m thick and 20 km long outcrop of metamorphosed carbonate of the Leake Spring Metamorphics (P_-LS-mk) is contained within granitic rocks of the Moorarie Supersuite (P_-MO-mggn). These carbonate rocks are massive and strongly recrystallized, but are probably the metamorphosed equivalent of the Duck Creek Dolomite.","The depositional setting for the Duck Creek Dolomite is thought to have been a distally steepened carbonate ramp, in which the major break in slope is not present at the seaward margin of the offshore barrier, but many kilometres farther offshore (Thorne and Seymour, 1991). This type of carbonate shelf is thought to have developed when faulting and/or flexuring steepened the outer part of the shelf. In addition, there is evidence that some of the siliciclastic rocks of the Ashburton Formation are probably coeval with the Duck Creek Dolomite. It suggests that they were deposited in a longitudinal, deep submarine fan environment, farther offshore from the carbonate ramp.  Thin-bedded dolostone interbedded with thin- to very thick-bedded dolostone conglomerate and breccia that form the first lithofacies association are interpreted as outer shelf and slope-and-basin facies (Thorne and Seymour, 1991). Thinly bedded dolostones were deposited in a low-energy environment, which received minor amounts of terrigenous detritus in suspension. Most of the dolostones were probably fine-grained before burial and may have been carbonate suspension sediments, derived from the shelf. Thin to very thick beds of dolostone conglomerate and breccia are interpreted as submarine mass flow deposits, resulting from slumping and dislocation on the carbonate shelf slope.  Medium- to very thick-bedded stromatolitic dolostone and breccia that make up the second of the lithofacies associations were deposited in a low-gradient, coastal shelf environment. The two sequences of sedimentary facies that are repeatedly present in these rocks are interpreted as upward-shallowing sequences. They formed as a result of marine transgression and regression across a sabkha-type coastline, characterized by barrier bar, lagoonal, intertidal, and supratidal environments (Thorne, 1985; Thorne and Seymour, 1991). In this setting, the greater thickness and development of branching columnar stromatolites in a second type of upward-shallowing sequence reflects periodic deepening of the coastal lagoon.  Wilson et al. (2010) note that the carbon isotope ratios of Duck Creek Dolomite carbonates show no evidence for a strong isotopic gradient with paleowater depth. By contrast, oxygen isotopes covary strongly with paleowater depth. Positive &delta;&sup1;O values as high as 2&permil; VPDB in peritidal facies systematically decline to values of -16 to -6&permil; in basinal rocks.",,1000,,"The Duck Creek Dolomite rests conformably upon the Mount McGrath Formation, except around the western part of Wyloo Dome, where it unconformably overlies the Fortescue and Hamersley Groups. Over most of the Ashburton Basin the formation is conformably overlain by the Ashburton Formation. The only exception is north of the Wyloo Dome, where there is a gradational, conformable contact with the locally developed June Hill Volcanics.",,17,,,,4,,,,2008,,1799,,"The age of the Duck Creek Dolomite is poorly constrained, but was deposited sometime between c. 2008 and 1799 Ma. The older age limit for the Duck Creek Dolomite is provided by the c. 2008 Ma older age limit for the Wyloo Group, based on its unconformable relationship to northwest-trending dolerite dykes in the underlying Shingle Creek Group, formerly the lower Wyloo Group (M&uuml;ller et al., 2005).  The younger age limit for the formation is given by the SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 1799 Â± 8 Ma (Evans et al., 2003), obtained from the locally developed June Hill Volcanics that conformably overlies the Duck Creek Dolomite on the 1:250 000 sheet WYLOO. Wilson et al. (2010) recorded a similar age of 1795 Â± 7 Ma from the same unit, that apparently is in direct contact with the Duck Creek Dolomite, although no sample coordinates or detailed stratigraphic relationships were provided. Despite this younger age limit, depositional ages of 1806 Â± 9 Ma (GSWA 148922, Nelson, 2004) and 1829 Â± 5 Ma (Sircombe, 2003) have been obtained from felsic volcanic units in the upper part of the Ashburton Formation, which apparently stratigraphically overlie the Duck Creek Dolomite. Furthermore, SHRIMP U-Pb dates of 1804 Â± 7 Ma, 1800 Â± 7 Ma, and 1801 Â± 6 Ma (Hall et al., 2001; Wingate et al., 2017a,b) have been obtained from accretionary lapilli tuffs within the Koonong Member of the Capricorn Group that unconformably overlies the Ashburton Formation.   These results suggest that sedimentation across the Ashburton Basin was probably diachronous (Tyler and Thorne, 1990; Thorne and Seymour, 1991; Evans et al., 2003) so that the Duck Creek Dolomite, June Hill Volcanics, and Ashburton Formation are partly coeval and probably represent a carbonate shelf margin and its equivalent offshore deep submarine fan complex, respectively.",No,,,3,,No,Published,No,Yes,P_,WYd,,,,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

The granodiorite is characterized by spindly phenocrysts of K-feldspar, which constitute up to 30% of the rock. Allanite crystals up to 1.5 mm long are a common and widespread feature of the unit. Two samples of the granodiorite have been dated, with ages within uncertainty of each other at c. 1810 Ma.","The Dumbie Granodiorite (P_-MOdu-ggp) is extensively exposed on northern GLENBURGH. On northeastern GLENBURGH, and on adjacent northwestern LANDOR and the southern part of PINK HILLS, the Dumbie Granodiorite forms a large pluton of at least 76 km 2 . The Dumbie Granodiorite forms large sheets intruded subparallel to the regional structural grain such as those on southeastern YINNETHARRA and southwestern PINK HILLS; it also forms numerous dykes. The Dumbie Granodiorite also outcrops within the Chalba Shear Zone on western YINNETHARRA and westwards onto LOCKIER, as fault-bounded domains. The Dumbie Granodiorite outcrops as boulders, tors, and scattered whalebacks.","The Dumbie Granodiorite (Occhipinti and Sheppard, 2000) is named after Dumbie Well in the northern part of GLENBURGH (Zone 50, MGA 434300E 7203800N), where the granodiorite is widely exposed.",,"The most abundant rock type in the Dumbie Granodiorite is a grey, fine- to medium-grained granodiorite (or less commonly monzogranite) with up to 30% thin tabular phenocrysts of sanidine or microcline up to 1 cm long. Locally on LANDOR, phenocrysts reach 3 cm in length. In places the phenocrysts are oval in shape. K-feldspar phenocrysts contain numerous small inclusions of round quartz and subhedral plagioclase. A few phenocrysts have minor development of microperthite. The groundmass consists of anhedral granular, fine-grained plagioclase, quartz, green-brown biotite, and minor microcline. Biotite is commonly recrystallized and aligned in the foliation Accessory minerals comprise magnetite, ilmenite, allanite, zircon, and apatite. The large pluton on southern PINK HILLS comprises at least 30% 5-30 mm-long flattened K-feldspar phenocrysts that are strongly aligned within the regional fabric. The phenocrysts are set within a biotite-rich matrix containing plagioclase and quartz. The pluton is cut by discrete 5-30 m-thick dykes of fine grained and only slightly porphyritic Dumbie Granodiorite (e.g at site SPJPKH000807; Zone 50, MGA 489749E 7237114N), that locally are so fine grained that they appear glassy. Some of these dykes contain stubby, 1-2 mm-wide K-feldspar phenocrysts but only make up a maximum of <5% of the rock. Locally, the Dumbie Granodiorite contains small clusters of fine magnetite crystals. Hydrated allanite is a prominent accessory mineral forming brown prismatic crystals up to 1.5 mm long.   Inclusions of amphibolite, fine-grained granodiorite, and biotite schist are common in the Dumbie Granodiorite on LANDOR. These inclusions commonly contain a folded foliation, whereas the porphyritic biotite monzogranite typically only contains one foliation that is subparallel to the axial surfaces of folds contained within the inclusions.  On the southern part of PINK HILLS, medium- to coarse-grained seriate to porphyritic metagranodiorite shows a range of deformation textures from essentially undeformed through to gneissic in local high strain zones. Rafts and inclusions of the gneissic material are contained within, and the gneissic fabrics cut by, finer grained, weakly foliated granodiorite.

A single intrusion (~18 km&sup2;) on LYNDON intrudes the contact between the Durlacher and Moorarie Supersuites. Some dykes also intrude granites of the Minnie Creek batholith in the Limejuice Zone. The dykes may be related to the leucocratic, medium-grained, muscovite-tourmaline(-biotite) monzogranite (P_-DU-gmvt). This unit has not been dated and is given the same age range age of 1680-1620 Ma as for the supersuite.","Tourmaline-muscovite pegmatite and fine-grained, leucocratic granite (P_-DU-gpt) mostly forms dykes and layered stocks that intrude a large part of the Boora Boora and Mangaroon Zones, and to a minor extent, the Limejuice Zone. The largest stocks form a series of northwesterly-trending, irregular shaped intrusions in the northeastern corner of TOWERA. The largest intrusion on TOWERA forms a pair of associated stocks that cover 22 km 2  between the Mountain Creek and Rouse Creek Faults. To the northeast of Mundong Fault a series of smaller, intensely-folded stocks and dykes are abundant.  On the northern part of LYNDON, the unit forms a single, but faulted intrusion (18 km 2 ), where it intrudes the southern contact between granitic rocks of the Durlacher Supersuite in the Mangaroon Zone and the Minnie Creek batholith in the Limejuice Zone.  The dykes are particularly abundant in the area southeast of Bookathanna Well on central MANGAROON, and in the northeastern corner of TOWERA and northwestern corner of MAROONAH, where they are up to 1 km long and 3 m wide. On MAROONAH many of the dykes strike north to north-northeast, but others, where they intrude metamorphosed sedimentary and granitic rocks, are subparallel to the existing foliation or gneissic layering. Several sheet-like composite bodies of the tourmaline-muscovite pegmatite and leucocratic granite are present around the Laura Prospect on MAROONAH. Northwest of James Bore on MANGAROON composite dykes of pegmatite and leucocratic granite are well developed.

The leucocratic tourmaline-muscovite granite has a similar mineralogy to the tourmaline-bearing phase of the muscovite-biotite granite (P_-DU-gmvt). Both rock types have the same field relationships, and pegmatitic segregations are present within the muscovite-biotite granite. For these reasons, the pegmatite and leucocratic granite are considered to be of the same age as the muscovite-biotite granite.  The large intrusion on LYNDON along the contact between the Mangaroon and Limejuice Zones is composed of multiple pegmatitic and coarse-grained leucocratic dykes with textures and relationships as described above.

The Edmund Subgroup was then elevated to Edmund Group by Martin et al. (1999) and Martin and Thorne (2002) as part of their redefinition of the Bangemall Supergroup.   The current stratigraphic subdivision of the Edmund Group follows that of Martin and Thorne (2002). Under this scheme the Group is divided into eleven formations, consisting of (in stratigraphically ascending order): the Yilgatherra, Irregully, Gooragoora, Blue Billy, Cheyne Springs, Kiangi Creek, Muntharra, Discovery, Devil Creek, Ullawarra, and Coodardoo Formations. Unlike some previous workers (e.g. Muhling and Brakel, 1985; Martin et al., 2008), the Mount Augustus Sandstone is here considered to be an older sedimentary unit that is separate from the Edmund Group.   Martin and Thorne (2004) and Martin et al. (2008) used the term 'depositional package' in order to describe the tectonic evolution of the Edmund and Collier Basins, the depositional settings for the Edmund and Collier Groups. Under this scheme the fourteen lithostratigraphic formations of the Edmund and Collier Groups are arranged into six depositional packages which represent discrete stages in basin development. The lower packages make up the Edmund Group and consist of (in ascending stratigraphic order): Depositional package 1 (Yilgatherra and Irregully Formations), Depositional package 2 (Gooragoora, Blue Billy, and Cheyne Springs Formations), Depositional package 3 (Kiangi Creek and Muntharra Formations), and Depositional package 4 (Discovery, Devil Creek, Ullawarra, and Coodardoo Formations). The remaining two packages, namely Depositional package 5 (Backdoor and Calyie Formations) and Depositional package 6 (Ilgarari Formation) make up the Collier Group.  The Edmund Group is equivalent to the Top Camp Dolomite of Halligan and Daniels (1964). It also equates to the Weegarinna and Florry Subgroups, and part of the Dooley Subgroup of Chuck (1984). The Edmund Group is tentatively correlated with the Scorpion Group and Cornelia and Quadrio Formations in the southeastern Capricorn Orogen (Hocking et al., 2000).  A type area for the former Edmund Subgroup was not defined by Muhling and Brakel (1985). Martin and Thorne (2002) note that the succession is best developed and exposed on the EDMUND 1:250 000 map sheet, particularly along Irregully Creek (Zone 50, MGA 457800E 7397700N) and in the Barley Ranges (Zone 50, MGA 428400E 7378300N).",,"The Edmund Group is a mixed siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary unit made up (in ascending stratigraphic order) of the Yilgatherra, Irregully, Goooragoora, Blue Billy, Cheyne Springs, Kiangi Creek, Muntharra, Discovery, Devil Creek, Ullawarra, and Coodardoo Formations.  The Yilgatherra Formation is a fining-upward sedimentary unit in which lower levels are composed of sandstone and conglomerate, whereas upper levels contain increased amounts of siltstone. Minor dolostone is also present in near the top of the formation.  The principal lithologies in the Irregully Formation are laminated and stromatolitic dolostone, dolarenite, and dolorudite, together with sandstone, dolomitic sandstone, quartz pebble conglomerate, and laminated siltstone. Considerable thicknesses of quartz sandstone and siltstone are also interbedded with the dolostone in areas south of the Talga and Mount Vernon Faults.  The Gooragoorra Formation is composed of fine- to very coarse-grained quartz sandstone, feldspathic sandstone and siltstone, and minor conglomerate. Significant thicknesses of cross-stratified sandstone and minor amounts of dolostone and dolomitic siltstone are also present in upper parts of the stratigraphy.   Rocks belonging to the Blue Billy Formation consist primarily of parallel-planar laminated, black, pyritic, carbonaceous, fissile to flaggy siltstone that weathers to a blue-grey colour. The formation also contains thick-bedded, massive, medium- to coarse-grained quartz sandstone, dolomitic sandstone, and pebbly sandstone and minor dolomitic siltstone, thin-bedded dolostone, and black chert are present in upper parts of the formation.   The Cheyne Springs Formation comprises interbedded dololutite, dolarenite, dolorudite, mudstone, siltstone, and sandstone. Dolostones are most abundant in lower parts of the stratigraphy whereas the proportion of sandstone increases towards the top.  Major rock types in the Kiangi Creek Formation are siltstone, fine- to very coarse-grained sandstone, and dolostone, together with minor conglomerate, and chert. The formation also contains two felsic volcanic units that together make up the Tangadee Rhyolite member. In general, the coarser grained siliciclastic rocks dominate the lower part of the formation whereas siltstone and fine-grained sandstone is most abundant in upper levels. Dolomitic rocks are most abundant on the Pingandy Shelf, north of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system.  The Muntharra Formation consists mainly of dolostone and stromatolitic dolostone, together with sandstone, dolomitic sandstone, and siltstone. The dolostones form thin- to very thick-bedded tabular units and are generally composed of either massive to laminated dololutite, or weakly laminated dolarenite. Stromatolitic dolostones are dominated by very thick bedded  Conophyton  biostromes.  Rocks belonging to the Discovery Formation are composed of massive or laminated chert, together with silicified mudstone and siltstone. Minor occurrences of silicified sandstone and conglomerate are also present in the north western part of the Edmund Basin.  The Devil Creek Formation comprises non-stromatolitic and stromatolitic dolostone, dolostone breccia, dolomitic siltstone and siltstone, and minor diagenetic chert. Thick layers of chert breccia have been mapped in the upper part of the formation on KENNETH RANGE and major occurrences of siltstone are recorded south of the Talga and Mount Vernon Faults in central and eastern parts of the Edmund Basin.  The main lithology in the Ullawarra Formation is siltstone, together with subordinate fine-grained sandstone, dolostone, and chert. Substantial thicknesses of fine- to coarse-grained sandstone are interbedded with the siltstone in areas south of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system and have been mapped as separate members (Curran and Nanular Members) of the formation. In addition, a thick unit of ferruginous and manganiferous siltstone has been mapped on JAMINDI and a localized occurrence of dolostone has been recognized on KENNETH RANGE. Minor occurrences of felsic volcaniclastic rock have also been mapped within the Ullawarra Formation on MILGUN and CALYIE.  The Coodardoo Formation is composed of thin- to very thick-bedded, fine- to very coarse-grained lithic quartz sandstone and pebbly sandstone, interbedded with siltstone. A thin unit of siltstone and sandstone has been mapped in the middle of the formation on ELLIOTT CREEK, ULLAWARRA, and EDMUND.  Despite many of the rocks of the Edmund Group being weak to moderately deformed, they are all essentially unmetamorphosed; however, rare, weakly metamorphosed rocks are locally present. Schistose metasandstones and metasiltstones (P_-MEy-mts) that are located below the Irregully Formation in the Woodlands Dome on MULGUL, have tentatively been assigned to the Yilgatherra Formation, and low- to medium-grade schistose metasedimentary rocks (P_-MEk-mh, P_-MEd-ml, P_-MEv-mk, P_-MEl-mlsd) on PINK HILLS are recognized as being metamorphosed equivalents of the Kiangi Creek, Discovery, Devil Creek, and Ullawarra Formations.","The Edmund Group comprises mixed fluvial to marine shelf or basinal deposits whose character and distribution was strongly controlled by fluctuations in relative sea-level and synsedimentary movement on major faults. During deposition of the Yilgatherra and Irregully Formations (Depositional package 1) the original northeastern basin margin was probably close to the present-day outcrop limit of the Edmund Group on the Pingandy Shelf (Martin and Thorne, 2004). The Yilgatherra Formation comprises fluvial sandstone and conglomerate, overlain by shallow-marine sandstone and deeper marine shelf siltstone. The overlying Irregully Formation records a fluctuating history of relative sea-level change that appears to have been at least partially controlled by subsidence across major basement structures such as the Talga, Mount Vernon, and Lyons River Faults. During this time thin peritidal platform carbonates were deposited on the Pingandy Shelf, whereas thick slope, marine, and fluvial deposits were laid down in areas farther south.   Deposition of the overlying Gooragoora, Blue Billy, and Cheyne Springs Formations (Depositional package 2) occurred in response to a rise in relative sea-level and drowning of the Edmund Basin, including the Pingandy Shelf (Martin and Thorne, 2004). In contrast to Depositional Package 1, major basement structures had little influence on sedimentation at this time. Coarse-grained deltaic and alluvial deposits belonging to the Gooragoora Formation are overlain by deep-marine anoxic mudstone of the Blue Billy Formation. This transition records the maximum extent of the Depositional Package 2 transgression. It was followed by a slight shallowing and decline in siliciclastic input that culminated in deposition of the Cheyne Springs Formation.  The period following Cheyne Springs Formation deposition was marked by uplift and erosion, followed by deposition of the Kiangi Creek and Muntharra Formations (Depositional package 3). Thick alluvial, deltaic, and deep-marine sandstones within the lower Kiangi Creek Formation are associated with large, basin-scale faults and suggest that Kiangi Creek Formation sedimentation began with the infill and burial of a horst-and-graben basin architecture. Two areas of fluvio-deltaic and shallow-marine shelf sedimentation have been identified at this time: northeast of the Talga Fault on the Pingandy Shelf, and in the Coobarra Dome - Jillawarra Sub-basin area south of the Bujundunna and Quartzite Well Faults. In the latter area, the stratigraphy reflects the interplay between a coarse-grained, alluvial-fan system near the Bujundunna Fault and a rapidly subsiding, fault-bounded, deep-marine depocentre to the west. Upper levels of the Kiangi Creek Formation record a regional flooding and widespread fine-grained deep-marine sedimentation. The overlying Muntharra Formation was deposited in response to a shallowing and waning of siliciclastic input along the Pingandy Shelf. During this time high-energy carbonate grainstone of the Muntharra Formation was deposited along the line of the Talga Fault whereas sulfidic mudstone accumulated in deeper water towards the southwest (Martin and Thorne, 2004).  Upper units of the Edmund Group (Depositional package 4) were deposited following a major marine transgression that crossed the region from southwest to northeast (Martin and Thorne, 2004). Localized thin, coarse-grained deposits at the base of the Discovery Formation are overlain by deep-marine sulfidic mudstone and chert. During this time there appears to have been no significant movement along the major basinal structures. A more significant reactivation of the Talga, Mount Vernon, Quartzite Well, and Lyons River Faults took place during deposition of the overlying Devil Creek and Ullawarra Formations. This event was accompanied by a change to a southeasterly sediment source, with additional contribution from the northwest during deposition of the Coodardoo Formation.",,9500,,"The Edmund Group unconformably overlies Paleoproterozoic rocks of the Capricorn Orogen. These include the Mount Augustus Sandstone, the Wyloo, Bresnahan, Capricorn, Mount Minnie, and Padbury Groups and igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Gascoyne Province. The nature of the lower contact with the Mount Augustus Sandstone is unclear as it is generally either faulted or not exposed. The Edmund Group is unconformably overlain by the Collier Group.",,17,,,Mixed,2,,,,1673,,1455,,"The age of the Edmund Group is poorly constrained, but it was probably deposited between c. 1673 and 1455 Ma based on the maximum age of the Yilgatherra Formation given by the youngest group of detrital zircons in sandstone units on UAROO and from the age of felsic volcaniclastic rocks within the Ullawarra Formation, near the top of the Edmund Group.  The older age limit for the Edmund Group had previously been provided by the c. 1679 Ma maximum depositional age of the underlying Mount Augustus Sandstone (Martin et al., 2008). However, the youngest detrital zircons recovered from the Yilgatherra Formation on UAROO reveal maximum depositional ages of 1675 Â± 13 Ma (GSWA 210009; Zone 50, MGA 327019E 7478902N; Wingate, 2018, written communication), 1673 Â± 13 Ma (GSWA 210006; Zone 50, MGA 325958E 7486391N; Wingate, 2018, written communication), and a conservative maximum depositional age of 1684 Â± 4 Ma (GSWA 210011; Zone 50, MGA 307330E 7481194N). Considering other relative dating relationships, the Irregully Formation toward the base of the Edmund Group, unconformably overlies granitic rocks of the 1680-1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite in the Gascoyne Province (Sheppard et al., 2010). The Discretion Granite on MARQUIS is the youngest granitic rock in the Durlacher Supersuite and has been dated at 1619 Â± 15 Ma (GSWA 142855, Nelson, 1998; Sheppard et al., 2010). However, the boundary between the Discretion Granite and the overlying lower Edmund Group is faulted and the true nature of the contact, whether it is intrusive or unconformable, cannot be determined.  The minimum age of c. 1455 Ma for the Edmund Group is derived from the ages of felsic volcaniclastic rocks within the Ullawarra Formation, and also from the age of the Narimbunna Dolerite which intrudes the Edmund Group stratigraphy. Wingate et al. (GSWA 149031, 2010a) and Wingate et al. (GSWA 143440, 2012a) obtained maximum depositional ages of 1463 Â± 8 Ma and 1455 Â± 9 Ma from felsic volcaniclastic units within the Ullawarra Formation on MILGUN and CALYIE respectively, which are interpreted as being close to depositional ages. In addition, Wingate (GSWA 148994, 2010b) acquired an age 1461 Â± 7 Ma from the youngest group of detrital zircons in a sandstone sample, taken from the Ullawarra Formation on PEEDAWARRA. The ages obtained from the Ullawarra Formation are within uncertainty of the c. 1465 Ma age of the Narimbunna Dolerite (Wingate, 2002; Martin et al., 2005) and indicate that dolerite intrusion, felsic volcanism, and Ullawarra Formation sedimentation were essentially coeval (GSWA 149031, Wingate et al., 2010a).  The minimum age for the lower Edmund Group (Yilgatherra to Gooragoora Formations) is given by age of the earliest phase of mineralization in the Irregully and Gooragoora Formation host rocks at the Abra polymetallic deposit. This event has been dated to between 1610 Â± 16 Ma and 1590 Â± 9 Ma, based on the U-Pb age of hydrothermal xenotime within the deposit (Zi et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2015). The c. 1590 Ma mineralization also provides a maximum age for the Kiangi Creek Formation in the middle part of the Edmund Group. Sills belonging to the Waldburg Dolerite are intruded into the Kiangi Creek Formation and lower parts of the Edmund Group on MOUNT AUGUSTUS, MANGAROON, and CANDOLLE. These sills have igneous crystallization ages of 1517-1505 Ma (GSWA 206916, Wingate, 2015; GSWA 143445, Wingate et al., 2012b) and provide a younger age limit for the Blue Billy, Cheyne Springs, and Kiangi Creek Formations.

The lower part of the stratigraphy (Yilgatherra Formation) is a fining-upwards succession of mainly fluvial sandstone and conglomerate, overlain by shallow-marine sandstone and deeper marine shelf siltstone. Middle to upper parts (Irregully Formation) record an initial deepening, then shallowing, of the Edmund Basin. During this time carbonate and siliciclastic sedimentation was strongly influenced by active growth faulting along major basement structures. The package has a maximum thickness of about 4000 m and forms extensive outcrops along the exposed margin of the Edmund Basin. It is also present in a number of structural inliers in the central part of the basin. Depositional package 1 unconformably overlies Paleoproterozoic basement rocks of the Capricorn Orogen. The upper contact of the package with Depositional package 2 is a conformable marine flooding surface. In areas where Depositional package 2 is absent, Depositional package 1 is disconformably overlain by Depositional package 3. Depositional package 1 is a mixed carbonate and siliciclastic unit. Depositional package 1 was probably deposited between c. 1673 and 1610 Ma. "," Depositional package 1 forms extensive outcrops along the exposed margin of the Edmund Basin on the YANREY, EDMUND, TUREE CREEK, MOUNT PHILLIPS, ROBINSON RANGE, MOUNT EGERTON, and COLLIER 1:250 000 map sheets. The package also outcrops in a number of structural inliers, such as the Glen Ross and Muddaberri Anticlines in the central part of the Edmund Basin. The lower siliciclastic unit (Yilgatherra Formation) is thin and discontinuous in the Pingandy Shelf area, northeast of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system on the EDMUND and TUREE CREEK 1:250 000 map sheets. Elsewhere the Yilgatherra formation is more continuous and it may form extensive outcrops, particularly on PINK HILLS and CANDOLLE. The Irregully Formation makes up the middle to upper part of Depositional package 1 and is present throughout most of the mapped area. However, the formation is locally absent from southeastern EDMUND, southwestern ELLIOTT CREEK, and eastern CALYIE due to erosion following deposition of the Irregully Formation, but preceeding deposition of the Kiangi Creek Formation. The greatest development of Depositional package 1 is on PEEDAWARRA and CANDOLLE, where the succession has a maximum thickness of about 4000 m. "," Martin and Thorne (2004) and Martin et al. (2008) used the term 'depositional package' in order to describe the tectonic evolution of the Edmund and Collier Basins. Under this scheme the 14 lithostratigraphic formations of the Bangemall Supergroup are arranged into 6 depositional packages, which represent discrete stages in basin development. The lower packages make up the Edmund Group and consist of (in stratigraphically ascending order): Depositional package 1 (Yilgatherra and Irregully Formations), Depositional package 2 (Gooragoora, Blue Billy, and Cheyne Springs Formations), Depositional package 3 (Kiangi Creek and Muntharra Formations), and Depositional package 4 (Discovery, Devil Creek, Ullawarra, and Coodardoo Formations). The remaining two packages, namely Depositional package 5 (Backdoor and Calyie Formations) and Depositional package 6 (Ilgarari Formation) form the Collier Group.   Each depositional package consists of an assemblage of genetically related strata, with a basal contact that is either a regional unconformity or a major flooding surface (Martin and Thorne, 2004). As such, the depositional packages do not correspond exactly with either unconformity-bounded sequences (ISSC, 1987) or the sequence stratigraphic units of Vail et al. (1977). In the case of the former, a subdivision based on the presence of basal unconformities would be too broad, whereas subivision based on the latter suggests a basin evolution related to cyclic changes of global sea level, and by implication, an order of duration for each unit. At present, the stratigraphic and geochronological framework for the Bangemall Supergroup is based on regional lithological mapping and is not sufficiently detailed to attempt a rigorous sequence stratigraphic analysis. South of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system, such an analysis is further hindered by the predominance of fine-grained lithofacies deposited below storm wave base, the volume of dolerite intrusions, and the degree of deformation. However, the depositional packages are broadly similar in style and approximate duration to the supersequences of Vail et al. (1977) and other workers. Each package records an upward-shallowing basin filling event, and commonly reflects a significant change in paleogeography (Martin and Thorne, 2004). ",," Depositional package 1 is a mixed carbonate and siliciclastic unit comprising the basal Yilgatherra Formation and the overlying Irregully Formation. Lower parts of the Yilgatherra Formation are composed of sandstone and conglomerate, whereas upper levels contain increased amounts of siltstone. Low-grade schistose metasandstones and metasiltstones (P_-MEy-mts) that are situated below the Irregully Formation in the Woodlands Dome on MULGUL have tentatively been assigned to the Yilgatherra Formation. The Irregully Formation is composed of laminated and stromatolitic dolostone, dolarenite, and dolorudite, together with sandstone, dolomitic sandstone, quartz pebble conglomerate, and laminated siltstone. Significant thicknesses of quartz sandstone and siltstone are interbedded with the dolostone in areas south of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system and have been mapped as separate members within the Irregully Formation. "," The lower part of Depositional package 1 (Yilgatherra Formation) is a fining-upwards succession of mainly fluvial sandstone and conglomerate, overlain by shallow-marine sandstone and deeper marine shelf siltstone (Martin and Thorne, 2004). These deposits are discontinuous and confined to topographic lows on the Pingandy Shelf, north of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system, but are more sheet-like in areas to the south.   Further deepening of the Edmund Basin took place during deposition of the lower Irregully Formation and appears to have been controlled largely by subsidence across the major basement structures, particularly the Talga Fault (Martin and Thorne, 2004). On the Pingandy Shelf, interbedded peritidal and supratidal facies at the base of the formation are overlain by peritidal facies that record an initial upward-deepening and drowning. The presence of upward-shoaling cycles in the lower part of this succession suggests that this transgression was stepped, and possibly related to episodic fault movement. Middle and upper parts of the Irregully Formation in this area consist of slope lithofacies and stromatolitic bioherms that record shallowing of the carbonate platform to wave base.   The relatively thin succession of peritidal platform facies that characterizes the Irregully Formation on the Pingandy Shelf contrasts markedly with the thick slope, marine, and fluvial facies deposits that are present south of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system (Martin and Thorne, 2004). Immediately south of this structure, the lower Irregully Formation is dominated by slope-facies breccias and planar-laminated dolomudstone and siltstone, with localized shallow-marine and fluvial sandstone. In contrast, the mid to upper Irregully Formation in this area is represented by shallow-marine sandstone and stromatolitic dolostone. Between the Lyons River Fault and the faulted southwestern margin of the Wanna Syncline, the middle to upper parts of the Irregully Formation are characterized by a marked thickening, totalling hundreds of metres. This increase was accompanied by the deposition of significant amounts of fluvial to marine siliciclastic facies (Martin et al., 2005). Paleocurrent data indicate that the subsidence that took place between these structures was accompanied by a gentle tilting to the southwest and southeast. Differential movement along the basement faults appears to have stopped by the time the upper part of the Irregully Formation was deposited. This allowed stromatolitic shallow-marine shelf carbonate facies to blanket much of the area both to the north and south of the Talga Fault. The extreme thickness variation shown by the Irregully Formation suggests that much of the Pingandy Shelf succession was subaerially exposed and eroded during periods of fluvial and shallow-marine sedimentation south of the Talga and Mount Vernon Faults. Support for this interpretation comes from the presence of a karst surface at the top of the Irregully Formation, below the Blue Billy Formation at the base of Package 2 (Chuck, 1984). ",,4000,," Depositional package 1 unconformably overlies Palaeoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Ashburton Formation, Capricorn and Padbury Groups, and Mount Augustus Sandstone, and Paleoproterozoic igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Gascoyne Province. The nature of the lower contact with the Mount Augustus Sandstone is unclear as it is generally either faulted or not exposed. The upper contact of the package is a conformable marine flooding surface and is overlain by either the Gooragoora Formation or the Blue Billy Formation belonging to Depositional package 2. Where these formations are absent the package has a disconformable contact with the Kiangi Creek Formation (Depositional package 3). ",,8,,,,3,,,,1673,,1610,," The age of Depositional package 1 is poorly known. It was probably deposited between c. 1673 and 1610 Ma based on the maximum age of the Yilgatherra Formation given by the youngest group of detrital zircons in sandstone units on UAROO and the age of mineralization in the overlying Irregully and Gooragoora Formations.  The older age limit for Depositional Package 1 had previously been provided by the c. 1679 Ma maximum depositional age of the underlying Mount Augustus Sandstone (Martin et al., 2008). However, the youngest detrital zircons recovered from the Yilgatherra Formation on UAROO reveal maximum depositional ages of 1675 Â± 13 Ma (GSWA 210009; Zone 50, MGA 327019E 7478902N; Wingate, 2018, written communication), 1673 Â± 13 Ma (GSWA 210006; Zone 50, MGA 325958E 7486391N; Wingate, 2018, written communication), and a conservative maximum depositional age of 1684 Â± 4 Ma (GSWA 210011; Zone 50, MGA 307330E 7481194N). Considering other relative dating relationships, Depositional package 1 overlies granitic rocks of the 1680-1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite in the Gascoyne Province (Sheppard et al., 2010). The Discretion Granite on MARQUIS is the youngest granitic rock in the Durlacher Supersuite and has been dated at 1619 Â± 15 Ma (GSWA 142855, Nelson, 1998; Sheppard et al., 2010). However, the boundary between the Discretion Granite and Depositional package 1 is faulted and the true nature of the contact, whether it is intrusive or unconformable, cannot be determined.  The minimum age for Depositional package 1 is given by the U-Pb age of hydrothermal xenotime of 1610 Â± 16 Ma for the earliest phase of mineralization in the Irregully and Gooragoora Formation host rocks at the Abra polymetallic deposit (Zi et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2015). Mineralization and hydrothermal fluid flow, in the same part of the stratigraphy, continued until at least 1590 Â± 9 Ma (Zi et al., 2015). Both periods of mineralization pre-date the Waldburg Dolerite that intrudes Depositional package 1 and overlying parts of the Edmund Group. Wingate et al. (2015a) determined an age of 1517 Â± 8 Ma from a sill of Waldburg Dolerite, intruded into the overlying Kiangi Creek Formation on southeastern MOUNT AUGUSTUS. Another sill, intruded along the disconformable contact between the Irregully and Kiangi Creek Formations on MOUNT AUGUSTUS, yielded an age of 1513 Â± 5 Ma (Wingate et al., 2015b). Wingate et al. (2012) also obtained an age of 1505 Â± 3 Ma from a sample of Waldburg Dolerite that intrudes the Irregully Formation near Waldburg Homestead (Zone 50, MGA 536400E 7263600N) on central CANDOLLE. Sills of the Narimbunna Dolerite, which intrude Depositional package 1 and overlying units of the Edmund Group, are younger than the Waldburg Dolerite and have been dated at c. 1465 Ma by Wingate (2002).

Each package records an upward-shallowing basin filling event, and commonly reflects a significant change in paleogeography (Martin and Thorne, 2004).",,"Depositional package 2 is a mixed siliclastic and carbonate sedimentary unit made up (in stratigraphically ascending order) of the Gooragoora, Blue Billy, and Cheyne Springs Formations. The Gooragoorra Formation is composed of fine- to very coarse-grained quartz sandstone, feldspathic sandstone and siltstone, together with minor conglomerate. Significant thicknesses of cross-stratified sandstone and minor amounts of dolostone and dolomitic siltstone are also present in upper parts of the unit. In contrast, the overlying Blue Billy Formation consists primarily of a distinctive parallel-planar laminated, black, pyritic, carbonaceous, fissile to flaggy siltstone that weathers to a blue-grey colour. The Blue Billy Formation also contains thick-bedded, massive, medium- to coarse-grained quartz sandstone, dolomitic sandstone, and pebbly sandstone; minor dolomitic siltstone, thin-bedded dolostone, and black chert are present in upper parts of the formation. The Cheyne Springs Formation comprises interbedded dololutite, dolarenite, dolorudite, mudstone, siltstone, and sandstone. Dolostones are most abundant in lower parts of the stratigraphy whereas the proportion of sandstone increases towards the top.","The evolution of the Edmund Basin during Depositional package 2 sedimentation has been summarized by Martin and Thorne (2004) who note that although the contact between Depositional package 2, and the underlying Depositional package 1 is sharp, it does not show evidence of significant erosion. These workers argue that sedimentation in Depositional package 2 took place in response to a rise in relative sea level and drowning of the Edmund Basin, including the Pingandy Shelf. This event resulted in deposition of planar-laminated siltstone at the base of the Gooragoora Formation throughout the study area. The cause of this rise in sea level, whether it was tectonically or eustatically controlled, is unknown. In contrast to Depositional package 1, thickness, facies, and paleocurrent trends in Depositional package 2 suggest that basement structures such as the Talga and Mount Vernon Faults had little influence on sedimentation at this time. Coarse-grained deltaic sedimentation in the Gooragoora Formation was restricted to the northwestern part of the study area. Here, the progradation of deltaic sandstones during a period of high or rising sea level suggests that uplift to the northwest exceeded the rate of sea-level rise (Martin and Thorne, 2004). To this effect, the southeasterly thinning of the Gooragoora Formation probably reflects the extent of delta progradation rather than any subsequent erosion. The deposition of deep-marine anoxic mudstone of the overlying Blue Billy Formation records the maximum extent of the Depositional package 2 transgression and expansion of the depocentre beyond the preserved limits of the Edmund Basin. Localised turbidite and mass-flow deposits, which are present in the upper part of the Blue Billy Formation in the northwest, were deposited both north and south of the Talga Fault. The gradational contact between the Blue Billy Formation and distal shelf facies of the overlying Cheyne Springs Formation marks a slight shallowing of the Edmund Basin. The fact that shallow-marine facies are most abundant in southeastern parts of the Pingandy Shelf suggests that there may have been a gentle east to west paleoslope during the latter stages of Depositional package 2 sedimentation (Martin and Thorne, 2004).",,1250,,Depositional package 2 is separated from the underlying Depositional package 1 (Yilgatherra and Irregully Formations) by a conformable marine flooding surface. Its contact with the overlying Depositional package 3 (Kiangi Creek and Muntharra Formations) is a disconformity.,,8,,,,3,,,,1673,,1517,,"The age of the Depositional package 2 is poorly known, but was probably deposited between c. 1673 and 1517 Ma, an age range based on geochronology data from underlying and overlying units within the Capricorn Orogen. Ages given by the youngest groups of detrital zircons in sandstone units occurring within the package (Gooragoora and Blue Billy Formations) are maximum values only, and are at least 60 Ma older than the likely older age limit for the package.  The maximum age of Depositional package 2 is constrained by its stratigraphic position, in which it directly overlies the Irregully Formation in Depositional package 1. The older age limit for Depositional Package 1 is provided by the c. 1673 Ma maximum age of the underlying Yilgatherra Formation (P_-MEy-st). Depositional package 1 overlies granitic rocks of the 1680-1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite in the Gascoyne Province (Sheppard et al., 2010). The Discretion Granite on MARQUIS is the youngest granite in the Durlacher Supersuite and has been dated at 1619 Â± 15 Ma (GSWA 142855, Nelson, 1998; Sheppard et al., 2010). However, the boundary between the Discretion Granite and Depositional package 1 is faulted and the true nature of the contact, whether it is intrusive or unconformable, cannot be determined.  The minimum age for the Gooragoora Formation at the base of Depositional package 2 is given by the age of the earliest phase of mineralization in the Irregully and Gooragoora Formation host rocks at the Abra polymetallic deposit. This event has been dated at 1610 Â± 16 Ma, based on the U-Pb age of hydrothermal xenotime within the deposit (Zi et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2015). Mineralization and hydrothermal fluid flow, in the same part of the stratigraphy, continued until at least 1590 Â± 9 Ma (Zi et al. 2015). However, the relationship of these mineralization events to the rest of Depositional package 2 is unknown and the mineralization could have taken place either before or after deposition of the Blue Billy and Cheyne Springs Formations. For this reason the minimum age for Depositional package 2 is given by the c. 1517 Ma date of the Waldburg Dolerite that intrudes into underlying and overlying parts of the Edmund Group. Wingate et al. (GSWA 206916, 2015a) determined an age of 1517 Â± 8 Ma from a sill of Waldburg Dolerite that intruded into the Kiangi Creek Formation on southeastern MOUNT AUGUSTUS. Another sill that intruded along the disconformable contact between the Irregully and Kiangi Creek Formations on MOUNT AUGUSTUS yielded an age of 1513 Â± 5 Ma (GSWA 206991, Wingate et al., 2015b). Sills of the Narimbunna Dolerite, which intrude overlying units of the Edmund Group are younger than the Waldburg Dolerite and have been dated at c. 1465 Ma by Wingate (2002).

1319,,P_-MEP3-sk,89,"Edmund Group, Depositional package 3",1,"Siltstone and mudstone; sandstone, and dolostone, minor conglomerate","The name 'Depositional package 3' is used to facilitate the description of the tectonic evolution of the Edmund Basin during deposition of the Kiangi Creek and Muntharra Formations. The package has a maximum thickness of about 2600 m and has been recorded from most of the Edmund Basin. Depositional package 3 is separated from the underlying Depositional package 2 and the overlying Depositional package 4 by disconformity surfaces. The major part of Depositional package 3 is made up of the Kiangi Creek Formation, which is composed of siltstone, sandstone, and dolostone, together with minor conglomerate, chert, and felsic volcanic rock. These deposits are associated with large, basin-scale faults and suggest that Kiangi Creek Formation sedimentation began with the infill and burial of a horst-and-graben basin architecture. Two major areas of fluvio-deltaic and shallow-marine shelf sedimentation have been identified for the lower Kiangi Creek Formation. These are located northeast of the Talga Fault on the Pingandy Shelf and in the Coobarra Dome - Jillawarra Sub-basin area, south of the Bujundunna and Quartzite Well Faults. Fine-grained siliciclastic, ferruginous, and dolomitic rocks in the upper Kiangi Creek Formation record a period of decreased siliciclastic supply and expansion of the marine basin to the north and east. Upper levels of Depositional package 3 (Muntharra Formation) are mostly composed of dolostone and sandstone and were deposited in response to a shallowing of the Edmund Basin along the Pingandy Shelf. Depositional package 3 was probably deposited between c. 1590 and 1465 Ma.","Depositional package 3 forms extensive outcrops along the exposed margin of the Edmund Basin on the YANREY, EDMUND, TUREE CREEK, MOUNT PHILLIPS, ROBINSON RANGE, MOUNT EGERTON, and COLLIER 1:250 000 map sheets. It also outcrops in numerous structural inliers, such as the Glen Ross, Range Creek, Mulgul, and Muddaberri Anticlines, in the central part of the Basin.  The package ranges in thickness from about 400-1100 m on the Pingandy Shelf, north of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system. Southwest of these faults, on MAROONAH, MANGAROON, and EDMUND the package varies in thickness from 200 m to about 650 m. This succession thickens markedly when traced to the southeast on MOUNT AUGUSTUS. It is about 800 m thick in the eastern Cobra Syncline and around 1400 m thick in the nearby Geegin Syncline. The eastward thickening trend is maintained on to PEEDAWARRA and MOUNT EGERTON, where 1500 m, 2600 m, and 1550 m of Depositional package 3 rocks are recorded from the Beerala, Allarons, and Genoa Synclines, respectively. The succession is slightly thinner (~1100 m) in the Range Creek Syncline and Mulgul Anticline on MULGUL, but thickens to 2000-2600 m in the area around the Bujundunna Fault and Calyie Syncline on CALYIE. Depositional package 3 is generally poorly exposed on the ROBINSON RANGE 1:250 000 map sheet. It is estimated to be about 500 m thick on ERRABIDDY and MILGUN, thickening to around 1300 m near the Mount Clere Fault on MARQUIS.   In the northwest, on UAROO, the package is as much as 2100 m thick. Medium- to coarse-grained silicified sandstone members (P_-MEk-st and P_-MEk-sf) are well exposed on both limbs of the Uaroo Syncline with steep to vertical beds forming prominent ridges separated by valleys of poorly exposed siltstone (P_-MEk-sl). Folded and faulted P_-MEk-sf member is exposed on the limbs of the Ulid Anticline and Weston Syncline. Limited exposure of thin-bedded dolomite P_-MEk-kd is located at base of the formation, at the northern end of the Uaroo Syncline and conglomeratic member P_-MEk-sp is exposed on the western limb of the Uaroo Syncline.","Martin and Thorne (2004) and Martin et al. (2008) used the term 'depositional package' in order to describe the tectonic evolution of the Edmund and Collier Basins. Under this scheme the 14 lithostratigraphic formations of the Bangemall Supergroup are arranged into six depositional packages, which represent discrete stages in basin development. The lower packages make up the Edmund Group and consist of (in ascending stratigraphic order): Depositional package 1 (Yilgatherra and Irregully Formations), Depositional package 2 (Gooragoora, Blue Billy, and Cheyne Springs Formations), Depositional package 3 (Kiangi Creek and Muntharra Formations), and Depositional package 4 (Discovery, Devil Creek, Ullawarra, and Coodardoo Formations). The remaining two packages, namely Depositional package 5 (Backdoor and Calyie Formations) and Depositional package 6 (Ilgarari Formation) make up the Collier Group.  Each depositional package consists of an assemblage of genetically related strata, with a basal contact that is either a regional unconformity or a major flooding surface (Martin and Thorne, 2004). As such the depositional packages do not correspond exactly with either unconformity-bounded sequences (ISSC, 1987) or the sequence stratigraphic units of Vail et al. (1977). In the case of the former, a subdivision based on the presence of basal unconformities would be too broad, whereas a terminology based on the latter suggests a basin evolution related to cyclic changes of global sea level, and by implication, an order of duration for each unit. At present, the stratigraphic and geochronological framework for the Bangemall Supergroup is based on regional lithological mapping, and is not sufficiently detailed to attempt a rigorous sequence stratigraphic analysis. Such an analysis is further hindered by the predominance, south of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system, of fine-grained lithofacies deposited below storm wave-base, the volume of dolerite intrusions, and the degree of deformation. However, the depositional packages are broadly similar in style and approximate duration to the supersequences of Vail et al. (1977) and other workers. Each package records a shallowing-upward basin filling event, and commonly reflects a significant change in paleogeography (Martin and Thorne, 2004).",,"Depositional package 3 is a mixed siliclastic and carbonate sedimentary unit made up of the Kiangi Creek Formation (P_-MEk-sk) and the overlying Muntharra Formation (P_-MEm-kd).   The main rock types in the Kiangi Creek Formation are siltstone, fine to very coarse-grained sandstone, and dolostone, together with minor conglomerate, chert and felsic volcanic rock. The formation is subdivided into nine informal members. These include members dominated by siltstone (P_-MEk-sl, P_-MEk-sli, P_MEk-sf), sandstone (P_-MEk-st, P_-MEk-stq, P_-MEk-ss), dolostone (P_-MEk-kd), conglomerate (P_-MEk-sc), and chert (P_-MEk-cl). The formation also contains two felsic volcanic units (P_-MEkt-fn, P_-MEkt-fr) that together make up the Tangadee Rhyolite member. The major siltstone-dominated member (P_-MEk-sl) comprises siltstone, interbedded with minor sandstone, dolomitic siltstone, dolostone, and chert. Strongly ferruginous and manganiferous siltstones are mapped as a separate unit (P_MEk-sli) on MILGUN and MULGUL. Siltstone units that contain a higher proportion of thinly to very thickly bedded sandstone are abundant and have also been recognized as a separate member (P_-MEk-sf). The sandstone members (P_-MEk-st, P_-MEk-stq, P_-MEk-ss) consist of thinly to very thickly bedded, often dolomitic sandstone, interbedded with subordinate amounts of siltstone, pebbly sandstone, conglomerate, and dolostone. The sandstones are fine- to very coarse-grained and are either massive, or else display a wide variety of small- to very large-scale stratification styles. Dolomitic rocks (P_-MEk-kd) are most abundant on the Pingandy Shelf, north of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system. They consist of stromatolitic and non-stromatolitic dolostone, dolomitic siltstone, siltstone, and sandstone. Stromatolitic dolostones exhibit a wide range of stromatolite morphologies, ranging from very large-scale domical and conical ( Conophyton ) forms through to examples with a small-scale digitate morphology. Conglomerate (P_-MEk-sc) and chert (P_-MEk-cl) are relatively uncommon. The conglomeratic units show a mixture of clast- and matrix-support and consist mostly of well-rounded pebbles, cobbles, and boulders of quartz, jaspilite and sandstone, set in a coarse-grained sandstone matrix. In contrast the chert member is composed of pyritic dark-grey to black chert, interbedded with siltstone. The Tangadee Rhyolite is represented by small bodies of laminated, coherent rhyolite (P_-MEkt-fr) and felsic, lapilli-bearing volcaniclastic sandstone and siltstone (P_-MEk-fn). Low-grade, schistose metasiltstone and metasandstone (P_-MEk-mh) that outcrops around the Big Ben Syncline on PINK HILLS is interpreted as a metamorphosed equivalent of the Kiangi Creek Formation.  The Muntharra Formation consists mainly of dolostone and stromatolitic dolostone, together with sandstone, dolomitic sandstone, and siltstone. The dolostones form thinly to very thickly bedded tabular units and are generally composed of either massive to laminated dololutite or weakly laminated dolarenite. Stromatolitic dolostones are dominated by very thickly bedded  Conophyton  biostromes.","The period following deposition of the Cheyne Springs Formation (the uppermost part of Depositional package 2) was marked by uplift and erosion, followed by deposition of the Kiangi Creek Formation. Thick alluvial, deltaic, and deep-marine sandstones within the lower Kiangi Creek Formation are associated with large, basin-scale faults and suggest that Kiangi Creek Formation sedimentation began with the infill and burial of a horst-and-graben basin architecture.   Two areas of fluvio-deltaic and shallow-marine shelf sedimentation have been identified: northeast of the Talga Fault on the Pingandy Shelf and in the Coobarra Dome - Jillawarra Sub-basin area, south of the Budjindunna and Quartzite Well Faults. On the southeastern Pingandy Shelf the Kiangi Creek Formation is thin and comprises deltaic sandstone and siltstone, derived from the northeast, and local stromatolitic carbonate. Disconformable contacts separate several of the major lithostratigraphic units. When traced to the northwest and also to the southwest of the Talga Mount - Vernon Fault system, the deltaic facies are transitional into deeper marine-shelf siltstone and sandstone.  Kiangi Creek Formation sedimentation in the Coobarra Dome - Jillawarra Sub-basin area reflects the interplay between a coarse-grained alluvial fan system near the Bujundunna Fault and a rapidly subsiding, fault-bounded marine depocentre to the west. In the Coobarra Dome, proximal alluvial fan sandstone and conglomerate were deposited on granitic rocks of the Moorarie Supersuite (Gascoyne Province). Here, the most easterly outcrops record southeasterly directed paleocurrents, whereas outcrops farther west indicate a mostly southwest, then westerly paleoflow that extended as far as MOUNT EGERTON. Small bodies of rhyolite lava and thin felsic volcaniclastic units (Tangadee Rhyolite) are interbedded with alluvial-fan facies on western CALYIE.   On eastern MILGUN and northwestern CALYIE the Kiangi Creek Formation disconformably overlies the Irregully Formation and a locally preserved pocket of Gooragoora Formation that together host the Abra polymetallic deposit (Thorne et al., 2009; Zi et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2015). Here the lower part of the Kiangi Creek Formation comprises up to 1.3 km of fan-delta and deep-marine shelf deposits comprising siltstone interbedded with massive to normally graded, or locally cross-stratified, fine- to very coarse grained sandstone and minor conglomerate (P_-MEk-ss, P_-MEk-sf). These siliciclastic deposits and local interbedded dolostone units, generally show little evidence of reworking by wave or coastal processes other than in the uppermost quartz sandstone (P_-MEk-stq). Fine-grained siliciclastic (P_MEk-sl), ferruginous (P_-MEk-sli), and dolomitic rocks in the upper Kiangi Creek Formation record a waning of siliciclastic input and expansion of the marine basin to the north and east.  The upper levels of Depositional package 3 were deposited in response to a shallowing of the Edmund Basin along the Pingandy Shelf, which was accompanied by a marked decrease in siliciclastic supply to the basin. During this time high-energy carbonate grainstone of the Muntharra Formation was deposited along the line of the Talga Fault, whereas sulfidic mudstone accumulated in deeper water towards the southwest (Martin and Thorne, 2004).",,2600,,"The basal contact of Depositional package 3 is a very low angle disconformity. Where a complete stratigraphy of the lower Edmund Group is exposed, such as on the Pingandy Shelf, the basal contact overlies the uppermost carbonate beds of Depositional package 2 (Cheyne Springs Formation). To the west and southwest, on parts of MAROONAH, MANGAROON, and EDMUND it succeeds the middle part of Depositional package 2 (Blue Billy Formation). Depositional Package 3 directly overlies Depositional package 1 (Irregully Formation) on southeastern EDMUND and in most remaining parts of the Edmund Basin. Exceptions to this occur in the Coobarra Dome on CALYIE, where the Kiangi Creek Formation unconformably overlies basement rocks of the Moorarie Supersuite (Gascoyne Province), and at the Abra polymetallic deposit on CALYIE where it disconformably overlies a thin, eroded remnant of Gooragoora Formation.  Depositional package 3 has a disconformable upper contact with the Discovery Formation throughout the Edmund Basin.",,8,,,,3,,,,1590,,1465,,"The age of Depositional package 3 is poorly known, but it was probably deposited between c. 1590 and 1465 Ma, an age range based on geochronological data from underlying and overlying units within the Capricorn Orogen. At present there is no clear consensus as to the age of the felsic igneous units within the package (Tangadee Rhyolite), whereas ages given by the youngest groups of detrital zircons in sandstone units present within the package are maximum values only and are at least 90 Ma older than the likely older age limit for package.  The maximum age of Depositional package 3 is constrained by its stratigraphic position, in which it disconformably overlies mineralization in the Irregully and Gooragoora Formations (Depositional packages 1 and 2, respectively) at the Abra polymetallic deposit on CALYIE. Here, mineralization pre-dates deposition of the Kiangi Creek Formation at the base of Depositional package 3. Mineralization is constrained to between 1610 Â± 16 Ma and 1590 Â± 9 Ma based on the U-Pb age of hydrothermal xenotime from the deposit (Zi et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2015).   The minimum age of c. 1465 Ma for the Muntharra Formation is derived from the maximum age of the Narimbunna Dolerite, sills of which intrude overlying units of the Edmund Group (Wingate, 2002; Martin et al., 2005). Sills belonging to the Waldburg Dolerite are intruded into the lower part of Depositional package 3 (Kiangi Creek Formation) and underlying parts of the Edmund Group on MOUNT AUGUSTUS, MANGAROON, and CANDOLLE. These sills have igneous crystallization ages of 1517-1505 Ma (GSWA 206916, Wingate 2015; GSWA 143445, Wingate et al., 2012) and provide a younger age limit for the lower part of Depositional package 1.

The Discovery Formation is composed of massive or laminated chert, together with silicified mudstone and siltstone. Minor occurrences of silicified sandstone and conglomerate are also present in the northwestern part of the Edmund Basin (Martin et. al, 2005). The formation is often pyritic, and rhombohedral pseudomorphs after former gypsum have been recorded towards the upper and lower contacts of the unit in many areas (Marshall, 1968). On UAROO, the Discovery Formation outcrops as near vertical beds. Lithology ranges from boudinaged black chert to parallel planar laminated, thin-bedded silicified siltstone, and locally heavily quartz veined silicified fine-grained sandstone.   The Devil Creek Formation comprises non-stromatolitic and stromatolitic dolostone, dolostone breccia, dolomitic siltstone and siltstone, and minor diagenetic chert. Significant thicknesses of chert breccia have been mapped in the upper part of the formation on KENNETH RANGE and major occurrences of siltstone are recorded south of theTalga and Mount Vernon Faults in central and eastern parts of the Edmund Basin. On UAROO, the Devil Creek Formation is restricted to very limited exposures of siltstone in the core of the Uaroo Syncline.  The principal lithologies in the Ullawarra Formation are siltstone, together with subordinate fine-grained sandstone, dolostone, and chert. Greater thicknesses of fine- to coarse-grained sandstone are interbedded with the siltstone in areas south of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system and have been mapped as separate members (e.g. Curran and Nanular Members) of the Ullawarra Formation. In addition, a thick unit of ferruginous and manganiferous siltstone has been mapped on JAMINDI and a localized occurrence of dolostone has been recognized on KENNETH RANGE. Two small outcrops of felsic volcaniclastic rock have also been mapped within the Ullawarra Formation on MILGUN and CALYIE.  The Coodardoo Formation is composed of thinly to very thickly bedded, fine- to very coarse-grained lithic quartz sandstone and pebbly sandstone, interbedded with siltstone. A thin unit of siltstone and sandstone has been mapped in the middle of the formation on ELLIOTT CREEK, ULLAWARRA, and EDMUND.  Low- to medium-grade schistose metasedimentary rocks attributed as P_-MEd-ml, P_-MEv-mk, P_-MEl-mlsd in the Big Bend Syncline on PINK HILLS are recognized as being metamorphosed equivalents of the Discovery, Devil Creek, and Ullawarra Formations, respectively.","The base of Depositional package 4 is marked by a major marine transgression that appears to have crossed the region from southwest to northeast (Martin and Thorne, 2004). Most of the evidence for pre-Depositional package 4 erosion is confined to the Pingandy Shelf. Silicified sandstone and conglomerate that occur at the base of the Discovery Formation along the southwestern margin of the Pingandy Shelf are possible remnants of a ravinement surface developed during the initial marine transgression. These basal coarse-grained units are overlain by silicified sulfidic mudstone and chert, which are interpreted to reflect deposition under the ensuing starved, anoxic basinal conditions. Because of the widespread, uniform nature of the Discovery Formation across the region, it is likely that these starved basinal conditions persisted across much of the northwestern Capricorn Orogen. During this time there appears to have been no significant movement along the major basinal structures, other than a possible northeast-block down movement of the Lyons River Fault to accommodate the increased thickness of the Discovery Formation towards this structure (Daniels, 1966; Martin and Thorne, 2004).  A more significant reactivation of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system, which was accompanied by a slight shallowing of the basin, appears to have taken place during deposition of the overlying Devil Creek Formation (Martin and Thorne, 2004). Platform facies carbonates, including intraclast grainstone and stromatolitic dolostone were deposited on the Pingandy shelf whereas the line of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system was marked by slope-facies carbonates including significant accumulations of intraformational breccia. Southwest of this line the slope-facies pass into thick, fine-grained mixed siliciclastic-carbonate basinal deposits that are thickest in the southern and central parts of the basin, suggesting the possible influence from other basement structures such as the Lyons River, Quartzite Well, and Mount Clere Faults.  Deposition of the remainder of Depositional package 4, comprising the Ullawarra and Coodardoo Formations, was characterized by further basin subsidence accompanied by a gradual increase in siliciclastic supply (Martin and Thorne, 2004). Deep-marine-shelf deposits of the Ullawarra Formation were laid down in response to uplift to the southeast of the region, as well as a northwesterly tilting of the basin floor. As was the case with deposition of the Devil Creek Formation, the Talga, Mount Vernon, Lyons River, Quartzite Well, and Mount Clere Faults probably acted as major growth structures at this time, resulting in a marked thickening of the Ullawarra Formation in the central and southern parts of the basin. Along the southern margin of the basin, fine-grained sandstones (Nanular Member) were laid down in a nearshore, shallow-marine shelf environment. Upper parts of the Ullawarra Formation were deposited during a period of significantly increased siliciclastic sediment supply, and localised shallowing to carbonate facies along the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system (Martin and Thorne, 2004). During this time basin subsidence continued to keep pace with the increased sedimentation rates. Thinly to thickly bedded turbidite facies in the upper part of the Ullawarra Formation show a southeasterly derivation and may reflect axial flow. However, limited paleocurrent data from the overlying deeper shelf sandstones of the Coodardoo Formation points to an increasing contribution from an upland area to the northwest.",,3000,,"Martin et al. (2005) note that there are important features that suggest the lower contact of the Discovery Formation at the base of Depositional package 4 is a regional disconformity. These include the very low angle truncation of underlying units at the top Depositional Package 3 and the presence of basal silicified conglomerate near Strama Bore on ELLIOTT CREEK (Zone 50, MGA 457900E 73976980N). Evidence of an erosive basal contact for the Discovery Formation appears to be confined to the area on or close to the Pingandy Shelf. Over most remaining parts of the Edmund Basin, the basal contact appears conformable and gradational (Daniels, 1966; Muhling and Brakel, 1985).  Depositional package 4 is unconformably overlain by the Backdoor Formation, the basal unit of the Collier Group.",,8,,,Mixed,3,,,,1590,,1455,9,"The age of Depositional package 4 is uncertain, but it was probably deposited between c. 1590 and 1455 Ma. The older age limit is based on geochronological data from underlying units within the Edmund Group, whereas the younger age limit comes from data obtained from felsic volcaniclastic rocks near the top of the package and also from intrusive dolerite that cross-cuts the package stratigraphy. A less conservative interpretation, based on the likely continuous nature of Depositional package 4 sedimentation, is that the entire package was deposited close to the younger age limit of c. 1455 Ma.   The maximum age of Depositional package 4 is loosely constrained by its stratigraphic position, in which it occurs at a higher stratigraphic position within the Edmund Group than the Kiangi Creek Formation in Depositional package 3. The Kiangi Creek Formation disconformably overlies mineralization in the Gooragoora and Irregully Formations at the Abra polymetallic deposit on CALYIE, which is dated to between c. 1610 and 1590 Ma (Zi et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2015).   The minimum age of c. 1455 Ma for Depositional Package 4 is derived from the ages of felsic volcaniclastic rocks within the Ullawarra Formation, and also from the age of the Narimbunna Dolerite which intrudes the package stratigraphy. Wingate et al. (GSWA 149031, 2010) and Wingate et al. (GSWA 143440, 2012) obtained maximum depositional ages of 1463 Â± 8 Ma and 1455 Â± 9 Ma from felsic volcaniclastic units within the Ullawarra Formation on MILGUN and CALYIE, respectively. These ages are interpreted to be close to depositional ages, although the youngest zircons in each sample (1&sigma;) are 1356 Â± 38 Ma and 1415 Â± 27 Ma respectively. In addition, Wingate (GSWA 148994, 2010e) acquired an age 1461 Â± 7 Ma from the youngest group of detrital zircons in a sandstone sample, taken from the Ullawarra Formation on PEEDAWARRA, although the youngest zircon in this sample is 1403 Â± 20 Ma (1&sigma;). The ages obtained from the Ullawarra Formation are within uncertainty of a  c. 1465 Ma age from the Narimbunna Dolerite (Wingate, 2002; Martin et al., 2005) and indicate that the early stages of dolerite intrusion, felsic volcanism, and Ullawarra Formation sedimentation were coeval <u>(</u>GSWA 149031, Wingate et al., 2010). Younger  ages of 1452 Ma Â± 5  and 1450 Â± 5 Ma have also been obtained from dolerite intruding Depositional packages 3 and 4 (GSWA 143450, Wingate et al., 2012; GSWA 189223, Wingate et al., 2013), indicating that the Narimbunna Dolerite magmatic event was protracted and took place over about 15 Ma.  The Coodardoo Formation at the top of Depositional package 4 has not been dated directly. However, its maximum age is thought to be close to the c. 1455 Ma age for the youngest felsic volcaniclastic rocks in the underlying Ullawarra Formation. This interpretation is based on the gradational contact between the two formations and the likely rapid deposition of the Coodardoo Formation. A c. 1070 Ma sill belonging to the Kulkatharra Dolerite (P_-WKk-od) has been intruded along the contact between the Coodardoo Formation and the overlying Backdoor Formation on ELLIOTT CREEK (Wingate, 2002) and provides a more conservative constraint on the minimum age for the Coodardoo Formation and Depositional package 4.   Sills belonging to the Waldburg Dolerite are intruded into the underlying parts of the Edmund Group on MOUNT AUGUSTUS, MANGAROON, and CANDOLLE. These sills have igneous crystallization ages of c. 1517-1505 Ma (GSWA 143445, Wingate et al., 2012; GSWA 206916, Wingate, 2015) and provide a younger age limit for the lower Edmund Group. The relationship of the Waldburg Dolerite to Depositional package 4 is unknown, and it could have been intruded into underlying parts of the Edmund Group either before or after Depositional package 4 was deposited.",No,,,1,,No,PM Approved,No,Yes,P_,MEP4,,,,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,No,No

373,6057,P_-KMe-xsl-kd,4719,Elgee Siltstone,1,"Red-brown and grey siltstone, mudstone and sandstone; basal dolomitic siltstone that is locally oolitic and stromatolitic","The Paleoproterozoic Elgee Siltstone is a relatively thin package of fine-grained sandstone and siltstone which forms part of the conformable sedimentary sequence of the Kimberley Group. The formation is underlain by the Warton Sandstone, overlain by the Pentecost Sandstone, intruded by the Hart Dolerite throughout the Kimberley region, and intruded by the Wotjulum Porphyry in the coastal west Kimberley region in the Yampi Sound area. The formation is poorly exposed and preserved compared to the rest of the Kimberley Group sediments, exposed as thin, highly weathered veneers around the surrounding commonly cliff- and ridge-forming Warton and Pentecost Sandstones. Consequently, the Elgee Siltstone is commonly eroded to produce valleys and other topographic lowland features.  The Elgee Siltstone is a dominantly fine-grained sedimentary package of thin- to medium-bedded, massive or planar parallel laminated, micaceous siltstones and fine-grained sandstones. Stromatolitic horizons have been observed in the basal lithofacies. The majority of the Elgee Siltstone was probably deposited under tidal conditions, with evidence for subaerial exposure from desiccation cracks, rain drop prints, salt casts, and probable redox banding (Derick, 1968; Owen, 1970). Shoreline or estuarine bidirectional currents (interference ripples) indicate an intertidal flat with stromatolites surviving in possible isolated tidal pools.  A minimum depositional age for the Elgee Siltstone is provided by a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age from the Wotjulum Porphyry which intrudes the entire formation, from base to top, in the Yampi Sound area, west Kimberley region (YAMPI 1:250 000). It was dated to 1740 Â± 6 Ma (Wingate et al., 2011; Sheppard et al., 2012).","The Elgee Siltstone forms thin veneers around the ridge-forming Warton and Pentecost Sandstones which it conformable interlays. As a result of its being easily weathered compared to the surrounding formations, the Elgee Siltstone is commonly eroded to produce valleys. Most of the outcrops are found in the central and east Kimberley region with minor outcrops in the west Kimberley.  In the north Kimberley region the Elgee Siltstone is exposed in the Campbell Range and is exposed in a north-northeast corridor between the Carson Escarpment and the Ashton Range.  In the east Kimberley region the formation is well-exposed in the Chamberlain River valley and the Elgee Cliffs, eroded by the Chamberlain River which runs in a northeast direction, paralleling the Durack Ranges for their entire length.  The southernmost exposes are found bordering the Baulk Face Range and in the Mueller Range. Exposures to the west are present in the Wotjulum Reverse on the YAMPI 1:250 000 map sheet.  The Elgee Siltstone covers an area approximately 4903 km 2 .","The Elgee Siltstone was probably named for the exposures in the Elgee Cliffs above the Chamberlain River in the east Kimberley, approximately 35 km north of Bedford Downs Homestead.",,"The Elgee Siltstone is a red or brown, thin-bedded, massive or planar parallel laminated micaceous siltstone or claystone with green (reduced) siltstone horizons and interbedded feldspathic and quartz-rich sandstone (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967).  The basal Teronis Member has been described in the east Kimberley region by Owen (1970) from the Elgee Cliffs that parallel the Durack Ranges on LANSDOWNE, MOUNT ELIZABETH, and LISSADELL 1:250 000 map sheets. The member is a fine-grained unit with interbedded sandstone and stromatolitic horizons. The Teronis Member has not been described from the central and west Kimberley Basin. The base of the Elgee Siltstone in the Gibb Range near to the Gibb River Road on SULLIVAN 1:100 000 (central Kimberley region; CXPMTE000252) is a medium-bedded, fine-grained, well-sorted, cross-bedded or massive quartz arenite. Up section the Elgee Siltstone becomes a thin-bedded, well-sorted micaceous quartz arenite with planar parallel laminations of red siltstone, 1-3 mm thick. In the west Kimberley region at Eagle Point on YAMPI 1:250 000 the basal lithofacies of the Elgee Siltstone is a conglomerate which grades into sandstone (Gellatly et al., 1969).  The siltstones and fine-grained sandstones of the Elgee Siltstone are commonly calcareous, cross-bedded, and ripple laminated with desiccation cracks and high ferric iron contents (Derrick, 1968; Tyler and Griffin, 1993). Both asymmetric and interference ripples have been described by Tyler and Griffin (1993) from the coastal exposures in the west Kimberley region and in the Wotjulum Reserve. Rare cobbles of quartz sandstone in a granule sandstone matrix were also observed in the west Kimberley region (Tyler and Griffin, 1993).  Gellatly and Sofoulis (1969) noted that the sandstone to siltstone ratio increases up section and to the west in the exposures in the Drysdale River National Park on the DRYSDALE 1:250 000 map sheet. The decrease in sandstone up section was also noted by Derrick (1968) to the west of the Drysdale River National Park in exposures between the Carson Escarpment and Ashton Range and further to the south on the Gardner Plateau on ASHTON 1:250 000.  The upper Elgee Siltstone exposed in the Precipice Range (towards the southeast end of the King Leopold Ranges) on LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 contains a purple, fine-grained, hematitic sandstone with numerous clay pellets (Griffin et al., 1993). Similarly, siltstone and ferruginous sandstone and feldspathic sandstone were found in the upper Elgee Siltstone in the exposures in and around the Campbell Range in the north Kimberley region on MEDUSA BANKS 1:250 000 (Plumb and Perry, 1971).","The Elgee Siltstone in the finest grained formation in the Kimberley Group representing deposition under relatively quiescent conditions compared to the abundantly cross-bedded sandstones of the Warton Sandstone and the Pentecost Sandstone.  Numerous sedimentary structures within the lower Elgee Siltstone are highly indicative of a depositional setting with periods of subaerial exposure (e.g. desiccation cracks and raindrop imprints within the Elgee Cliffs; Owen, 1970). Alternating horizons of red and green siltstone are probably redox related and produced by subaerial exposure. These data suggest a possible tidal setting for the lower Elgee Siltstone (Derrick, 1968; Owen, 1970). Further to this symmetrical and interference ripples described by Tyler and Griffin (1993) in the west Kimberley region could possibly suggest and estuarine influence or possible tidal or upper shoreface influence on the deposition of these rocks.  Likewise, on CHAMBERLAIN 1:100 000 the stromatolites discovered must have grown in a shallow (probably oligotrophic) water column within the photic zone (< 100 m water depth). This provides a maximum water depth for the lower Elgee Siltstone. Recent and ancient stromatolites, however, can grow in intertidal settings (e.g. Hamelin Pool, Western Australia) so these structures probably grew in the same depositional setting described above, surviving in isolated tidal pools or areas of restricted current energies (possibly lagoon-type settings).  Cross-beds further up section in the Elgee Siltstone indicate a paleoflow from the northwest (Gellatly and Sofloulis, 1969). Ripple orientations and flute casts indicate a shoreline to the north and east with a paleoslope to the southwest and paleoflow from the northwest (Owen, 1970).",30,480,,"The Elgee Siltstone is a conformable unit within the Kimberley Group, conformable on the Warton Sandstone and under the Pentecost Sandstone. The contact with the overlying Pentecost Sandstone is sharp in the Precipice Range (LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000) due to the strong lithological contrast between fine-grained hematitic sandstone of the Elgee Siltstone and the quartz-dominated sandstone of the Pentecost Sandstone (Griffin et al., 1993).   The Yampi Formation unconformably overlies the Elgee Siltstone around Eagle Point on the east side of Collier Bay and the Yule Entrance to the Walcott Inlet on YAMPI 1:250 000.  The formation is intruded by the Hart Dolerite at all stratigraphic levels through the Kimberley region. The Elgee Siltstone exposures in the Wotjalum Reserve, around Talbot Bay, the Yampi Sound, and Strickland Bay on YAMPI 1:250 000 are intruded by the Wotjulum Porphyry which was emplaced parallel to bedding from the contact with the underlying Warton Sandstone to the contact with the overlying Pentecost Sandstone (Sheppard et al., 2012).",,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,1791,,1740,,"The Elgee Siltstone has not been directly dated. The maximum age of the Elgee Siltstone is constrained by the Hart Dolerite. Sills of the Hart Dolerite extensively intruded the Speewah Group and lower Kimberley Group which are older than the Elgee Siltstone. Dolerite sills are contiguous with basalt lava in the Carson Volcanics and together constitute the Hart-Carson Large Igneous Province. Sheppard et al. (2012) reported U-Pb ages from a granophyric unit within the Hart Dolerite at 1799 Â± 17 Ma from zircon (GA 8759.8003) and 1795 Â± 15 Ma from baddeleyite (GSWA 113574).

It is dominated by vitric rhyolite, mainly as flows with lesser pyroclastic falls and subvolcanic intrusions, and includes feldspar-phyric, spherulitic, perlitic, and flow-banded varieties. It also locally includes fine- to coarse-grained volcaniclastic and siliciclastic rocks including clast- to matrix-supported conglomerate. It is well developed in the region immediately to the west of Barrow Range, on MOUNT EVELINE, although it also outcrops sporadically in the southeastern and central parts of BENTLEY, where it is overlain by diamictite that forms the base of the Pussy Cat Group. Throughout much of this region, the diamictite is only thinly developed and separates the Eliza Formation from the overlying Kaarnka Group. The outcrop (and interpreted bedrock) distribution pattern of the Eliza Formation, like that of the overlying Kaarnka Group, is oval in shape and is interpreted to define a caldera structure. Age constraints place volcanic deposition of the rocks between 1077 and 1047 Ma.","The Eliza Formation is well developed in the region immediately to the west of Barrow Range, along the eastern edge of MOUNT EVELINE, and it also outcrops sporadically from the southeastern corner to the central region of BENTLEY, where it is overlain by diamictite that forms the base of the Pussy Cat Group.","The name &mdash; Eliza Formation &mdash; is derived from Mount Eliza, a topographical feature in the northeastern part of MOUNT EVELINE.",,"The Eliza Formation is dominated by massive to flow-banded, highly vitric rhyolite, mainly as lavas but also probably including subvolcanic sills and possibly rheomorphic pyroclastic rocks.

Several samples of the Mount Palgrave Group have given dates that have also been interpreted to be the age of igneous crystallization. These include: 1070 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 194800; GSWA, preliminary data), 1069 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 195116; GSWA, preliminary data), and 1068 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 195114; GSWA, preliminary data) from the Eliza Formation; 1070 Â± 10 Ma (GSWA 195115; GSWA, preliminay data) and 1064 Â± 5 Ma (GSWA 195678; GSWA, preliminary data) from the Scamp Formation; and 1065 Â± 9 Ma (GSWA 195230; GSWA preliminary data) from the Mount Waugh Formation.

It is dominated by medium-grained, thin to thick-bedded, cross-bedded, white to pale-brown, feldspathic sandstone. The weathered surface develops a distinctly orange-brown weathering skin masking the colour of the fresh rock. Typically about 500 m thick in the south (RAWLINSON 1:250 000 scale map sheet), but thinning to the north, it form a useful marker between the more recessive red-brown sandstones and siltstones of the Carnegie (below) and the Maurice Formations.  It occupies the same stratigraphic position as the less extensive Sir Frederick Conglomerate, and the rounded pebble clasts in the pebbly facies of the Ellis Sandstone are of similar composition to those of the Sir Frederick Conglomerate (quartzite, silicified sandstone, metasandstone, vein quartz, chert). Wells et al. (1964) report that these units interfinger, for example in the Crockett Range (northern RAWLINSON 1:250 000 scale map sheet area), but the relationships are not well exposed. The Ellis Sandstone is interpreted as a braided fluvial deposit transporting sediment to the north-northeast away from topography uplifted during the 580-520 Ma Petermann Orogeny to the south (Haines et al., 2015). The age of the formation could thus range from late Ediacaran to early Cambrian. The formation is assigned to Supersequence 4 of the Centralian Superbasin, using the Supersequence nomenclature of Walter et al. (1995).","The Ellis Sandstone is restricted to the western Amadeus Basin. Outcrops are currently mapped on the MACDONALD, RAWLINSON and RYAN 1:250 000 map sheet areas in WA, and the western edge of MOUNT RENNIE in the NT.

It is inferred to be a lateral equivalent of, and to interfinger with, the Sir Frederick Conglomerate (Wells et al., 1964), but the relationships are not well exposed. More regionally, the Ellis Sandstone is correlated with unit 2 of the Winnall beds in the southwest NT Amadeus Basin, and to part of the Arumbera Sandstone of the northeast Amadeus Basin (Haines et al., 2012, 2015). The Ellis Sandstone is assigned to Supersequence 4 of the Centralian Superbasin, using the Supersequence nomenclature of Walter et al. (1995). ",,"The Ellis Sandstone is dominated by medium-grained, thin to thickly-bedded, moderately to poorly-sorted sandstone. Coarse-grained sandstone is interbedded locally, but is rarely a significant component, and fine-grained sandstone is rare. The sandstone is locally pebbly, which can include sparse rounded cobbles. Pebbly facies are mainly restricted to southern outcrops. Pebble and cobble clasts are mainly of quartzite and metasandstone, with minor vein quartz and chert. The clast assemblage is similar to that of the potentially laterally equivalent Sir Frederick Conglomerate. When freshly broken the sandstone is white to pale brown (rarely pale pink) in colour, but typically develops an orange-brown weathering skin. Although more quartz-rich than the underlying Carnegie or overlying Maurice Formations, the Ellis Sandstone is feldspathic and often displays minor white clay matrix (presumably kaolinite from breakdown of feldspars). Heavy mineral bands are present locally. Wells et al. (1964) report a unit of pale grey massive calcareous Sandstone about 10 m thick within the Ellis Sandstone at Plover Hill (northern RAWLINSON 1:250 000 scale map sheet area). While siltstone interbeds are very rarely observed, beds containing mud clasts are common, suggested that any deposited silt was quickly reworked due to the prevailing high energy conditions. Cross-bedding is abundant, and can locally reach or exceed metre-scale. Trough cross-bedded is most abundant, but tabular cross-bedding is also observed. Paleocurrent data measured from cross-beds indicates a mean flow direction towards the north-northeast, but can vary from northerly to easterly locally (Haines et al., 2015). Current lineations on the surface of planar-laminated beds are also abundant and indicate high flow velocity. Current ripples are locally observed, but are not as common as other sedimentary structures.  ","The Ellis Sandstone is interpreted to be mainly of braided fluvial origin (Haines and Allen, 2014). Paleocurrent directions determined from trough and tabular cross-beds typically trend towards the north-northeast away from the Petermann Orogen (Musgrave region), the assumed provenance based on detrital zircon data (Haines and Allen, 2014; Haines et al., 2015).",,500,,"The Ellis Sandstone overlies the Carnegie Formation and is overlain by the Maurice Formation. The contacts are poorly exposed, but appear concordant and are possibly conformable at most sections. The unit is locally overlain by the Mu Formation with angular unconformity in the Mu Hills. It is also unconformably overlain by the Paterson Formation in areas where the Canning Basin onlaps the Amadeus Basin. The Ellis Sandstone is interpreted to interfinger with the Sir Frederick Conglomerate (Wells et al., 1964), although the relationships are difficult to confirm in the field due to poor outcrop (Haines et al., 2012, 2015).",,17,,,,4,,,,635,,510,,"One sample of Ellis Sandstone (GSWA 143800) has been analysed by detrital zircon geochronology (Wingate et al., 2013; Haines et al., 2015, 2016). The youngest zircon, with an age of 967 Â± 11 Ma (1&sigma;), provides a maximum depositional age for the unit, but this is much older than the age implied by other constraints.   Haines et al. (2012, 2015) correlate the Ellis Sandstone with unit 2 of the Winnall beds in the southwestern NT Amadeus Basin. The Winnall beds are in turn correlated to the biostratigraphically dated Arumbera Sandstone of the north-central and northeastern Amadeus Basin (Haines et al., 2012, 2015). On this basis, the Ellis Sandstone could range from late Ediacaran to early Cambrian in age. No biostratigraphic evidence for age has been found in WA. Ranford et al. (1965) mention  numerous indeterminate fossil tracks and trails  in Winnall beds unit 2 in the south-central part of the NT Amadeus Basin, additionally referring to a form comparable with the lower Cambrian  Syringomorpha  at one locality.

5034,6345,CZ-EU-xkl-sz,1,Eucla Group,1,Bioclastic limestone with sandstone near basin margin,"The Eucla Group encompasses the Oligocene and Miocene component of the Cenozoic succession of the Eucla Basin. It is of late Oligocene to middle Miocene age, based on foraminifers and varied macrofossils. Although included by most earlier workers, the Eocene Wilson Bluff Limestone is here excluded from the group as there is a significant unconformity spanning the early Oligocene, separating two distinct transgressive phases. A disconformity within the group separates the Abrakurrie (late Oligocene-early Miocene) and Nullarbor (late early to early middle Miocene) Limestones.  The Eucla Group is characterised by bioclastic limestone, commonly recrystallized near the surface. It is markedly bryozoal in the Oligocene. The limestone is transitional towards the northern basin margin into more siliciclastic facies of nearshore to coastal Colville Sandstone and, further north, the paralic Plumridge Formation. Onshore, the group is generally less than 100 m thick but could be substantially thicker offshore to the south - in Jerboa 1 there is approximately 1150 m of Cenozoic strata.","The Eucla Group covers almost all of the Eucla Basin, as its uppermost unit, the Nullarbor Limestone, marks the highpoint of the Miocene transgression. The Plumridge Formation and Colville Sandstone extend discontinuously further north, over Mesozoic and Paleozoic rocks. Lowry (1970) showed the Colville Sandstone as extending in a broad belt across the northern Eucla Basin up to 100 km across. The maximum thickness of the group onshore is essentially the sum of the Abrakurrie and Nullarbor Limestones, at most about 100 m.  Southwards, the only offshore intersection adjoining Western Australia is in Jerboa 1, where the upper 1004 m was not logged or sampled, and the interval from 1004 to 1103 m interpreted as Eocene Wilson Bluff Limestone (Huebner, 1980). Totterdell et al. (2000) later showed the interval from 1004 to about 1080 m as Nullarbor Limestone, but placed the Eocene-Oligocene boundary at about 1030 m, thus arbitrarily extending the lower range of the Nullarbor Limestone substantially.","The Eucla Group is named after the settlement just west of the South Australian border. The group was named by Singleton (1954) for the combined Wilson Bluff and Nullarbor Limestones, and fully defined by Lowry (1970), who also included all other Tertiary (Eocene and Miocene) rocks in the Eucla Basin, following Lowry (1968). It is here restricted to the Oligocene - Miocene section, as there is a substantial unconformity between these and the underlying Eocene rocks, which are the product of a different major high sea level stand. A disconformity remains within the group in the onshore Eucla Basin, between the Oligocene-Early Miocene Abrakurrie Limestone and the Middle-Late Miocene Nullarbor Limestone, but this is believed to a shorter duration hiatus in deposition, producing a marine hardground that may grade southwards into a correlative conformity. The Toolina Limestone of Lowry (1968, 1970) was abandoned by Li et al. (1996), who considered the type area was Eocene in age although a different facies to the other Eocene limestone unit, the Wilson Bluff Limestone.   The name was not used by Hocking (1990), possibly because of the unconformity apparent in the group as originally defined. It is retained here solely to encompass the Oligocene-Miocene sedimentary package, similar to the Oligocene- Miocene Cape Range Group of the Northern Carnarvon Basin and to successions further east along Australia's southern margin in the Murray and Otway Basins.",,"The Eucla Group consists largely of bioclastic calcarenite, markedly bryozoal at the base in the Abrakurrie Limestone, grading laterally into siliciclastic facies towards the northern basin margin. A microbial, mechanically deposited rudstone biostrome is widespread at the base of the Miocene Nullarbor Limestone.","The Eucla Group was deposited on a south-facing carbonate-dominated marine shelf, at depths of 50 to 100 m onshore.

3779,31386,D-_fa-kt,1,Faure Formation,1,"Dolomite, mudstone, fine-grained sandstone (subsurface only)","The Faure Formation consists of siltstone and mudstone, dolomite and limestone, and near the base and top, fine-grained sandstone. Crinkly laminated dolomite formed as microbial mats. Sub-horizontal gypsum veins are present in some wells, and may have formed during late mobilization of evaporates in the underlying Dirk Hartog Group. It was deposited in oxidising saline to hypersaline coastal sabhka and lagoonal environments, with possible marine incursions. It is differentiated from the Dirk Hartog Group by its more oxidised appearance and contrasting sulphur isotope values.  The Faure Formation is conformably overlain by the Kopke Sandstone, and rests disconformably on the Coburn Formation or older units of the Dirk Hartog Group. It is presently recognised only in the Shark Bay area, as far south as Coburn 1. Intersections initially recognised further north in Wandgaee 1 and Mooka 1 were later reassigned to other units. Its age is primarily constrained by the Kopke Sandstone above and the Coburn Formation below, and by palynomorphs in Coburn 1.","The Faure Formation is preserved in the Shark Bay region; other interpreted intersections as far north as the Wandagee region were re-evaluated by Mory et al. (1998, 2003). The maximum thickness is 149 m, in Tamala 1 between 425 - 574 m (Iasky et al., 1999; note this differs substantially from Gorter et al's (1994) pick of 396 to 524 m). Other intersections are 72 m in Coburn 1 (505.5 - 577.5 m), 92 m in Yaringa 1 (type section, 855 - 947 m), 102 m in Hamelin Pool 1 (852 - 954 m; Gorter et al's 1994 interpretation was 130 m, between 821 and 951 m) and Hamelin Pool 2 (791 - 893 m). Yasin and Mory (1999) recognised Faure Formation in Mooka 1 between 183.5 and 281 m, but Mory et al. (2003) presented a revised interpretation of the units intersected and considered the Kopke Sandstone rested directly on Coburn Formation. Gorter et al. (1994) recognised Faure Formation in Wandagee 1 (357 to 427 m) and Quail 1 (3121 - 3232 m) but Mory et al. (1998) assigned these sections to the Nanyarra Sandstone.   The Faure Formation may correlate with the lowermost Tumblagooda Sandstone in the Murchison Gorge and scattered inland exposures further south and east.","The Faure Formation was named and described by Gorter et al. (1994), presumably after Faure Island in Shark Bay. The type section is between 820 and 947 m in Yaringa 1 and was previously included in the lowest Kopke Sandstone and uppermost Dirk Hartog 'Formation' (now placed in the uppermost Coburn Formation of the Dirk Hartog Group). Gorter et al. noted the upper boundary is not obvious in Yaringa 1 or Tamala 1. In Hamelin Pool 1 it is at a increase in gamma ray and change in the sonic log only partially seen in Yaringa 1. The lower boundary is a disconformity on the Dirk Hartog Group (Gorter et al., 1994; Mory et al., 1998).",,"The Faure Formation consists of siltstone, claystone and mudstone, dolomite and limestone, and near the base and top, reddish fine-grained sandstone. The most detailed descriptions of the Faure Formation are of the fully cored section in Coburn 1 (Yasin and Mory, 1999). The sandstone intervals at the top and base appear to be less pronounced in Coburn 1 than further north. Crinkly laminated dolomite and limestone formed as microbial mats. Sub-horizontal gypsum veins are present in some wells, and may have formed during late mobilization of evaporates from the underlying Dirk Hartog Group.","The Faure Formation was deposited in a oxidising, low-energy saline to hypersaline setting, probably in large shallow coastal lagoons and sabkhas (Mory and Yasin, 1998; Yasin and Mory, 1999). There may have been limited marine incursions. Breccias and textures indicate evaporitic conditions and periodic dessication, and thin horizons and fracture fills of coarse sandstone to granule conglomerate within mudstone formed during flash floods and subsequent strong winds (Mory and Yasin, 1998). Gorter et al. (1994) suggested a dominantly non-marine environment, noting that fish remains from the central part of the Faure Formation in Yaringa 1 were in themselves not particularly environmentally diagnostic.",,149,,"Yasin and Mory (1999) recorded a sharp, abrupt contact between the Faure and Coburn Formations in Coburn 1, with a sharp change from grey dolomite below to oxidised redbeds above.

The contacts of the Frank Scott Formation with the underlying Miller Basalt and Gamminah Conglomerate, and with the overlying Lilian Formation, are transitional and conformable. The youngest crystallization age for rocks of the Warakurna Supersuite, which includes all magmatic rocks of the Bentley Supergroup, is c. 1040 Ma (e.g. Close et al., 2003) and is likely a realistic minimum age constraint on deposition of the Frank Scott Formation.","The Frank Scott Formation forms a discontinuous, arcuate, southeast- to east-trending, gently south-dipping (~25&deg;) outcrop belt about 60 km long in the southwestern part of the west Musgrave Province. The westernmost outcrop is formed by a small isolated mound about 5 km north of Warburton on the western side of Elder Creek. East of Warburton, between Mission Flats and Miller Hill, a more continuous outcrop strip of the Frank Scottt Formation extends for approximately 15 km along the southern side of the Warburton Range. Farther east, isolated outcrops exist near Gamminah Soak south of Mount Herbert. The easternmost outcrops are in the Frank Scott Hill area, where the Frank Scott Formation forms an approximately 15 km long, east trending, semicontinuous outcrop belt. On WARBURTON RANGE, the Frank Scott Formation has a thickness of about 400 m. This is comparable with the 400-500 m thickness of the limestone-bearing succession at Frank Scott Hill in the east on MOUNT EVELINE.","The name Frank Scott Formation was first used by Daniels (1971) on the TALBOT 1:250 000 map sheet, and is clearly derived from Frank Scott Hill on the MOUNT EVELINE map sheet. Daniels (1974) described the unit but did not specify a type section or area.  Note that the Frank Scott Hill itself consists of gabbroic rocks of the Warakurna Supersuite.",,"The Frank Scott Formation was originally described as very finely laminated siltstones, dolomitic siltstones, shales, and, fawn and grey-weathering dolomites, with minor sandstones and cherts (Daniels, 1974). The succession of shales, mudstones, and siltstones to the north of Frank Scott Hill has now been incorporated into the Gamminah Conglomerate, as a genetic relationship has been established between these units.  The limestones of the Frank Scott Formation typically have a bluish-grey colour, although ochreous varieties also occur. They commonly form layers ranging in thickness from less than 1 cm to a maximum of about 2 m. Some stratigraphic levels are characterized by thinly bedded limestone-sandstone-mudstone rhythmites. Especially in the lower part of the formation the limestones commonly have a clastic appearance containing sand-sized carbonate grains and up to 10 mm long, parallel aligned filamentous or flaky fragments of unknown origin. Low-angle cross-bedding, sharp erosional bases and normal grading are common in these limestones. Some limestone layers are rich in mudstone rip-up clasts and some sandstone layers contain small mudstone pebbles or large limestone clasts. At one locality, a prominent limestone layer appears to be oolitic and contains isolated fragments of reddish mudstone clasts. Limestone layers in the higher parts of the formation are generally fine-grained and massive. Locally, wavy laminated limestones can be found which probably were microbial mat deposits. Immediately north of Frank Scott Hill a number of limestone layers contain metre-sized, pillow-shaped stromatolites which are internally laminated and locally contain small domal structures. These stromatolites are described in more detail in Cockbain (1967) and Daniels (1974).  The sandstone and limestone layers are intercalated in a fine-grained package comprising bluish-grey, laminated to massive, partly pyrite-bearing mudstones, light-grey cherty mudstones, olive-green shales and siltstones, and very fine-grained sandstone-siltstone intercalations. Locally, olive-green to bluish-grey microbial laminites form resistant, siliceous mudstone horizons. In the higher parts of the formation, dark-grey cherts and carbonaceous mudstones also occur.","The rocks of the Frank Scott Formation were deposited in a fairly extensive, shallow but deepening, lacustrine or marine water body within a slowly subsiding basin.  ",,,,"The Frank Scott Formation conformably overlies the Miller Basalt on WARBURTON RANGE with the transition characterized by interbanded thin basalt flows, thin siltstones, and dolomites (Daniels, 1974). On MOUNT EVELINE, the Frank Scott Formation conformably overlies the upper, sandy part of the Gamminah Conglomerate. The boundary between these two formations is very transitional and the base of the Frank Scott Formation is placed at the base of the first limestone layer.  The Lilian Formation conformably overlies the Frank Scott Formation. This contact again is very gradational in the field as both the upper part of the Frank Scott Formation and the main part of the Lilian Formation are dominated by shales and mudstones. In satellite images, however, the contact between the two formations commonly appears fairly sharp and readily traceable. In the field the boundary is mainly characterized by a colour change of the shales and mudstones. In the Frank Scott Formation they are greyish where fresh, are locally rich in organic-carbon, and commonly weather to turquoise hues. In contrast, the shales and mudstones of the Lilian Formation are ochreous to olive-green on fresh surfaces and show distinct reddish-brown weathering colouration. Another aid to defining the boundary between these two formations is the distribution of carbonates. The upper part of the Frank Scott Formation contains isolated lenses and ellipsoidal bodies of partly stromatolitic limestone, whereas the Lilian Formation is essentially devoid of carbonates. ",,17,,,,4,,,,1057,,1030,,"Constraints on the maximum depositional age of the Mission Group are derived from the crystallization age of the underlying Thomas Rhyolite of the Cassidy Group. A sample of the Thomas Rhyolite yielded an age of 1057 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 174691; Kirkland et al., 2012). However, it is likely that zircon crystals within this sample included a large number of antecrysts and that the quoted mean age should be regarded as a maximum age of rhyolite volcanism (Smithies et al., 2013). Constraints on the minimum depositional age of the Mission Group are from the 825-800 Ma depositional age for the Bitter Springs Formation (Maidment et al., 2007), which overlies equivalents of the Townsend Quartzite in the Amadeus Basin.

2961,6902,P_-_fr-xci-sf,1,Frere Formation,1,"Granular iron-formation, granular siliceous iron-formation, peloidal chert, siltstone, and sandstone","The Frere Formation ( P_Efr-xci-sf ) records the onset of major iron oxide precipitation within the Earaheedy Basin and consists of at least four major granular iron-formation intervals, separated by major shale, siltstone, and sandstone bands, and minor carbonate. This granular iron formation is an important iron resource, is similar to the Superior iron formations of North America in age and lithology (Rasmussen et al., 2012), and is one of the few granular iron-formations recorded outside North America (Goode et al., 1983; Trendall, 2002). Deposition of the Frere Formation was in shallow marine to coastal conditions, possibly with intermittent emergence, along a northwest- to north-deepening coastline unbarred except perhaps for some coastal lagoons. The coincidence in age of the Frere Formation with the Superior iron formations strongly suggests global oceanic chemistry controlled iron formation deposition (Rasmussen et al., 2012). With the age of the basal Frere Formation now established as c. 1.88 to 1.9 Ga (Rasmussen et al., 2012), a correlation with banded- and granular-iron formations in the Robinson Range Formation (Martin, 1998), and possibly with thin banded-iron formation in the upper Labouchere Formation (Martin, 1998), both to the west-northwest, is feasible and agrees with westwards deepening and fining facies trends in the Frere Formation across the Earaheedy Basin.   The total thickness of the Frere Formation was estimated by Pirajno et al. (2009) to be about 600 m, somewhat less than the 1200-1300 m estimated by Bunting (1986). The formation can be seen to rest sharply on the Yelma Formation in drillcore in the Frere Range, and is unconformably overlain by the Chiall Formation (Miningarra Group).  The Frere Formation contains at its top the Windidda Member, and several lithologically based sub-units have been recognized on some map sheets. It is now excluded from the Tooloo Group, as it is unconformable on the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite beneath.","The Frere Formation extends around both synclinal limbs of the Earaheedy Basin, including the nose of the syncline on the west on MERRIE, FAIRBAIRN, and METHWIN. To the southeast on the southern limb, from GRANITE PEAK to VON TREUER, the width of the outcrop belt increases progressively as dips lessen. North of the synclinal axis, it is generally tightly folded and deformed with considerable fault repetition, culminating in a highly deformed zone on FAIRBAIRN, METHWIN, RHODES, MUDAN, GLENAYLE, northernmost EARAHEEDY, and LEE STEERE  On northern RHODES and on BEYONDIE, virtually undeformed Frere Formation is preserved north of this zone. Because of this sharp decrease in deformation, the zone is interpreted as marking an underlying suture at the northern edge of the Yilgarn Craton. A gap in outcrop separates the Frere Formation from possibly correlative iron formations of the Padbury Group.  Pirajno et al. (2009) considered the Frere Formation to be about 600 m thick, in contrast to Bunting's (1986) estimate of 1200 to 1300 m. Jones (2004) estimated a thickness of about 800 m on WONGAWOL.","The Frere Formation is named after the Frere Range on NABBERU 1:250 000 sheet. The type section is in the Frere Range between approximately 265900E 71536200N and 269150E 7159200N. About 200 m of the middle Frere Formation is well exposed here (Bunting, 1986), but no single section spans the entire formation.  The Frere Formation was originally an integral part of the Tooloo Subgroup (now Group) and was shown on mapsheets as  P_Ef , but was excluded by Occhipinti et al. (2017) following the documentation of an unconformity between it and underlying units by Rasmussen et al. (2012), Sheppard et al. (2016), and Occhipinti et al. (2017), based on detailed geochronology over the boundary and close examination of drill core. The unconformity cannot be unequivocally demonstrated from outcrop, due to inadequate exposure. The Tooloo Group now contains the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite (raised from Member status) and the Yelma Formation.",,"The Frere Formation consists of granular iron-formation, granular chert, chert, jasper, shale, and siltstone with minor sandstone.   Granular iron-formation consists of granular iron-oxide beds or granular chert beds interbedded with chert and jasper, and shale and siltstone, which are locally iron-rich. On WONGAWOL (Jones, 2004), granular iron-oxide beds and granular chert beds are generally less than 10 cm thick, although locally they can be up to 20 cm thick. Granular iron-oxide beds are composed of hematite, jasper, and chert peloids, oolites, and oncolites in a chert or jasper cement. Granular chert beds are composed of variably ferruginous chert and chalcedonic peloids, oolites, and oncolites in a ferruginous chert or chalcedonic cement. Iron oxides and chert grains range from granule to medium sand (1-3 mm) size, but are typically coarse sand-sized. The variable sphericity of granules is mainly a function of early diagenetic compaction, and the lack of structure in some granules could relate to diagenesis. Partially recrystallized grains are commonly concentrically laminated, with recrystallization enhancing the original structure of the grains. Septarian cracks are common in peloids, oolites, and oncolites, and were probably developed during diagenesis. Angular to subrounded, mostly tabular intraclasts of chert or jasper are common in granular iron-oxide and granular chert beds, and are typically up to 7 cm long. Locally, intraclasts represent in situ reworking of underlying partially lithified chert, jasper, siltstone, and mudstone beds.   Granular iron formation is commonly cross-bedded in sets up to about 40 cm thick, indicating traction current deposition in shallow water. Pinch and swell structures to boudinaged beds of granular iron formation and granular  siliceous formation are locally common, suggesting plastic gels developed shortly after deposition, which were than subject to unequal loading by later deposits. Silty and cherty horizons are interbedded, and lower in the formation, peloidal carbonate horizons with microbial clumps and small stromatolitic structures are present. The grain size of the iron formations decreases to the northwest along the outcrop belt, with banded iron formation and finer grained granular iron formation in the westernmost part of the basin. Siliciclastic intervals are mostly silty, but sandstone is present locally, and increases in quantity to the east. Jones (2004) estimated the proportion of granular iron-formation to shale and siltstone on WONGAWOL was about one-third of that for the type section on NABBERU. Fine grained calcarenites and sandy calcarenites are present low in the Frere Formation on WONGAWOL.  Siltstone and shale are interbedded with iron formation at all scales. In the lower part of the Frere Formation, thick siltstone and shale units, and siltstone and shale interbedded with chert or jasper horizons are typically parallel-planar laminated with minor cross-lamination. Cross-lamination, and symmetric, asymmetric, and interference ripple marks are more common in these units in the upper part of the Frere Formation. Paleocurrent directions are dominantly towards the northwest. Minor thin (<5 cm) granular iron-oxide or granular chert beds are present within these horizons, and become more abundant close to the transitional contact with granular iron and chert horizons. Many of the chert beds represent secondary silicification of fine-grained siltstone beds, with a lateral transition from unsilicified mudstone into chert preserved in several areas. Siltstone and shale units are similar to those in the Yelma and Chiall Formations.  From field observations, Jones (2004) considered granular siliceous units and mixed siltstone, shale, and chert units were the product of secondary silicification due to hydrothermal fluid flow along major structures, fluctuations in iron and silica supply during deposition, weathering associated with Late Paleozoic continental scale glaciation, or a combination of these processes. Chert grains and cement in granular chert beds located on or proximal to interpreted faults are typically strongly recrystallized with localized crackle breccias infilled with quartz. In granular chert 5.4 km northeast of Paddy Bore on WONGAWOL (366200E 7091900N), these cracks are surrounded by silicified haloes.  The Frere Formation records the onset of major iron oxide precipitation within the Earaheedy Basin and consists of up to four major granular iron-formation intervals, separated by at least three major shale and siltstone bands, and minor carbonate. This granular iron formation is an important iron resource, is similar to the Superior iron formations in age and lithology (Rasmussen et al., 2012), and is one of a few of these types of iron formations recorded outside of North America (Goode et al., 1983; Trendall, 2002). Hall and Goode (1978), Goode et al. (1983) and Bunting (1986) found textural similarities with iron formations of the Lake Superior region of North America. Both show peloidal, oolitic, and oncolitic textures; orthochemical and allochemical cements; iron-rich chlorite; and accessory minerals such as minnesotaite and stilpnomelane. These features were interpreted to result from chemical deposition followed by limited reworking of the sediment while still plastic (Beukes and Klein, 1990, 1992).    ","Primary sedimentary structures, in particular cross-bedding in both granular iron formation and sandstone intervals, and asymmetric and interference ripple forms, and limited paleocurrent measurements indicate shallow water deposition for the Frere Formation in general, on an open north- to northwest-facing coastline deepening to the northwest and with more terrigenous influence to the southeast. Jones (2004) suggested a quiet water, possibly lagoonal setting for the basal Frere Formation on WONGAWOL, based on preserved sedimentary structures.  Akin (2009) proposed a similar setting, during a marine transgression composed of higher frequency sea level fluctuations that generated five parasequences. Each parasequence Akin recognized ranges upwards from a basal hummocky cross-stratified sandstone, through microbially laminated mudstone to trough cross-bedded grainstone, and Akin interpreted them as recording progradation of intertidal and tidal channel deposits over middle shelf deposits, along an arid coastline marked by eolian influx. Akin recognized eolian dunes facies, beach facies, and interpreted mud cracks as subaerial rather than synaereses cracks. Stromatolites and microbial siltstone were suggested to be upper intertidal and supratidal, and low-angle cross-bedded quartz arenites to be eolian beach facies. A lagoonal to nearshore and coastal setting is also feasible for the microbially dominated units and a shoreface to foreshore origin for the sandstone units.",600,1200,,"The Frere Formation is unconformable on the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite and Yelma Formation. This can be seen in drillcore in the Frere Range (RGC Teague TDH1 andTDH28, held at Perth Core Library) but not in outcrop, and is confirmed by radiometric dating of micro-tuffs slightly below and above the boundary (Rasmussen et al., 2012; Sheppard et al., 2016). The contact is placed at the highest stromatolitic dolomite where possible, and peloidal ironstone occurs a few metres at most above the contact.  The top contact is generally a sharp contact with the Wandiwarra Member, where exposed. This is generally the lowest appearance of fine-grained glauconitc sandstone.",,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,1891,8,1808,,"Rasmussen et al. (2012) dated zircons from tuffaceous beds in drillcore through the lowermost Frere Formation as 1891 +/- 8 Ma, 1890 +/- 10 Ma, and 1885 +/- 18 Ma. This makes the Fr&egrave;re Formation coincident with the late Paleoproterozoic iron formations of North America (Rasmussen et al., 2012), rather than anomalously younger as thought earlier (Pirajno et al., 2004, 2009; Matonia, 2009). A minimum constraint was previously taken as the 1.8 Ga age of detrital zircons from the base of the Mulgarra Sandstone, the youngest unit of the Earaheedy Basin succession (Halilovic et al., 2004), but Sheppard et al. (2016) doubted the validity of Halilovic et al.'s data and interpretation, and considered that the youngest reliable ages from available data of detrital zircons in the Earaheedy Basin succession was about 1865 Ma. They raised the possibility that the age of authigenic monazite in the Sweetwaters Dolomite (Muhling et al., 2012) might constrain not just the Sweetwaters Dolomite (which previously had member status within the Yelma Formation) and Yelma Formation but also the entire succession of the Earaheedy Basin.  A sharp boundary between the Frere Formation and the underlying Sweetwaters Well Dolomite can be seen in drill core from TDH 28 and TDH 01 in the Frere Range (Occhipinti et al., 2-17). The lithology of the basal Frere Formation is sandstone in one hole, and siltstone in the other. Sheppard et al. (2016) dated tuff beds in the uppermost underlying unit, the Sweetwaters Dolomite, as c. 1950 Ma, so a hiatus in deposition of c. 60 Ma is probable.",No,,,752,,No,DE in Progress,No,Yes,P_,_fr,,13,19,,MIGSDRH,2.02E+13,,Yes,No

467,25917,D-_tg-sg,466,Gabba Gabba Member,1,"Pebble conglomerate, cross-bedded, interbedded with lesser very coarse-grained sandstone, bioturbated locally","The Gabba Gabba Member is a useful marker horizon near the top of FA3 (upper fluvial-dominated phase) of the Tumblagooda Sandstone. It consists of granule to pebble conglomerate, pebbly sandstone, and pebble conglomerate stringers within very coarse -grained sandstone. Clasts are mostly quartz and chert, sub-angular to sub-rounded, set in coarse to very coarse-grained gritty quartz sandstone, in a reasonably distinctive interval 1 to 2 m thick. Its age is inferred to be Early Devonian, from plant debris much lower in the Tumblagooda Sandstone, but the redbed nature of the Tumblagooda Sandstone as a whole, and its dissimilarity to well dated Middle and Upper Devonian rocks in the subsurface to the north and exposed long the eastern basin basin margin, makes correlation with these rocks unlikely.   Its validity as a single marker horizon is confirmed by a paleomagnetic reversal at the base of or progressively slightly lower below the member, a consistent paleocurrent direction shift of about 20 degrees, and the common first appearance of tubular vertical bioturbation at the base of the unit.","The Gabba Gabba Member is recognizable as far up the Murchison valley as Wonong Gully, about 20 km north of Kalbarri. It can be recognized in the coastal cliffs as far south as the cliffs are accessible (Shell House, about 10 km south of Kalbarri). It is below or at river level around Second Gully and Tumblagooda Hill.  It is consistently 1 to 2 m thick, with a possible maximum of about 3 m.","The member is named for Gabba Gabba Spring, at the mouth of Wittecarra Gully, south of Kalbarri. When named initially, Hocking (1991) referred to a Gabba Gabba Gully, but this is not shown on current topographic maps - only Gabba Gabba Spring appears, at the accepted site of the stranding of the &ldquo;Batavia&rdquo; mutineers. Note Gabba Gabba Hey is also the rally cry of the Ramones.  The type section is immediately in front of the main face of Red Bluff, just below the seaward edge of the highest major terrace level, at about MGA 218070E 6927800N.",,"The Gabba Gabba Member consists of a lower interval, 20 to 80cm thick, of very poorly sorted sandy pebble conglomerate to very pebbly sandstone, and an upper interval, about the same thickness, of granule conglomerate and scattered pebbles. Clasts are mostly quartz and chert, sub-angular to sub-rounded, set in coarse to very coarse-grained gritty quartz sandstone. The same lithofacies do not occur anywhere else in the FA3 sequence in the coastal or river gorges, although a similar pebbly interval is present in places about 3 m below the Member. Further north, at Bracken Point, the conglomerate is absent but sandstones coarsen abruptly at the same stratigraphic level. Most of the member is very small- to small-scale, trough cross-bedded (5-20 cm set thickness); the remainder is massive to poorly plane-bedded. The troughs indicate westward palaeocurrents, and there is a noticeable difference in directions between the pebble and granule layers. Pebbles are resistant rock types (mainly quartz), sub-angular to rounded, mostly 10 to 15 mm diameter but up to 30 mm diameter, and are supported in a coarse sand to granule matrix.  Poorly defined, 10 to 15 cm long, 1 to 2 cm diameter, vertical burrows occur in the facies south of Stone Wall and in the coastal gorges. They resemble  Skolithos  or  Cylindricum . The lowest appearance of stumpy cylindrical burrows like these is commonly within or just below the Gabba Gabba Member, although meandering mm- to cm-width trails are present at lower levels in medium- to very coarse-grained sandstone.   A paleomagnetic reversal coincides with the Gabba Gabba Member between Red Bluff and Grandstand Rock, a distance of about 8 km. Together with the lack of other discrete pebbly horizons, this confirms that it is a single, valid marker horizon in the coastal gorges. Between Thirindine Point and Stone Wall, the same magnetic reversal occurs in or just below the member (Schmidt and Hamilton, 1990; Schmidt and Embleton, 1990). This indicates that only a single stratigraphic unit is present, and that more erosion occurred below the horizon in the coastal cliffs than in the river gorge. ",The member is interpreted as a lag deposit developed on the surface of a major fan-shaped fluvial distributary system in a coastal setting as a probable result of autocyclic switching of major distributary fan systems.,,3,,"There may be a marked hiatus at the base, which is sharp, shows an abrupt paleocurrent direction from about 320 to 300 degrees, and a paleomagnetic reversal across it in sampled exposures in coastal cliffs and gorges (Hocking, 1991; Schmidt and Embleton, 1990; Schmidt and Hamilton, 1990), as well as commonly marking the first appearance of common vertical bioturbation.",,17,,,,5,,,,419.2,,393.3,,"It is inferred to be Early Devonian, based on presence of plant debris much lower in the type section.

It intrudes greenstones of the Melita Formation and the Mulliberry Granite (A-_ll-gm) to the east, and the Carpet Snake Syenogranite (A-_cs-gr) to the north.","The surface extent of the Galah Monzogranite pluton is about 9 kilometres north-south by 8 kilometres east-west. To the south of the Galah Rockhole, an intrusion within mafic schist (at Zone 51, MGA 332920E 6738400N) was interpreted by Witt (1994) to be part of the Galah Monzogranite. This smaller intrusion trends northwest, and is 4.6 kilometres long and up to 600 m wide. Xenoliths and roof pendants in outcrops south of Galah Rockhole (Zone 51, MGA 333457E 6741373N) suggest proximity to the roof of the intrusion (Witt, 1994).  The northerly trending Moriaty Shear Zone of Witt (1994) runs along the western margin of the Galah Monzogranite.","The Galah Monzogranite (Witt, 1994) is named after Galah Rockhole on MELITA (Zone 51, MGA 333457E 6741373E). This is the type locality and is in the southeastern part of the pluton.",,"The Galah Monzogranite is a cream to grey-pink, medium- to coarse-grained, biotite monzogranite that is seriate to weakly K-feldspar porphyritic (Dunphy et al., 2003). It is weakly deformed and partially recrystallized with numerous internal pegmatitic segregations. Secondary carbonate, epidote and fluorite are relatively common components (Witt, 1994).   Champion and Cassidy (2002) assigned the Galah Monzogranite to the low-Ca geochemical grouping of granitic rocks.",,,,,"Based on aeromagnetic data and mapping, Witt (1994) interpreted the Galah Monzogranite as intruding the Mount George Shear Zone and adjacent rocks. These rocks include undivided granites to the west, volcanic and volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Melita Formation (A-GIm-xfr-b) and the Mulliberry Granite (A-_ll-gm) to the east, and the Carpet Snake Syenogranite (A-_cs-gr) to the north. To the south, the Galah Monzogranite also intrudes mafic schist within undivided fine-grained mafic rocks (A-b-YEG), and part of its southern margin is in faulted contact with a northwesterly trending amphibolite (A-mwa-YEG).  Witt (1994) argued that the Galah Monzogranite truncates F 1  to F 3  fold axes of his interpreted deformation history for the MELITA area. The Galah Monzogranite and adjacent Carpet Snake Syenogranite post-date most, but not all, movement on the Mount George Shear and Moriaty Shear Zones of Witt (1994).

It is a locally restricted, lenticular conglomerate-sandstone-mudstone succession approximately 500 m thick that can be traced laterally for about 25 km from Gamminah Soak to 3 km south of Stewart Hill (MOUNT EVELINE). The conglomerate was formally described by Daniels et al. (1970) and Daniels (1974). The lower conglomeratic rocks of this succession were deposited in fluvial to fluvio-deltaic environments whereas the higher sandy and muddy rocks were deposited in a shallow marine or lacustrine water body. Basaltic lava flows and microbial laminites form minor but conspicuous lithologies within the Gamminah Conglomerate. Its contact to the overlying Frank Scott Formation is very gradational and conformable, whereas the contact to the underlying Miller Basalt may be erosional. The Gamminah Conglomerate was deposited between c. 1057 and 1030 Ma.","The Gamminah Conglomerate forms an east-trending, gently south-dipping (~25&deg;), lenticular stratigraphic unit that is sandwiched between the Miller Basalt and the Frank Scott Formation. Its occurrence is locally restricted to the area north of Frank Scott Hill in the southwestern part of the west Musgrave Province. Directly north of Frank Scott Hill it reaches its maximum thickness of about 500 m with an outcrop width of about 1300 m in a north-south direction. Laterally, it can be traced east-west for about 15 km, thinning out until eventually the Frank Scott Formation directly overlies the Miller Basalt.",The name Gamminah Conglomerate was first used by Daniels et al. (1970) and was most likely derived from Gamminah Soak on the Talbot 1:250 000 map sheet. The Gamminah Conglomerate was described but not defined by Daniels (1974). A type area is here designated as the 500 m thick section immediately north of Frank Scott Hill.,,"The Gamminah Conglomerate generally consists of a succession of conglomerates with a maximum thickness of about 200 m in its lower part and grades upward into an interbedded sandstone-mudstone succession with a maximum thickness of about 300 m forming the upper part of this stratigraphic unit. The conglomerates are poorly sorted and fairly coarse-grained with clast sizes reaching up to about 20 cm. They range from slightly matrix-supported to clast-supported. The conglomerates are composed of subangular to well-rounded clasts of massive or amygdaloidal basalts, aphyric to porphyritic rhyolites, milky vein quartz, and a matrix of medium- to coarse-grained sand. Crude planar stratification is the dominant sedimentary structure, although locally some minor cross-bedding is observed. The conglomerate succession is generally fining upward, although it contains internally coarsening-upward cycles in the order of a few metres. The conglomerates contain thin (2-15 cm), discontinuous interbeds of medium- to coarse-grained sandstone some of which show parallel lamination or ripple cross-stratification. Intercalations of dark bluish-grey laminated siltstones and greenish cherty mudstones are rarer. At one locality, an approximately 10-15 m thick basaltic lava horizon with amygdaloidal flow top was observed within the conglomerates and at another locality a thin autoclastic basalt breccia horizon was found. The conglomeratic succession in the lower part of the Gamminah Conglomerate is probably of fluvial to fluvio-deltaic origin.  The conglomeratic interval grades upward into an intermediate stratigraphic zone, about 5-20 m in thickness, composed of poorly-sorted, coarse-grained, pebbly sandstones and medium-grained, planar or trough cross-bedded sandstones. This is followed higher up by a succession of sandstone layers intercalated with siltstones, mudstones, and shales, up to 300 m thick . The sandstones are predominantly fine-grained rocks with a quartzitic appearance. They weather to reddish-brown colours from dark bluish-greenish-grey fresh surfaces, indicating the abundance of altered volcanic detritus in these rocks. The thickness of individual sandstone layers ranges from a few centimetres to about 2 m and characteristically show parallel to wavy lamination grading upward into ripple cross-lamination. Locally, tabular cross-bedding and low-angle swaley cross-bedding also occurs. The finer grained mudstones and shales are typically bluish-grey, whereas the siltstones are commonly more greenish. Some epidotitic mudstones with a cherty appearance are also present. Minor but conspicuous lithologies in the higher part of the Gamminah Conglomerate include olive-green to bluish-grey microbial laminites forming resistant, siliceous mudstone horizons. Near the top of the formation occurs a zone of thin (1-6 mm), whitish, cherty, partly fragmented mudstone bands intercalated in greyish mudstones. These whitish mudstones also occur as clasts in thicker (5-10 cm) edgewise conglomerates within sandstones.  ","The depositional environment of the quartzitic sandstone layers, intercalated in mudstones and shales, is interpreted as marine or lacustrine. They most probably represent tempestites and turbidites with their tops locally modified by wave or storm-current action. The shales and mudstones in which the sandstones are intercalated represent suspension settling of mud in an offshore, low-energy, subwave base setting within a large water body. ",,,,"The contact of the Gamminah Conglomerate with the underlying Miller Basalt is commonly fairly sharp. Locally the transition can take place over an interval of about 10-20 m consisting of a zone of interlayered basaltic lavas and conglomerate layers (Daniels, 1974). However, north of Frank Scott Hill, the Miller Basalt shows a reduced thickness of about 400 m, in contrast to about 700 m farther west on WARBURTON RANGE. This implies that the Gamminah Conglomerate may have developed in a bowl-shaped erosional body in the upper part of the Miller Basalt. Ongoing minor basaltic volcanism during deposition of the Gamminah Conglomerate is preserved as thin intercalated lava flows.  The boundary to the overlying Frank Scott Formation is very transitional. The base of the Frank Scott Formation is placed where the first limestone layer occurs above the Miller Basalt.  ",,17,,,,4,,,,1057,,1030,,"Constraints on the maximum depositional age of the Mission Group are derived from the crystallization age of the underlying Thomas Rhyolite of the Cassidy Group. A sample of the Thomas Rhyolite yielded an age of 1057 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 174691; Kirkland et al., 2012). However, it is likely that zircon crystals within this sample included a large number of antecrysts and that the quoted mean age should be regarded as a maximum age of rhyolite volcanism (Smithies et al., 2013). Constraints on the minimum depositional age of the Mission Group are from the 825-800 Ma depositional age for the Bitter Springs Formation (Maidment et al., 2007), which overlies equivalents of the Townsend Quartzite in the Amadeus Basin. However, the youngest crystallization age for rocks belonging to the Warakurna Supersuite, (which includes all magmatic rocks of the Bentley Supergroup, is c. 1030 Ma (e.g. e.g. Quentin de Gromard et al., 2017) and is likely a realistic minimum age constraint on deposition of the Gamminah Conglomerate.",No,,,4,,No,Submitted,No,No,P_,MIg,,,,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.01E+13,Yes,No

3347,32943,P_-BSg-kv,2968,Gillen Formation,1,"Dolomite dominant in outcrop, with evaporites present in subsurface; minor siltstone and sandstone","The Gillen Formation is the lowest of three formations of the Bitter Springs Group and is characterised by the presence of evaporites in the subsurface. The Bitter Springs Group is generally poorly exposed in Western Australia (WA), and recessive lithologies which are useful for distinguishing the formations of the group are generally not exposed. For this reason it is difficult to differentiate individual formations of the group with confidence unless diagnostic fossils (stromatolites, microfossils) are present. Thus the Gillen Formation, while identified at spot locations (e.g. at, and along strike from HJAPOL000018 [MGA Zone 52 349074E 7473151N] in the Pollock Hills where diagnostic stromatolite  Tungussia erecta  is present), is not differentiated from Bitter Springs Group on geological maps in WA. The formation is much better exposed in the Northern Territory (NT) where most outcrops are dominated by grey to buff-coloured dolomite, interbedded with minor grey-green siltstone, and sandstone. Evaporites, including halite, gypsum and anhydrite, are widespread in the subsurface based on drillhole intersections. The halite is always dissolved at surface, although gypsum may locally survive. Most outcrops throughout the basin are variably contorted and brecciated due to halotectonics and salt removal by dissolution. Halotectonics in the Gillen Formation plays a critical role in controlling deformation-style throughout the basin (Lindsay, 1987). The age of the Gillen Formation is not tightly constrained; from detrital zircon dating and other evidence outside of WA a broad Tonian age (c. 900-800 Ma) is applied.    ","The Gillen Formation is widespread in the Amadeus Basin, although not differentiated from other units of the Bitter Springs Group on maps in WA due to poor outcrop. Its presence in the WA Amadeus Basin is confirmed by the identification of the stromatolite  Tungussia erecta  in the Pollock Hills (HJAPOL000018; MGA Zone 52 349074E 7473151N) (Haines et al., 2010; Allen et al., 2012). The general halotectonic structural in WA implies that the Gillen Formation, with its salt unit, is widely present.",The is name Gillen Formation is derived from Mount Gillen about 6.5 km west of Alice Springs in the NT. The Gillen 'Member' of the then Bitter Springs 'Formation' was defined by Wells et al. (1967) with its type section in the low hills south of Mount Gillen where it is inferred to conformably overly the Heavitree Formation. The name was changed to Gillen Formation of the Bitter Springs Group by Normington et al. (2015).,,"The Gillen Formation is dominated by grey to buff-coloured dolomite in outcrop, with interbedded siltstone and fine-grained minor sandstone (mainly at the base). The dolomite may be locally stromatolitic and often displays chert laminae. Thick halite and sulphate evaporites have been intersected in the upper part of the formation in deep petroleum wells in the NT, but no halite is known in outcrop (Lindsay, 1987). Massive outcrops of gypsum occur locally in the NT, but have not been observed in WA. Outcrops are often contorted and brecciated due to salt movement (halotectonics) and later dissolution. The stromatolite  Tungussia erecta  (Walter, 1972) is considered a diagnostic marker of the Gillen Formation, but in WA has only been located in the Pollock Hills (POLLOCK 1:100 000 map sheet) (Allen et al., 2012).","The Gillen Formation was deposited under shallow marine conditions, which became very restricted during deposition of the upper part of the formation allowing for the development of thick evaporite deposits.",,,,"The Gillen Formation overlies the Heavitree Formation in the north, and the Dean Quartzite in the southwest part of the Amadeus Basin. Locally in the NT, it may unconformably overlie crystalline basement in the absence of the Heavitree/Dean unit, as in Mt Kitty 1 petroleum well. The contact with the Heavitree Formation and Dean Quartzite has been traditionally considered conformable and gradational (Wells et al., 1967; Edgoose, 2013), but is generally very poorly exposed. The contact with the overlying Loves Creek Formation is disconformable, to locally an angular unconformity (Edgoose, 2013).

The Gillen Formation is older than the Loves Creek Formation which has an inferred age of 810-790 Ma based on global chemostratigraphic correlations (Klaebe et al., 2017, and references therein).

The Gindalbie Group rocks were produced by volcanic centres at Melita, Teutonic Bore, Spring Well and Gindalbie. Other poorly documented volcanic successions at Spider Well and Garden Well are also provisionally assigned to this group. Gindalbie Group rocks are mapped from north of Spring Well on DARLOT to south of Gindalbie on GINDALBIE. The rocks around Gindalbie are similar in facies, geochemistry and age to the northern formations of this group.

The Teutonic Bore Formation of the Gindalbie Group hosts economic volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) Zn-Cu-Ag-Pb-Au mineralization at Teutonic Bore (Zone 51, MGA 318560E 6856090N) and Jaguar-Bentley (Zone 51, MGA 319320E 6852130N).","Gindalbie Group rocks outcrop from north of Spring Well on DARLOT to south of the historical Gindalbie townsite on GINDALBIE in a north-northwesterly trending belt that is about 320 km long. They are mapped on MELITA, LEONORA, YERILLA, WEEBO, DARLOT, BOYCE, and GINDALBIE.   Most outcrops of the Melita Formation ( Melita Complex  of Barley et al. (2002);  Melita Rhyolite  and  Jeedamya Rhyolite  of Witt (1994)) are on MELITA, but the formation extends north onto LEONORA, east onto YERILLA, and southeast onto BOYCE. The Teutonic Bore Formation is mapped on LEONORA and WEEBO. Because of the poor exposure and consequent lack of detailed volcanic facies information, the boundary between the Melita and Teutonic Bore Formations is not well defined. The Spring Well Formation is mostly on DARLOT but extends into the northern part of WEEBO. As yet unassigned rocks of the Gindalbie Group extend south onto GINDALBIE.  The Gindalbie Group is bounded to the west by a series of faults and shear zones that include the Ockerburry and Perseverance Faults, and the Mount George Shear Zone. The known eastern extent is marked by the Keith Kilkenny Fault in the south and granite intrusions in the north. The maximum and minimum thicknesses of the group are not known.  Published  terrane-based  divisions of the eastern Yilgarn Craton have assigned the area covered by the Gindalbie Group to the  Gindalbie Terrane  of Barley et al. (2008) and the  Gindalbie Domain  of Cassidy et al. (2006). However, Cassidy et al. (2006) included the Spring Well Formation (A-GIs-f) in their Murrin Domain. Rocks previously included in the  Jeedamya Rhyolite  or  Jeedamya Formation  (Barley et al. (2002) and Witt (1994)), respectively, are here assigned to the Melita Formation of the Gindalbie Group.","The Gindalbie Group takes its name from the historic township of Gindalbie (Zone 51, MGA 379467E 6643972N).",,"The formations of the Gindalbie Group differ geochemically but the volcanic facies within each are similar. Rocks of the Melita and Teutonic Bore Formations are HFSE (high field strength element) enriched, whereas the rocks of the Spring Well Formation and at Jeedamya are calk-alkaline. A brief description of each formation and other outcrop areas is given here. For more details, refer to the explanatory notes entries for the individual formations. All rocks have undergone at least low-grade metamorphism.  There is little published information about the volcanic rocks from the Spider Well and Garden Well areas on WEEBO, which may represent a southern extension of the Spring Well Formation, or those from the vicinity of the historic Gindalbie township locality on GINDALBIE.   Spring Well Formation (A-GIs-f)  The Spring Well Formation includes calc-alkaline basaltic andesite, andesite and dacite-rhyolite lavas; associated breccias; abundant microdioritic sills and dykes; subordinate volcanogenic conglomerate, sandstone and shale; and lamprophyre dykes (Giles, 1982; Barley et al., 2008). Extrusive and intrusive products of similar compositions are interpreted as co-genetic, and the geochemistry of the Spring Well andesites resembles that of modern subduction-related andesites (Barley et al., 2008).   Teutonic Bore Formation (A-GIt-xfr-b)  The Teutonic Bore Formation contains andesite, pillowed basalt, volcaniclastic rocks, porphyritic rhyolite, and dolerite sills (Hallberg and Thompson, 1985; Barley et al., 2008; Belford et al., 2015). Teutonic Bore rhyolitic rocks are geochemically similar to Melita Formation rhyolites and are spatially associated with high-level intrusions of syenogranite and alkali-feldspar granite with similar geochemistry to the Teutonic Bore rhyolites (Barley et al., 2008).   Melita Formation (A-GIm-xfr-b) <u> </u>The rock types of the Melita Formation include tholeiitic basalt and basaltic andesite lavas, pillowed basalt, mafic hyaloclasite, porphyritic rhyolite, rhyolite breccia, felsic and mafic volcanogenic sandstone, chert, and dolerite and gabbro sills (Barley et al., 2002, 2008). The Jeedamya rhyolites are interpreted as representing a more distal volcanic association compared with the Melita rhyolites (Witt, 1994).  The mafic rocks of the Melita Formation are interpreted as tholeiitic. Rhyolites in the Melita and Jeedamya areas are high-silica rhyolites. The rocks in these two areas have fundamentally similar REE (rare earth element) patterns but different REE contents (Morris, 1998). Jeedamya rhyolite samples are relatively more HREE (heavy rare earth element) depleted than Melita rhyolites. Some HFSE-enriched granite and porphyritic microgranite that are spatially associated with the Gindalbie Group &mdash; for example the Dairy Monzogranite (A-_dm-gmb), which intrudes the Melita Formation &mdash; have been interpreted as coeval plutons (Hallberg, 1985; Champion and Sheraton, 1997).   Kents Bore Basalt (A-GIk-bb)  The Kents Bore Basalt is an aphyric to porphyritic, high-Fe tholeiitic basalt that overlies the the Melita and Teutonic Bore Formations on LEONORA and is in turn overlain by the Little Peters Formation.   Little Peters Formation (A-GIl-f)  The Little Peters Formation is composed of rhyolitic to dacitic felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks interbedded with sandstone and shale. It overlies the Kents Bore Basalt and is tectonically juxtaposed with mafic and ultramafic rocks of the Marshall Pool Subgroup and sedimentary rocks of the Mount Leonora Formation.   Garden Well (WEEBO: Zone 51, MGA 317040E 6867860N <u>) </u>Rocks in the Garden Well area include porphyritic rhyolite (Stewart, 2004), alkali-feldspar granite, diorite and gabbro (Barley et al., 2008). They are interpreted as a series of subvolcanic igneous intrusions, with fine-grained and granophyric phases interpreted as indicating shallow emplacement (Barley et al., 2002, 2008).   Spider Well (WEEBO: Zone 51, MGA 310140E 6880560N)  Rocks in this area include porphyritic rhyolite and medium-grained granitic rocks (Barley et al., 2008). These are interpreted as subvolcanic intrusions with finer grained rocks and granophyric phases representing shallow sills and possible extrusive equivalents (Barley et al., 2008).   Gindalbie (GINDALBIE: Zone 51, MGA 379440E 6643860N)  Rocks in the southern part of the Gindalbie Group include weathered and schistose basaltic, intermediate and felsic volcanic rocks, and polymictic conglomerate containing basalt and porphyritic microgranite clasts (Barley et al., 2008).","Barley et al. (2008) interpreted Gindalbie Group rocks as primarily subaqueously erupted and/or subaqueously deposited volcanic products, suggesting subaqueous to emergent conditions during volcanism. A convergent margin environment with rifting related to initiation of back-arc spreading has been proposed as the depositional environment for the Gindalbie Group, based on the chemistry and volcanology of Gindalbie Group rocks (Brown et al., 2002; Barley et al., 1998, 2002, 2008). The depositional environments for each formation of the Gindalbie Group are interpreted as equivalents to modern intra-arc and rifted arc environments (Barley et al., 2008).The rocks of the Gindalbie Group become distinctly bimodal south of Spring Well (basalt and high-silica rhyolite), interpreted as indicating greater extension in the arc environment towards the south (Barley et al., 2008).  An alternative hypothesis, proposed by Barnes and Van Kranendonk (2014), is that rocks of the Gindalbie Group are products of plume-crust interaction.",,,,"The Gindalbie Group is bounded to the west by a number of faults and shear zones including the Ockerburry and Perseverance Faults, and the Mount George Shear Zone. The known eastern extent is marked by the Keith Kilkenny Fault in the south and granite intrusions in the north. The group appears to be interleaved with rocks belonging to older and younger successions but poor outcrop makes it difficult to determine contact relationships in many places.  The Gindalbie Group is overlain locally by clastic sedimentary rocks belonging to the  late-basin  sedimentary successions of Barley et al. (2002), such as the Yandal Sandstone (A-_ya-s).",,17,,,Mixed,2,,,,2694,4,2676,4,"The proposed age range for the Gindalbie Group is 2694-2676 Ma (Kositcin et al., 2008). However, the southern extent of formations belonging to this group is not well understood due to poor exposure, lack of detailed facies mapping, and sparse geochronological data. There appears to be some interleaving of Gindalbie Group rocks with older and younger successions. Listed below are representative age determinations from various components of the area assigned to the  Gindalbie Terrane  of Barley et al. (2002, 2008).    Spring Well Formation         2690 Â± 6 Ma for a rhyolitic subvolcanic sill or lava (GSWA 118953, Nelson, 1997a; Zone 51, MGA 318437E 6912558N)   2694 Â± 4 Ma for a porphyritic rhyolite (E225, Barley et al., 2002; Kositcin et al., 2008; Zone 51, MGA 318245E 6912790N)   2702 Â± 5 Ma for an altered porphyritic rhyolite in the Darlot mine sequence (GSWA 142821, Nelson, 1997b; Zone 51, MGA 330004E 6913767N), 11 km east of Spring Well. This age may represent the age of the volcanic succession that underlies the Spring Well Formation.    <div style=""margin-left: 40px Samples constraining the minimum age of the Spring Well Formation include:</div>        2680 Â± 6 Ma for quartzofeldspathic sandstone of the Yandal Sandstone (A-_ya-s), probably derived from granite (E229, Barley et al., 2002; Kositcin et al., 2008; Zone 51, MGA 322405E 6941809N)   2666 Â± Ma for a porphyritic andesite dyke intruding intermediate volcaniclastic rocks at Spring Well (E227, Barley et al., 2002; Kositcin et al., 2008; Zone 51, MGA 319756E 6913854N). These dykes are geochemically similar to volcanic rocks of the Black Flag Group in the Kalgoorlie area rather than to the older rocks at Spring Well.     Teutonic Bore Formation          2692 Â± 4 for a porphyritic dacite in the Teutonic Bore mine host sequence (GSWA 112159, Nelson 1995a; Zone 51, MGA 318337E 6854358N).

Southern area of the Gindalbie Group         2709 Â± 4 Ma for a dacite breccia from Wild Dog Dam (GSWA 104970, Nelson, 1995b; Zone 51, MGA 386766E 6655447N)   2680 Â± 4 Ma for a fine-grained tuff intraclast from Wild Dog Dam (E349, Barley et al., 2002; Kositcin et al., 2008; Zone 51, MGA 386781E 6655445N)   2681 Â± 5 Ma for dacitic volcanic rock near Maggies Dam (GSWA 104979, Nelson 1995c; Zone 51, 389036E 6640457N)   2676 Â± 4 Ma for a volcanogenic sandstone near Maggies Dam (E350, Barley et al., 2002; Kositcin et al., 2008; MGA 391713E 6642173N).

1485,7321,A-_al-xb-o,1,Glasse Formation,1,Mafic volcanic rocks with subordinate mafic intrusive rocks; metamorphosed,The Glasse Formation is the uppermost named formation in the Lake Johnston greenstone belt in the southeastern part of the Youanmi Terrane of Yilgarn Craton. It is composed of metamorphosed mafic volcanic rocks with subordinate mafic intrusive rocks. Metamorphic grade ranges from greenschist to amphibolite facies.,"The Glasse Formation is exposed along the central western limb of the Lake Johnston greenstone belt on the LAKE JOHNSTON 1:250 000 map sheet. Mount Glasse (Zone 51, MGA 288325E 6393872N on TAY) and Burmiester Hill (Zone 51, MGA 281012E 6401240N on TAY) are formed by mafic extrusive rocks of the Glasse Formation. The formation is at least 800 m thick but due to folding and duplication of stratigraphy, it is up to 1800 m wide. Extensive shearing and volume reduction during metamorphism make the original stratigraphic thickness of the package hard to estimate. The formation can be traced continuously along the strike of the greenstone belt for about 20 km in outcrop and then farther north from Mount Glasse, in a northwesterly direction, on aeromagnetic images. Altogether, the Glasse Formation is interpreted to continue for up to 55 km to Round Top Hill at its northern end (Zone 51, MGA 259573E 6438339N; ROUNDTOP).","The Glasse Formation is named after Mount Glasse (Zone 51, MGA 288325E 6393872N) in the northwestern part of TAY. The formation was first described by Gower and Bunting (1972).  The type section for the Glasse Formation is across Mount Glasse. Here the succession forms an F 2  (local structural scheme) fold with a north-northwesterly trending fold axis and a regional-scale fold closure at Mount Glasse. The succession is about 1.6 km wide, but faultbound to the east. The stratigraphically lowest part of the Glasse Formation is exposed on the western flank of Mount Glasse (SSRTAY000140, Zone 51, MGA 287383E 6394025N) where there are fine- to medium-grained amphibolites present in the outcrop. Higher up in the stratigraphy, pillow structures in metabasalt can be observed in a rubbly outcrop (SSRTAY000166, Zone 51, MGA 288266E 6393924N) towards the centre of the fold. Gower and Bunting (1972) determined younging in pillows on the eastern limb of the fold to indicate younging towards the northwest, implying a synform.",,"The Glasse Formation is composed of a homogeneous tholeiitic mafic volcanic succession with subordinate mafic intrusive rocks that have undergone greenschist to amphibolite facies metamorphism. The overall weathering style of the Glasse Formation is more angular and homogeneous when compared with the Maggie Hays Formation in the lower part of the stratigraphy. The dominant rock type is fine-grained to aphyric metabasalt with subordinate, thin, amygdaloidal horizons. Amygdales are typically less than 1 cm in diameter and elongate due to deformation (aspect ratio ranges from 2:1 to 4:1). They are aligned parallel to the main foliation plane. Sparse pillow structures can be observed at the peak of Mount Glasse. Mafic intrusive rocks form thin sills. The sills may belong to the Lake Medcalf Igneous Complex but there are no geochronological or geochemical data to support this interpretation.",,1800,,,"The Glasse Formation is the uppermost named formation of the Lake Johnston greenstone belt. It is underlain by the Roundtop Komatiite, possibly intruded by the Lake Medcalf Igneous Complex (A-_lm-og), and is in contact with undivided mafic schist and amphibolite. Contacts, where exposed, are typically sheared.",,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,2920,,2718,,"The Glasse Formation has not been dated directly and age constraints for the formation have thus been derived from its relationship with other units in the Lake Johnston greenstone belt. The Roundtop Komatiite (A-_rt-xuk-bk) lies stratigraphically above, and locally intrudes, the Honman Formation (A-_hm-c). Unassigned felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks (A-fd-YYO; A-xmfs-mhs-YYO) that lie structurally below the Honman Formation have a range of ages between c. 2920 and 2725 Ma, including a date at c. 2876 Ma (Wang et al., 1996; Romano et al., 2014; GSWA 207516, preliminary data). A younger limit for the age of the Roundtop Komatiite (and thus the Glasse Formation) is provided by a cross-cutting monzogranite intrusion dated at c. 2718 Ma (Romano et al. 2014).  While it is possible that the Honman Formation and overlying formations, including the Roundtop Komatiite and Glasse Formation, are all younger than c. 2725 Ma (the age of the youngest felsic unit dated from near Round Top Hill), it would require that the entire package were deposited in a very short period of time, considering that the Roundtop Komatiite is intruded by granitic rocks at c. 2718 Ma. Therefore, a more conservative estimate for the maximum age of the Glasse Formation is considered to be c. 2920 Ma or possibly the c. 2876 Ma, the age of probably underlying felsic volcanic units (Romano et al., 2014). These constraints are consistent with ages of similar formations elsewhere in the Youanmi Terrane (Van Kranendonk et al., 2013).",No,,,92,,No,Published,No,No,A,_al,,26,33,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,No,No

Thus, a date of 1065 Â± 9 Ma (GSWA 195230, GSWA, preliminary data) obtained directly from a sample of the Mount Waugh Formation possibly represents the maximum age constraint on the deposition of rocks of the Pussy Cat Group. The upper contact of the Pussy Cat Group with the overlying Wururu Rhyolite of the Cassidy Group is conformable. A date of 1065 Â± 5 Ma (GSWA 174690, Kirkland et al., 2011a) obtained directly from a sample of the Wururu Rhyolite possibly represents the minimum age constraint on the deposition of rocks of the Pussy Cat Group. Where the Kathleen Ignimbrite is not in intrusive contact with the feldspar-porphyritic rhyolite, these contacts with volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks are locally peperitic, indicating that the entire depositional sequence was essentially synchronous. However, although a 1062 Â± 8 Ma date (GSWA 195001, GSWA, preliminary data) obtained from feldspar-porphyritic rhyolite underlying the Kathleen Ignimbrite is consistent with the minimum and maximum age bracket of the Pussy Cat Group, older dates from the ignimbrite (1071 Â± 5 Ma, GSWA 195723, Kirkland et al., 2011b) and from feldspar-porphyritic rhyolite that overlies it (1076 Â± 5 Ma, GSWA 195031, GSWA, preliminary data; 1078 Â± 5 Ma, GSWA 195058, GSWA, preliminary data) are at the older extreme of, or exceed, that age bracket. This highlights a problem common to dating of all igneous rocks of the Talbot Sub-basin.  It is likely that the dates from these rocks represent the mean age of zircon crystallization, including that of locally abundant antecrysts, but not the age of magmatic crystallization of those rocks. Rather, crystal-laden (including zircon) magma resided in a near-solidus state in subvolcanic chambers for several millions of years (from c. 1075 Ma) before it was remobilized and erupted (Kathleen Ignimbrite) or intruded (feldspar-porphyritic rhyolite). Evidence for this is found in the textures of the zircon crystals, which show complex magmatic zoning, dissolution and regrowth patterns from magmas with very different Th and U concentrations. It is now recognized that all felsic igneous rocks of the Talbot Sub-basin include a large proportion of recycled cognate material (i.e. antecrysts). The unavoidable inclusion of these in the dated zircon samples means that all previously interpreted crystallization ages have likely been variably overestimated (i.e. true ages of volcanic deposition or intrusive crystallization should be younger).  Smithies et al. (2013) suggested that the most conservative age range for magmatic activity within the Talbot Sub-basin is probably between c. 1077 and c. 1047 Ma although dating of individual zircons interpreted to be antecrysts indicates a maximum possible range from 1116 Â± 28 to 1010 Â± 20 Ma.",No,,,4,,No,Published,No,No,P_,PUg,,,,,MIGSDAR,2.01E+13,2.01E+13,No,No

The Complex consists of about 9000 km&sup3; of mafic-ultramafic plutonic rocks tilted approximately 70&deg; to the south-southeast. Lithologically, it is formed principally of dolerite, gabbro, wehrlite, and olivine-chromite cumulate rocks. The lower portion of mafic-ultramafic cumulates is unexposed but is interpreted to form a tilted, conical-shaped layered intrusion, which is host to Cr-Ni-PGE mineralization. The middle portion of the complex consists primarily of gabbro and is approximately one kilometer thick and widens from 15 km to 22 km base-to-top. The upper portion of dolerite and minor gabbro is a well-exposed series of stacked sills >2 km in total thickness and its longest strike length is about 80 km. These sills are an average of 300 m thick and intrude into banded iron formation and minor volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Wilgie Mia Formation (Van Kranendonk et al., 2013) and they contain large kilometre-scale rafts of host rocks. The age of the complex is interpreted to be c. 2792 Ma given current age constraints.","The Gnanagooragoo Igneous Complex outcrops primarily on the southern half of MADOONGAas a four kilometre wide belt, parallel to ridges of the east-northeast trending Weld Range. It extends to the southeast of MADOONGA into small regions of CUE, NOONDI and KALLI. The outcrop of the complex is 8 km wide (across strike) in its central region, where it has a lower portion of layered mafic-ultramafic rocks. The layered rocks form a triangular outcrop, widening to approximately 22 km diameter at its top and it is likely that in 3D this is conical in form. The outcrop narrows to 4 km across-strike width along the rest of the Weld Range (representing the dolerites), which has a maximum strike length of 80 km, and it tapers to < 1 km width as granites impinge upon its eastern contact in the northern part of the outcrops on MADOONGA. Metamorphosed mafic rocks of the complex are found as sheared lenses in northern MADOONGA and as rafts within granites.","The Gnanagooragoo Igneous Complex is named after Gnanagooragoo Peak (Zone 50, MGA 571000E 7025000N) on the south part of MADOONGA. Previously, the triangular, layered lower part of the Gnanagooragoo Igneous Complex was referred to informally as the 'Range Bore intrusion' (Bunting pers. comm.) and the 'Weld Range complex' (Parks, 1998). The upper parts of the complex were previously referred to as the 'Weld Range dolerites' (Bunting pers. comm.). The middle zone was previously referred to as the 'Main Zone' (Ivanic et al. 2010).",,"The Gnanagooragoo Igneous Complex includes distinct lower, middle and upper parts (after Ivanic et al., 2010). The entire complex has been tilted so that it now dips approximately 70&deg; to the south-southeast. The unexposed lower part of layered ultramafic rocks have been described in detail during mineral exploration drilling programs (e.g. Parks, 1998). This is probably conical in form and may have a vertical thickness of up to 6 km. According to drillhole data, Parks (1998) describe the lower part of the lower unit as composed of olivine-chromite mesocumulates with subordinate, interstitial pyroxenes and plagioclase. In the upper part of this unit, wehrlitic cumulates dominate with minor clinopyroxenite, local chromite-rich rocks, pegmatitic phases and minor hornblende-bearing rocks. Grain size is typically 1-8 mm and locally coarser grained. These units below the gabbroic part of the complex also contain minor sulfides (up to 5%) and trace quantities of platinum group minerals (PGM), a possible &ldquo;reef&rdquo;, which have been the focus of exploration targets (Parks, 1998) and with a Pt grade estimated at 1 ppm. The lower part of the complex is overlain in the most part by lateritic duricrust.  In the poorly exposed, ~1 km thick, middle portion of the complex, massive gabbroic rocks dominate and these typically have 4 mm grain size. Examples of weakly-developed, cyclical modal igneous layering from melanocratic gabbro to leucogabbro are present, locally with harrisitic top contacts (e.g. at site TJIMDG000684, Zone 50, MGA 568864E 7027046N). In the gabbroic rocks, cumulate crystals are locally aligned, producing an igneous lamination texture, which is parallel to large-scale igneous layering.  The upper portion of the complex is well exposed, >2 km thick and consists of stacked sills with a 2-7 mm grain size (i.e. varying between dolerite and gabbro). At site TJIMDG000244 (Zone 50, MGA 566810E 7020661N) there is an outcrop of a gabbroic layer within dolerite. This gabbroic layer has 15 mm pyroxene cumulate crystals in a matrix of 3-4 mm sized clinopyroxene and plagioclase crystals. Close to host banded iron formation units, the dolerite is typically finer-grained (approximately 1 mm grain size) in chilled contact zones.",,2000,6000,,"At its base, the complex intrudes into c. 2979 Ma volcano-sedimentary rocks (e.g. GSWA 193972; Wingate et al., 2012a). The lowermost dolerites intrude into c. 2870 Ma banded iron formations (During et al., in prep) and the overlying dolerites intrude into c. 2792 Ma metasiltstones (GSWA 155568 Ma; Wingate et al., 2013). The upper contact of the complex is overlain by c. 2728 Ma felsic metavolcanic rocks of the Ryansville Formation (GSWA 197420 Wingate et al., 2014). Dolerites of the complex are crosscut by a Cullculli Suite intrusive unit dated at c. 2741 Ma (GSWA 185926 Wingate et al., 2011).",,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,2792,11,2792,11,"Direct dating of a zirconium-rich dolerite yielded an age of 2805 Â± 19, which was interpreted to represent a xenocrystic age population (GSWA 194757; Wingate et al., 2012).

A conservative age bracket for the age of magmatic crystallization of the dolerites of the Gnanagooragoo Igneous Complex is between 2741 Ma (the age of a crosscutting microgranite; GSWA 185926, Wingate et al., 2011) and 2792 Ma (the age of a metasiltstone intruded by dolerite of the complex; GSWA 155568, Wingate et al., 2013). Given the age limits for the remainder of the Warriedar Suite are between 2792 Ma and 2801 Ma, it is deemed likely that the age of the complex narrowly postdates and is within error of the age of the metasiltstone GSWA 155568, i.e. 2792 Â± 11 Ma.",No,,,10,,No,Submitted,Yes,No,A,ANgn,,,,,MIGSDTI,2.02E+13,,No,No

It is the major host for gold mineralization in the Mount Charlotte and Fimiston or Golden Mile deposits near the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder. Travis et al. (1971) subdivided the dolerite into ten units based on textural and mineralogical characteristics. From the basal chilled margin there is a broad change from cumulate ultramafic to gabbro-dolerite. A quartz-rich granophyric unit in the top third of the sill is the most important host for gold mineralization within the formation. The dolerite has been documented around the Boomerang Anticline with considerable thickness variation, ranging from 200 m on the eastern limb to 700 m on the western limb. The dolerite can be up to 850 m thick and has strike length of the about 17-18 km.","The dolerite is located on the eastern margin of the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder in the Kalgoorlie Terrane. It is structurally associated with the Boomerang and Kalgoorlie Anticlines and has intruded above the Paringa Basalt. It has a strike length of ~17-18 km and variable thickness from <200m to 940m. The dolerite is located at the border between the KALGOORLIE and KANOWNA map sheets.   Across the Kalgoorlie Anticline the dolerite displays a considerable variation in thickness. On the eastern limb of the upright north north-easterly trending limb the thickness is 200m, and there is a gradual fractionation trend without development of magmatic layering. The western limb has a much greater thickness of 700m, and is has been suggest that the Golden Pike Fault structurally controlled the emplacement of the dolerite (Neumayr et al., 2004).","The term &ldquo;Golden Mile Dolerite&rdquo; was first used by Woodall (1965). The name was adopted from the Golden Mile area (which is now the Superpit), which was historically referred to as the richest square mile in the world due to the gold content. The location name &ldquo;Golden Mile&rdquo; was first used in scientific publication in 1906 by Lindgren in his paper titled &ldquo;Metasomatic processes in the gold deposits of Western Australia&rdquo;. The term was in use locally, in newspapers and other ephemeral literature, well before this date (D. Nixon, 2013, written comm., 11 October).",,"The GMD is a differentiated, tholeiitic sill regionally concordant to stratigraphy, but locally discordant to the host mafic and ultramafic host rocks of the Kalgoorlie Group. Travis et al. (1971) provided what is now regarded as a classic subdivision of the sill into 10 units on the basis of mineralogical (type and abundance), Fe- -Ti oxide mode and morphology (particularly leucoxene), and primary igneous textural variations. Broadly there is a decrease in pyroxene content up section as ilmenite (Â± magnetite) and plagioclase contents increase. Primary quartz is found throughout, except near the base, and is most common in the granophyric zone located approximately a third from the upper margin.   A summary of the units described by Travis et al. (1971) and Bateman et al., (2001) is provided below:        UNITS 1 and 10 &mdash; are the basal and upper chilled margins, respectively. The average thickness is 1-12 metres and has a variolitic texture. Fine- to medium-grained leucoxene is uniformly distributed.   UNIT 2 &mdash; transitional with Unit 1 to a coarse cumulate textured pyroxenite 30-60 metre thick. Actinolite has pseudomorphed clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene. Leucoxene is sparse with a skeletal habit and primary quartz is absent. Nickel content is highest in this unit.   UNIT 3 &mdash; transitional with Unit 2 to a medium-grained two pyroxene-plagioclase cumulate-textured gabbro of ~ 40m thick. Leucoxene is sparse with a skeletal habit.   UNIT 4 &mdash; transitional with Unit 3, and has an increased abundance of plagioclase. The unit is a 90 metre thick medium-grained subophitic gabbro. Leucoxene has a glomeroporphritic texture.   UNIT 5 &mdash; transitional with Unit 4. Composed of plagioclase-clinopyroxene-orthopyroxene-Fe-Ti oxides with a distinctive ophitic texture. Less than 100m thick.   UNIT 6 &mdash; Contact with unit 5 is marked by appearance of ubiquitous fine- to medium-grained magnetite and ilmenite. Composition and thickness is similar to Unit 5. Weakly granophyric. Rich in V, Cr, Ni and Cu.   UNIT 7 &mdash; 100-200 metre thick dolerite (two pyroxene-plagioclase-magnetite-ilmenite) with thin layers (5cm-100cm) with a weak granophyric and coarser texture.   UNIT 8 &mdash; 100-200 metre thick strongly granophyric zone, which is characteristically associated with Charlotte-style mineralization. Quartz content may be as high as 20%. Magnetite is abundant and fine-grained, and leucoxene is medium grained and granular.   UNIT 9 &mdash; 100-350 m thick . Characterized by skeletal leucoxene transitional to skeletal ilmenite at the base. This unit reflects the changes of Units 2 to 7 in reverse order, with a grain size variation of medium to fine-grained towards the chilled margin of Unit 10.    A greenschist facies assemblage consisting of actinolite-albite-chlorite-epidote-zoisite-quartz is the dominant premineralization characteristic (Travis et al., 1971). Widespread carbonate metasomatism has overprinted the original mineralogy, but textures are often preserved. Three different styles of mineralization are reported in the immediate Kalgoorlie area and Superpit region. These styles are, from oldest to youngest, the Fimiston, Oroya and Charlotte lodes. The lodes are structurally controlled, and all have an association with the Golden Mile Dolerite, particularly Unit 8 (Travis et al., 1971; Bateman &amp; Hagemann, 2004; Weinberg et al., 2005; Evans et al., 2006; Bateman, 2010). Alteration assemblages associated with mineralisation within the dolerite vary from early-stage gold-pyrite, to telluride-rich and telluride-poor zones depending upon the age and timing of movement on the adjacent structure (Bateman &amp; Hageman, 2004; Mueller &amp; Muhling, 2013).",,200,850,,Intrusive relationship.

It has only been recognized on the EDMUND and WINNING POOL 1:250 000 map sheets, the western part of KENNETH RANGE and in drillholes at the Abra polymetallic deposit on western CALYIE. Significant thicknesses of sandstone (P_-MEg-st) have been mapped as a separate member on ULLAWARRA and CAPRICORN. The Gooragoora Formation is up to 250 m thick and has a sharp conformable contact with the underlying Irregully Formation. It has a conformable upper contact with siltstones and mudstones of the Blue Billy Formation, except on ULLAWARRA and CALYIE where it is disconformably overlain by the Kiangi Creek Formation. The Gooragoora Formation is thought to have been deposited in a deltaic to shallow-marine shelf environment, at a time when the Edmund Basin experienced a rise in relative sea level and drowning of the Pingandy Shelf. In contrast to the underlying Irregully Formation, basement structures such as the Talga Fault had little influence on Gooragoora Formation sedimentation. The age of the Gooragoora Formation is poorly known, but was probably deposited between c. 1673 and 1610 Ma.","The Gooragoora Formation has been mainly recognized in the northwestern part of the Edmund Basin where it forms a persistent mappable unit on the EDMUND and WINNING POOL 1:250 000 map sheets. The thickest sections are about 250 m thick and are located on central ULLAWARRA. The Formation thins towards the southeast and pinches out beneath the Blue Billy Formation on northeastern ELLIOTT CREEK and western KENNETH RANGE. In contrast to the underlying Irregully Formation, the Gooragoora Formation does not show any marked thickness variation between the Talga Fault and Mangaroon Syncline.  The Gooragoora Formation is also recorded in drillholes at the Abra polymetallic deposit on western CALYIE. Here the formation comprises about 40-50 m of mineralized conglomerate and sandstone; however, these rocks are truncated by the disconformity at the base of the Kiangi Creek Formation and are not exposed in outcrop.","The Gooragoora Formation (Martin et al. 1999; Martin and Thorne 2002) was originally established as the Gooragoora Sandstone Member of the Irregully Formation by Daniels (1970). This unit was excluded from the Irregully Formation and named Gooragoora Sandstone by Chuck (1984), who recognized it as being more lithologically varied and paleoenvironmentally distinct from the Irregully Formation. This usage was adopted by Martin et al. (1999), who renamed these rocks the Gooragoora Formation to take into account the observed lithological variation, and also by Martin and Thorne (2002) who formally described these rocks.  The origin of the name 'Gooragoora' was not specified by Daniels (1970). However, it was probably derived from Gooragoora Pool (Zone 50, MGA 382670E 7468620N), on Wannery Creek in the southwestern corner of the WYLOO 1:250 000 map sheet.  A suitable type section for the Gooragoora Formation is yet to be defined. No type area or section was defined for the former Gooragoora Sandstone Member by Daniels (1970), but these are most likely to be located near Gooragoora Pool. Chuck (1984) proposed a type area about 2 km north of Old Ullawarra Well on ULLAWARRA, but did not define a type section. Martin and Thorne (2002) measured an incomplete representative section through the upper part of the Gooragoora Formation, 6.5 km southeast of Old Ullawarra Well (Zone 50, MGA 422100E 7426100N). Excellent exposures of the formation are present in the Barley Range Nature Reserve on a tributary of Wongida Creek (Zone 50, MGA 396800E 7441600N) 10 km west of Murgundarra Pool on MAROONAH.",,"The Gooragoora Formation is composed of fine- to very coarse-grained quartz sandstone, feldspathic sandstone and siltstone, together with minor conglomerate. Dolostone and dolomitic siltstone are also present locally in upper parts of the stratigraphy. Significant thicknesses of sandstone that are present in upper parts of the succession on ULLAWARRA and CAPRICORN have been mapped as a separate member (P_-MEg-st). Outcrops of the Gooragoora Formation are often covered by a silcrete caprock and may also be strongly ferruginous. Cubic molds and anhedral aggregates of oxidized pyrite are present in the area around Irregully Gorge (Zone 50, MGA 447100E 7413200N).   Fine-grained sandstone is mostly thin to medium bedded and has a tabular to lenticular geometry. They generally display parallel-planar lamination, undulatory lamination, or ripple cross-lamination. Medium- to very coarse-grained sandstones are thinly to very thickly bedded with a tabular to lenticular geometry. Some beds are massive, whereas others are normally graded and display solitary or stacked sets of medium- to large-scale cross-stratification. Parallel-planar and low-angle stratification is also present in some medium- to very coarse-grained sandstone beds and current ripples or flute casts are observed on some upper and lower bedding surfaces. In rare cases the primary sedimentary structures have been disrupted by sediment dewatering. Thin layers of mudstone-intraclast pebble conglomerate appear interbedded with some coarse- to very coarse-grained sandstones. Paleocurrents taken from medium- to large-scale trough cross-stratification in sandstone units are predominantly towards the south (Martin et al., 2008). Similar data taken from small-scale cross-stratification in fine-grained sandstones are more variable with additional paleoflow components towards the northeast and northwest.  Siltstone and dolomitic siltstone are most abundant in the lower part of the Gooragoora Formation and generally form poorly exposed recessive outcrops. Their internal structure is dominated by parallel-planar lamination, parallel-undulatory lamination, or ripple cross-lamination. Conglomerate is best developed in drillholes at the Abra polymetallic deposit (Zone 50, MGA 660600E 7273400N), on western CALYIE. It consists of poorly sorted, clast- or matrix-supported, granule- to pebble-conglomerate, interbedded with variable amounts of coarse-grained sandstone. Clasts in the conglomerate are angular to subrounded and generally consist of vein quartz, jaspillite, and siltstone. The conglomerate matrix is composed mostly of fine- to coarse-grained sandstone. Dolostone units are generally recrystallized and form thinly to very thickly bedded units with a tabular to irregular lenticular geometry.  A representative sample of the Gooragoora Formation was taken from a thick, cross-stratified, medium-grained quartz sandstone bed 1.8 km north-northwest of Carnoby Well (Zone 50, MGA 400418E 7383044N) on EDMUND. Wingate et al. (GSWA 148970, 2007) describe this sample as quartz-rich sandstone that contains irregular lenses rich in limonite or hematite. It is dominated (80-85%) by deformed single-crystal quartz grains up to 0.8 mm in diameter and 5-10% interstitial, fine-grained quartz that has been recrystallised. Minor constituents include colloform-banded kaolinite (10%) in limonite-free areas, colloform-banded limonite or sparse limonite-rimmed voids (5%), and kaolinite in limonite-rich areas (5%). The clay patches are mostly about 1 mm in diameter, and the limonite patches are up to 2 mm long. The single-crystal quartz grains have undulose extinction and sutured grain boundaries. No heavy minerals were observed and the limonite may have replaced carbonate minerals. The kaolinite may represent former feldspar grains although there is no obvious textural preservation.","The Gooragoora Formation is thought to have been deposited in a fluvio-deltaic to shallow-marine shelf environment at a time when the Edmund Basin experienced a rise in relative sea-level and drowning of the Pingandy Shelf (Martin and Thorne, 2004). These events resulted in deposition of planar laminated, undulatory laminated, and ripple cross-laminated siltstones that generally mark the base of the Gooragoora Formation. Most fine- to medium-grained sandstones were probably laid down in a near-shore, delta front to shallow-marine setting. Lenticular to tabular beds of coarse- to very coarse grained quartz sandstone are interpreted as distal distributary channel deposits, whereas minor interbedded carbonates were probably laid down in coastal to shallow marine environments during short-lived periods of low siliciclastic sediment input. Laterally restricted conglomeratic deposits at the Abra polymetallic deposit in the southeastern part of the basin are interpreted as more proximal fluvial deposits, possibly derived from an upland area associated with the Quartzite Well - Bujundunna Fault system.  The cause of the rise in sea level, whether it was tectonically or eustatically controlled, is unknown. In contrast to the underlying Irregully Formation, thickness, facies, and paleocurrent trends in the Gooragoora Formation indicate that basement structures such as the Talga Fault had little influence on sedimentation at this time. Coarse-grained deltaic sedimentation in the Gooragoora Formation was best developed in the northwestern parts of the Edmund Basin. Here, the progradation of deltaic sandstones during a period of high or rising sea level suggests that uplift to the northwest exceeded the rate of sea-level rise. To this effect, the southeasterly thinning of the Gooragoora Formation probably reflects the extent of delta progradation rather than any subsequent erosion. ",250,,,"The Gooragoora Formation has a sharp, conformable lower contact with dolostones of the Irregully Formation, although the boundary is often not well exposed. Chuck (1984) has reported the presence of a slight angular unconformity with the Irregully Formation, northeast of the type area on ULLAWARRA. The Gooragoora Formation generally has a sharp, conformable upper contact with siltstones and mudstones of the Blue Billy Formation. Exceptions to this are on central ULLAWARRA and at the Abra polymetallic deposit on CALYIE, where it is disconformably overlain by sandstone and conglomerate belonging to the Kiangi Creek Formation.",,17,,,,4,,,,1673,,1610,,"The age of the Gooragoora Formation is poorly known, but it was probably deposited between c. 1673 and 1610 Ma, an age range based on geochronology data from underlying and overlying units within the Capricorn Orogen. Ages given by the youngest groups of detrital zircons in sandstone units present within the Gooragoora Formation are maximum values only, and are at least 50 Ma older than the likely older age limit for deposition of the formation.  The maximum age of the Gooragoora Formation is constrained by its stratigraphic position, in which it directly overlies the Irregully Formation in Depositional package 1 of the Edmund Group. The older age limit for Depositional package 1 is provided by the c. 1673 Ma maximum age of the Yilgatherra Formation (P_-MEy-st). Depositional package 1 overlies granitic rocks of the 1680-1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite in the Gascoyne Province (Sheppard et al., 2010). The Discretion Granite on MARQUIS is the youngest granite in the Durlacher Supersuite and has been dated at 1619 Â± 15 Ma (GSWA 142855, Nelson, 1998; Sheppard et al., 2010). However, the boundary between the Discretion Granite and Depositional package 1 is faulted and the true nature of the contact, whether it is intrusive or unconformable, cannot be determined.  The minimum age for the Gooragoora Formation is given by the U-Pb age of hydrothermal xenotime of 1610 Â± 16 Ma for the earliest phase of mineralization in the Gooragoora Formation and underlying Irregully Formation host rocks at the Abra polymetallic deposit (Zi et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2015). Mineralization and hydrothermal fluid flow, in the same part of the stratigraphy, continued until at least 1590 Â± 9 Ma (Zi et al., 2015). Both periods of mineralization pre-date the Waldburg Dolerite that intrudes underlying and overlying parts of the Edmund Group. Wingate et al. (GSWA 206916, 2015a) determined an age of 1517 Â± 8 Ma from a sill of Waldburg Dolerite, intruded into the Kiangi Creek Formation on southeastern MOUNT AUGUSTUS. Another sill, intruded along the disconformable contact between the Irregully and Kiangi Creek Formations on MOUNT AUGUSTUS, yielded an age of 1513 Â± 5 Ma (GSWA 206991, Wingate et al., 2015b). Sills of the Narimbunna Dolerite, which intrude overlying units of the Edmund Group are younger than the Waldburg Dolerite and have been dated at c. 1465 Ma by Wingate (2002).  Minimum ages of detrital zircons extracted from the Gooragoora Formation generally reflect the ages of the local Capricorn Orogen basement. The youngest group of detrital zircons in a sample collected from a sandstone outcropping near Carnoby Well (Zone 50, MGA 400408E 7383044N) on EDMUND has been dated at 1749 Â± 9 Ma (GSWA 148970, Wingate et al., 2007). Martin et al. (2008) determined a maximum depositional age of 1733 Â± 12 Ma from the same data. The youngest group of detrital zircons in sample GSWA 148970 is most likely to have been derived from the Ashburton Formation and Moorarie Supersuite, with older modes being derived from the Archean to Paleoproterozoic supracrustal successions on the southern margin of the Pilbara Craton (Martin et al., 2008). However, there may have been some contribution to these modes through minor reworking of Depositional package 1 of the Edmund Group.",No,,,3,,No,Published,No,No,P_,MEg,,,,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

The sill is located to the east of Coolgardie on the KALGOORLIE Map sheet and is folded around the Barbara Anticline. The age of the sill is unknown.,"The gabbro extends from the Greenfields opencut, located 4 km to the northeast of the Coolgardie Township. It continues in an east-southeasterly direction for 7 km before being folded around the nose the Barbara Anticline. On the southern limb of the anticline the gabbro thins rapidly and only extends for 3 km. The gabbro has been emplaced between the Gleesons Komatiitic Basalt and metasedimentary rocks of the Black Flag Group.","Possibly named after the Greenfields pit and underground (Zone 51, MGA, 328141E, 6576483N).",,"The best exposure of the gabbro is in the Greenfields pit. From exploration of the pit exposure Keele and Shelton (1990) recorded four distinct zones within the differentiated Gabbro and a chilled margin. From the chilled margin to the interior these four zones are:  1. Cumulate textured gabbro beneath the chilled margin. Comprises secondary actinolite and interstitial plagioclase (Zone 6 of Keele and Shelton, 1990) 2. Subophitic medium-grained gabbro with phenocrysts of plagioclase (max. 5mm length), within a felsic matrix of feldspar-quartz-ilmenite. Hornblende is the dominant amphibole (Zone 5 of Keele and Shelton, 1990) 3. Felsic matrix comprising quartz-feldspar supporting 8mm long laths of plagioclase and up to 100m long acicular, randomly orientated hornblende (Zone 4 of Keele and Shelton, 1990).  4. Cumulate textured gabbro. Local contains millimetre-sized phenocrysts of sub-rounded blue coloured quartz. Dominant minerals are subhedral plagioclase and dark blue-green hornblende (Zone 3 of Keele and Shelton, 1990).   The metamorphic grade is amphibolite facies, and within the Greenfields pit there are multiple alteration styles which include carbonate alteration, saussuritization to sulphidization (Keele &amp; Shelton, 1990). Quartz veins with in the gabbro comprise pyrite-arsenopyrite-chlorite and gold. The auriferous veins are predominantly confined to Zone 4 of Keele and Shelton (1990). Geochemical data is sparse on the gabbro however, Standing (2001) suggests the Greenfields Gabbro is unlikely to be genetically related to the economically important Three Mile Dolerite. The Greenfields Gabbro has minimal response in total magnetic imagery, unlike many of the mafic intrusive mafic rocks in the region.

The acicular amphibole ranges in size from a few millimetres up to 15mm, and has a pseudospinifex-like texture. Growth of an iron-rich, rather than magnesium-rich amphibole, and the lack of cumulate textures or the diagnostic downward-coarsening spinifex texture indicates that this rock is not a komatiite. Plagioclase and quartz are characteristic interstitial mineral phases with subordinate opaque minerals. Locally, small vesicles (2-4mm diameter) are found within finer-grained basaltic flows.

Despite the metamorphism, original igneous components can be recognized in areas of low strain. Igneous crystallization ages for the granitic protoliths range between c. 2555 and 2441 Ma.  The Halfway Gneiss comprises interlayered leucocratic granitic gneiss and foliated leucocratic granite, mesocratic granitic gneiss, pale-grey granitic gneiss, gneissic to foliated porphyritic granodiorite, foliated granite, and pegmatite. There are no sharp boundaries between the various rock types as they are interleaved at both mesoscopic and megascopic scales. Two mappable units are recognized within the Halfway Gneiss: leucocratic granitic gneiss and foliated granite (AP_-_ha-mgnl), and mesocratic granitic gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgnw).","The Halfway Gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgn, AP_-_ha-mgnl, and AP_-_ha-mgnw) comprises much of the basement to the Glenburgh Terrane on the northern parts of GLENBURGH, LANDOR, and DAURIE CREEK, and the southern and central parts of MOUNT SANDIMAN, LYONS RIVER, LOCKIER, YINNETHARRA, PINK HILLS, and CANDOLLE.  Undivided Halfway Gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgn) forms a 50 km long, 25 km wide belt that straddles the southern parts of LYONS RIVER, LOCKIER, and YINNETHARRA, and northern parts of DAURIE CREEK and GLENBURGH, forming the core of a regional-scale (25 km wavelength) tight to isoclinal, steep, southeast-plunging fold. Two outcrops lie on the northern side of the Ti Tree Shear Zone. One is a 14 km long outcrop on northern PINK HILLS and the other is an isolated inlier on southern CANDOLLE.  Mesocratic gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgnw) comprises a significant but dispersed component of the Halfway Gneiss where it forms numerous disparate, outcrop-scale irregularly shaped bodies. However, the mesocratic gneiss does also form more coherent, discretely mappable units. On GLENBURGH and DAURIE CREEK, mesocratic gneiss forms an elongate 1 km wide, 8 km long body along the southern margin of the leucocratic gneiss. Farther north on LOCKIER and YINNETHARRA, mesocratic gneiss forms a 5 km wide, 50 km long southeast-trending belt that defines the northern limb of the regional-scale fold. On the southern part of MOUNT SANDIMAN, mesocratic gneiss forms a small 3 km-long raft within younger granitic gneisses of the Durlacher Supersuite. On the southwestern corner of YINNETHARRA and southern part of PINK HILLS, the unit forms an irregularly shaped outcrop covering approximately 13 km 2 . To the west, the mesocratic unit is found on both sides of the Ti Tree Shear Zone. On the southern side, the mesocratic gneiss forms a 5 km-wide outcrop around the Injinu Hills (PINK HILLS). On the northern side of the Ti Tree Shear Zone on PINK HILLS and CANDOLLE, the mesocratic gneiss forms a significant 25 km by 15 km outcrop that is intercalated with massive quartzite of the Moogie Metamorphics and is intruded by various granitic bodies of the Moorarie Supersuite. On CANDOLLE the mesocratic gneiss forms rafts of elongate material within these younger granitic bodies.  The leucocratic gneiss is present throughout all parts of the Halfway Gneiss, but generally forms disparate outcrop-scale units. Continuous  mappable  outcrops of leucocratic gneiss are found on GLENBURGH and DAURIE CREEK,where it forms a 6 km-wide, east-west trending linear belt that defines the southern limb of the regional-scale isoclinal fold. The same unit is folded around the southeast trending regional-scale fold hinge where it transects YINNETHARRA and LOCKIER as a northwest-southeast trending belt some 7 km wide. On the southern part of MOUNT SANDIMAN, leucocratic gneiss occurs as a 9 km-wide outcrop, and also as a <2 km-wide, 5 km-long belt on the northern part of LYONS RIVER; both exposures occur within younger rocks of the Durlacher Supersuite.","The Halfway Gneiss is named after Halfway Bore on northwestern GLENBURGH (Zone 50, MGA 414500E, 7231240N).",,"The Halfway Gneiss comprises interlayered leucocratic granitic gneiss and foliated leucocratic granite, mesocratic granitic gneiss, pale-grey granitic gneiss and foliated granite, gneissic to foliated porphyritic granodiorite, and pegmatite. There are no sharp boundaries between the various rock types as they are interleaved at both mesoscopic and megascopic scales. Contacts between the various rock types are typically tectonic, although in places igneous intrusive relationships between individual granitic protoliths are preserved. Two mappable units are recognized within the Halfway Gneiss: leucocratic granitic gneiss and foliated granite (AP_-_ha-mgnl), and mesocratic granitic gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgnw). Mapped boundaries of the leucocratic and mesocratic gneisses define areas of dominance of one gneiss type over the others. In areas where neither mesocratic nor leucocratic gneiss dominate, the gneiss is mapped as undivided Halfway Gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgn); however, within AP_-_ha-mgn there are discrete units of pale-grey granitic gneiss that are not present within either the leucocratic or mesocratic portions. The leucocratic and mesocratic components of the Halfway Gneiss are described in the relevant rock units (AP_-_ha-mgnl and AP_-_ha-mgnw).  Pale-grey granitic gneiss and foliated granite is abundant south and southeast of Dunnawah Well, and consists of plagioclase, quartz, biotite, K-feldspar, and epidote, with accessory zircon and titanite. Biotite constitutes about 10% of the rocks. Zircon is commonly euhedral and zoned. The rock is typically fine- to medium-grained, and weakly to moderately pegmatite banded. In lower strain domains, it consists of medium-grained, equigranular or weakly porphyritic biotite metagranodiorite and quartz-rich leucocratic metatonalite, and can be difficult to distinguish from medium-grained biotite(-muscovite) granite (P_-MO-gmeb) of the Moorarie Supersuite. The gneissic layering is defined by biotite- or epidote-rich layers, alternating with quartz- and feldspar-rich layers. Plagioclase commonly forms large porphyroclasts (up to 7 mm diameter) enclosed by mica or quartz. In a few layers, quartz grains are flattened and display undulose extinction, whereas in other layers quartz grains are largely polygonal, exhibiting triple junctions. Biotite, commonly with zircon inclusions, defines the foliation and a mineral lineation, and may be completely pseudomorphed by pale-green chlorite. Fine-grained sericite and epidote variably replace plagioclase and K-feldspar.",,,,,"The Halfway Gneiss is tectonically interleaved with calc-silicate gneiss, amphibolite, actinolite schist, tremolite schist, and pelitic schist of the Moogie Metamorphics. The original relationship between these supracrustal rocks and the Halfway Gneiss is unknown, although the ages of detrital zircons from several psammitic and pelitic schists, and quartzites, from the Mumba Psammite (Johnson et al., 2010) indicate that they were derived from the Halfway Gneiss by erosion sometime after c. 2250 Ma. A rare series of outcrops on the southern part of YINNETHARRA (e.g. SPJYIN000220; Zone 50, MGA 412464E 7240270N) demonstrate that psammitic schists of the Moogie Metamorphics (P_-MGm-mtsf) have near-horizontal bedding planes that are sub-parallel to the schist contact with the underlying mesocratic gneiss, possibly representing a paleo-unconformity. The relationships with the structurally overlying Leake Spring Metamorphics are unclear, and are everywhere in apparent faulted contact. Low-grade metasandstone and metaconglomerate of the Mount James Subgroup (Biddenew Formation) are mainly in faulted contact with the Halfway Gneiss, but presumably these metasedimentary rocks were originally unconformable on the gneiss as reflected by the large 2500-2450 Ma detrital zircon components in the uppermost marine psammites of the Spring Camp Formation (e.g. GSWA 185953 and 185954). Surprisingly, the lowermost Mount James Subgroup metaconglomerates do not contain clasts derived from the Halfway Gneiss, nor the underlying Glenburgh Terrane. Based on regional scale map patterns along the southern margin of PINK HILLS and northernmost part of LANDOR, the lowermost unit of the Mesoproterozoic Edmund Group, the Yilgatherra Formation, must unconformably overlie the Halfway Gneiss.  The Halfway Gneiss is extensively intruded by sheets and dykes of the Dumbie Granodiorite (P_-MOdu-ggp), plutons, dykes, and veins of the Scrubber Granite (P_-MOsc-gm), and numerous plutons from both the Moorarie and Durlacher Supersuites. The age of c. 2005 Ma (Nelson, 2001a) obtained from the youngest phase of the Halfway Gneiss indicates that leucocratic igneous material from the Dalgaringa Supersuite forms a volumetrically minor part of the gneiss.  
On LOCKIER, LYONS RIVER, and MOUNT SANDIMAN, the Halfway Gneiss occurs mainly in contact with, or entirely surrounded by, porphyritic granitic rocks and gneisses of the younger Durlacher Supersuite. Intrusive contacts are rare and, since most of the Durlacher Supersuite granitic rocks in this area are strongly deformed, the contacts are interpreted to be tectonic.",,17,,,,4,,,,2555,4,2441,,"Seven samples of Halfway Gneiss have been dated using SHRIMP U-Pb zircon methods; six of these were dated by GSWA, and the remaining sample was dated by Kinny et al. (2004). Three of the dated samples were from undivided Halfway Gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgn; GSWA 164309, GSWA 168950, NP21), two were from leucocratic gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgnl; GSWA 185955, GSWA 168947), and two were from mesocratic gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgnw; GSWA 142988, GSWA 188973). Five of the samples indicated Neoarchean crystallization ages for the precursor granites, one yielded an early Paleoproterozoic age, and the remaining sample has a crystallization age indistinguishable from those of granitic rocks of the Paleoproterozoic Dalgaringa Supersuite.  A pale-grey augen gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgn) derived from biotite granodiorite was collected about 1 km southeast of Middle Well (Zone 50, MGA 413616E 7225303N; GSWA 164309) on northern GLENBURGH. This sample yielded a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 2555 Â± 4 Ma (Johnson et al., 2011; recalculated from the original data of Nelson, 2000b), interpreted as the crystallization age of the granodiorite precursor. Two zircon xenocrysts gave dates of c. 2673 and c. 2605 Ma. A sample (Zone 50, MGA 360390E 7165760N) of pegmatite-banded tonalitic gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgn) from the Carrandibby Inlier on CARRANDIBBY (GSWA 168950) yielded a complex array of concordant to slightly discordant analyses. Four analyses provide a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 2518 Â± 2 Ma (Johnson et al 2011; recalculated from the original data of Nelson, 2001b) and is interpreted to reflect crystallization age of the gneiss; older dates are interpreted to be of xenocrystic zircons, and younger dates to reflect ancient Pb loss, most likely at c. 1900 Ma (Nelson, 2001b; Johnson et al., 2011). A sample (NP21) from the same gneiss unit (AP_-_ha-mgn) was also dated at 2508 Â± 5 Ma by Kinny et al. (2004). However, one analysis of a low-Th/U zircon overgrowth indicated a date of c. 2390 Ma, suggesting that this gneiss was metamorphosed at this time (Kinny et al,. 2004), or it may date the timing of intrusion of thin leucocratic veins into the gneiss (Johnson et al., 2011).  A sample of medium-grained leucocratic gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgnl; Zone 50, MGA 428780E 7244930N) was collected about 350 m south of a disused beryl mine on southeast YINNETHARRA (GSWA 185955). The gneiss yielded many zircons, most of which contained high common-Pb contents. Several age components were dated between c. 2835 and c. 2340 Ma. Seven of these analyses yielded a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 2527 Â± 9 Ma, and two indicated dates of c. 2350 Ma (Wingate et al., 2010). It is possible that the c. 2530 Ma date represents crystallization of the monzogranitic precursor to the gneiss, whereas the younger dates represent younger age components of the gneiss such as thin leucocratic veins. However, the gneiss protoliths could be as young as c. 2350 Ma.  In addition to the Neoarchean ages determined for the Halfway Gneiss, Nelson (2001a) dated a leucocratic granitic gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgnl) derived from biotite monzogranite on DAURIE CREEK (Zone 50, MGA 381950E 7230840N; GSWA 168947). The igneous crystallization age of the precursor granite to the gneiss was defined as 2006 Â± 6 Ma (Nelson, 2001a). This result suggests that the Halfway Gneiss contains some elements of the Dalgaringa Supersuite.  Nelson (2000a) also dated the tonalitic component of a mesocratic, banded granitic gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgnw) immediately west of Dunnawah Well on northwestern GLENBURGH (GSWA 142988). This sample contains several concordant zircon age components, but the population dated at 2552 Â± 4 Ma (Johnson et al., 2011; recalculated from the original data by Nelson 2000a), are interpreted to date the timing of crystallization of the granitic precursor to the gneiss. Older xenocrystic populations of zircon were dated at 3447-2615 Ma (Johnson et al., 2011).  A single sample of mesocratic gneiss was dated from the Limejuice Zone on central, southern PINK HILLS (GSWA 188973). This granodioritic gneiss yielded numerous zircons of magmatic origin, the majority of which yielded a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 2441 Â± 6 Ma, interpreted as the crystallization age of the gneiss protolith (Wingate et al., in prep.).",No,,,36,,No,Published,Yes,Yes,AP_,_ha,,13,35,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

A petrographic sample of metabasalt from the eastern limb of the Mount White Syncline near the synclinal hinge (GSWA 40329, in Lewis, 1975) mainly comprises actinolite and plagioclase with minor opaques and granular sphene. Relict texture consisting of small plagioclase laths (about 0.22 mm long) and feathery pyroxene are well preserved.

157,27793,P_-HC-xmd-mb,1,Halls Creek Group,1,Pelitic and psammitic metasedimentary rocks with basaltic and andesitic to trachytic metavolcanic and metavolcaniclastic rock,"The Halls Creek Group is the major component of the Eastern Zone of the Lamboo Province and records terrestrial to deep-marine sedimentation and volcanism on the western margin of the North Australian Craton from c. 1904 Ma to 1834 Ma. In ascending order, the group consists of the Saunders Creek, Brim Rockhole, Biscay, and Olympio Formations. The Saunders Creek Formation consists of immature, cross-bedded metasandstone and metaconglomerate deposited in a high-current energy fluvial system. The conformably to gradationally overlying Brim Rockhole Formation contains fine-grained, siliciclastic metasedimentary rocks overlain by calcareous and dolomitic metasedimentary rocks, both deposited in quiescent shallow-marine or lacustrine settings. The Brim Rockhole Formation contains bimodal metavolcanic rocks, including a felsic metavolcanic rock dated at c. 1881 Ma, which is interpreted as the age of volcanism. A low-angle unconformity separates the Brim Rockhole Formation from the overlying Biscay Formation. The Biscay Formation is a shallow-marine, volcano-sedimentary succession deposited from c. 1881 to 1861 Ma. The formation consists of metasedimentary rocks intercalated with metamorphosed basalt and basaltic andesite lava. The Olympio Formation disconformably to unconformably overlies the Biscay Formation and represents basin-wide subsidence and marine transgression of the western margin of the North Australian Craton. The Olympio Formation is interpreted to consist of a series of submarine fan lobes deposited from turbidity currents on a continental shelf or slope off the North Australian Craton from c. 1856 to 1834 Ma. The Olympio Formation contains two members of meta-andesitic to metatrachytic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, representing submarine volcanism: the c. 1856 Ma Maude Headley Member and the c. 1846 Ma Butchers Gully Member. Amphibolite sills of the c. 1835 Ma Woodward Dolerite intrude all formations in the Halls Creek Group.","The Halls Creek Group is exposed in a >270 km long north-northeasterly trending belt in the east Kimberley region and roughly parallels the Great Northern Highway. The southernmost extent of the group crops out north of the Cummins Range (BANNERMAN Zone 52, MGA 299718E 7874297N) and extends north-northeasterly through the McClintock Range (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 323993E 7915980N), Woodward Range (RUBY PLAINS, Zone 52, MGA 349982E 7944995N), Old Halls Creek (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 371095E 7981880N), Bay of Biscay Hills (DIXON, Zone 52, MGA 398113E 8028183N), and as far north as Mount Ranford (TURKEY CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 413986E 8068112N). Individual formations of the Halls Creek Group are not evenly distributed throughout this range. For example, the stratigraphically lower units, i.e. the Saunders Creek and Brim Rockhole Formations, have a restricted outcrop around basement structural domes. East of Sophie Downs Homestead (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 374524E 7988000N), the Saunders Creek and Brim Rockhole Formations crop out around the Sophie Downs Dome, Brim Anticline, Saunders Creek Dome, and the Castle Creek Anticline, which are cored by the 1912-1904 Ma Sophie Downs Suite. In the Taylor Lookout area (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 321759E 7909295N), the Saunders Creek and Brim Rockhole Formations also crop out around anticlinal cores and small structural domes cored by the Sophie Downs Suite.  The Biscay Formation also crops out around the various basement inliers cored by the Sophie Downs Suite and the lower units of the Halls Creek Group. However, the unit is also exposed farther south between Old Halls Creek, Ruby Plains Homestead (RUBY PLAINS, Zone 52, MGA 356622E 7943485N), and the Woodward Range (RUBY PLAINS, Zone 52, MGA 349982E 7944995N) where the formation has a significant exposure west of the north-northeasterly trending Halls Creek Fault. The youngest formation, the Olympio Formation, is exposed throughout the >270 km length of the group from north of Cummins Range in the south to just north of Mount Ranford in the north. The Olympio Formation is the most aerially and volumetrically extensive unit in the Halls Creek Group.","The Halls Creek Group is named after the town of Halls Creek (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 359347E 7983425N) in the east Kimberley region. The group was first defined by Matheson and Guppy (1949) for rocks previously included in the  Mosquito Creek Series  by Matheson and Teichert (1946). Type areas of the Halls Creek Group are located around basement inliers, such as the Sophie Downs Dome, Brim Anticline, Saunders Creek Dome, and Castle Creek Anticline east of Sophie Downs Homestead (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 374524E 7988000N) and along the Duncan and Tanami Roads.  Dow et al. (1964) described the Halls Creek Group with seven formations, which in ascending order were the Ding Dong Downs Formation, Saunders Creek Formation, Woodward Formation, Biscay Formation, Olympio Creek Formation, Koongie Formation, and Moola Bulla Formation. The Ding Dong Downs Formation, subsequently renamed the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (Dow and Gemuts, 1969), was found to be significantly older than the rest of the group and was incorporated into the underlying basement rocks of the 1912-1904 Ma Sophie Downs Suite (Griffin and Tyler, 1993). The Koongie Formation and Moola Bulla Formation were later found to be younger than the underlying rocks, so were also removed from the Halls Creek Group (Gellatly et al., 1965; Roberts et al., 1968). The Woodward Formation (Dow et al., 1964) was defined as calc-silicate rocks, quartz-muscovite and graphitic schists, and minor amphibolite north of the Sophie Downs Dome. Gellatly et al. (1965) later incorporated these rocks into the Biscay Formation and discarded the Woodward Formation. Phillips et al. (2016) proposed that these rocks were older than the Biscay Formation based on SHRIMP U-Pb zircon geochronology and structural relationships and were redefined as the Brim Rockhole Formation. The Olympio Creek Formation Ruker (1961) was renamed the Olympio Formation (Dow and Gemuts, 1964; Gellatly et al., 1965). ",,"Matheson and Guppy (1949) defined the Halls Creek Group as consisting dominantly of metasedimentary rocks with minor metavolcanic rocks, regionally folded and intruded by pegmatite dykes, quartz veins, dolerite sills, and minor granite. The entire group has been metamorphosed to lower greenschist facies, locally upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies. The Halls Creek Group consists of four formations, which in ascending order are the Saunders Creek Formation, Brim Rockhole Formation, Biscay Formation, and Olympio Formation.  The Saunders Creek Formation is composed of greenschist facies siliciclastic metasedimentary rocks, including immature metasandstone and metaconglomerate. Metasandstone beds are thick-bedded and poorly sorted. Medium- to coarse-grained metasubarkose, meta-arkose, and quartzite are common. Sedimentary structures include abundant trough cross-bedding, planar cross-bedding, planar laminations, overturned cross-bedding, and rare normal grading. Metasandstone beds are commonly interbedded with thin-bedded to medium-bedded, matrix-supported, quartz pebble- and granule-metaconglomerate. Metaconglomerate commonly eroded into metasandstone beds to form discontinuous beds, lenses, and lags. On the western flank of the Saunders Creek Dome (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 385749E 7994829N), the Saunders Creek Formation fines upward to thin- to medium-bedded, laminated or cleaved, siliceous metasiltstone interbedded with medium- to coarse-grained erosive quartz metasandstone beds.  The Brim Rockhole Formation contains siliciclastic and carbonate metasedimentary rocks and intercalated bimodal metavolcanic rocks. On the eastern flank of the Sophie Downs Dome, the Brim Rockhole Formation unconformably overlies basement rocks of the Sophie Downs Granite (CXPGRD000017, HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 377728E 7988327N). Here, the Brim Rockhole Formation consists of laminated quartzite, metamorphosed sublitharkose and mica-graphite-quartz schists. Intercalated mafic metavolcanic rocks consist of massive to amygdaloidal basalt and basaltic andesite and lesser volcaniclastic rocks. Calcareous and dolomitic metasedimentary rocks conformably overlie siliciclastic rocks north of the Sophie Downs Dome. Metacarbonate lithologies include calcareous and dolomitic metasandstone and metasiltstone, calc-silicate and carbonate schists, and subordinate marble. Interbedded fine-grained quartz sandstone beds are commonly boundinaged. Northwest of the Sophie Downs Dome, a thin northeast-striking unit consists of intercalated felsic metavolcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, felsic tuffs, metarhyolite, calcareous and metasedimentary rocks, and lesser basalt. Pelitic schists of the Biscay Formation overlie carbonate schists of the Brim Rockhole Formation along a low-angle unconformity.  The Biscay Formation consists of quartzofeldspathic and lithic metasandstone, metasiltstone, psammitic and pelitic schists, mafic tuffs, and volcaniclastic rocks intercalated with abundant metabasalt and minor metadolerite. Subordinate lithologies include felsic schists, carbonaceous rocks (possibly volcaniclastic), and metachert. Metasandstone beds are commonly well sorted, massive, and siliceous with faint planar laminations and cross-laminations composed of ferruginous siltstone. Metasiltstone clasts <1 mm wide are common. Pyroxene and biotite are altered to actinolite and chlorite. Volcaniclastic rocks are black, very well sorted, and friable with areas that appear pumiceous. Pseudomorphs of feldspar and possibly pyrite associated with black, graphitic shale laminations. Intercalated volcanic rocks are dominantly greenschist facies metabasalt. Metabasalt beds are massive with amygdales near flow tops. Metabasalt beds near Ruby Plains Homestead are dominantly massive with ridges of metabasalt 250-500 m thick.  The Olympio Formation consists of thick-bedded, immature metasandstone and interbedded metasiltstone disconformably or unconformably overlying the Biscay Formation. The formation is > 4000 m thick, consisting of turbidite metasandstone beds with a sheet-like geometry dominated by medium- to thick-bedded, moderately sorted, fine- to medium-grained subarkose and feldspathic litharenite. Clasts of massive or laminated siliceous metasiltstone up to 10 cm across indicate amalgamation surfaces between turbidite beds (e.g. CXPGRD000230, HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 377274E 7963141N). Beds are commonly massive with rare normal grading in coarser grained lithofacies. Rare coarser lithofacies consist of coarse-grained, poorly sorted subarkose with lags of matrix-supported, quartz-granule conglomerate. Interbedded packages of metasiltstone are planar laminated or massive and strongly cleaved and slate is common. The Olympio Formation contains two members composed of metavolcanic rocks, representing intercalated deep-marine volcanism interbedded. The Maude Headley Member is found 50-100 m above the base of the Olympio Formation and is composed of meta-andesitic and metatrachytic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks with metacarbonate breccia beds dated at 1856 Â± 6 Ma. The Butchers Gully Member is a similar volcanic and volcaniclastic package of meta-andesite and metatrachyte dated at 1846 Â± 4 Ma, but separated from the older Maude Headley Member by up to 1 km of turbidite sedimentation.","The Halls Creek Group records terrestrial to deep-marine sedimentation and volcanism on the northwest margin of the North Australian Craton from c. 1881 to 1834 Ma. The Saunders Creek Formation (P_-HCs-xmt-mx) consists of coarse-grained and immature lithofacies with abundant trough cross-bedding, heavy-mineral laminations, and overturned cross-bedding, which together indicate deposition a high-current energy braided river system. Basement topography exerted a strong control during deposition of the fluvial system as evidenced by variable thickness in the Saunders Creek Formation around the flanks of basement inliers made of the Sophie Downs Suite. On the eastern flank of the Sophie Downs Dome, the Saunders Creek Formation pinches out and the overlying Brim Rockhole Formation (P_-HCb-xmkt-mv) is in unconformable contact with basement rocks (Phillips et al., 2016).  The base of the Brim Rockhole Formation consists of micaceous, ferruginous, and graphitic schists (P_-HCb-mhs). These lithofacies are indicative of deposition in dysoxic or anoxic, quiescent, and current-restricted environments (Reinhard et al., 2013; Phillips et al., 2016). Laminated, fine-grained calcareous and dolomitic metasedimentary units in Brim Rockhole Formation (P_-HCb-mk) also suggest a quiescent depositional setting. There is no evidence for evaporitic textures or minerals to infer subaerial exposure and units were probably deposited above fair-weather wave base in a shallow-marine or possibly lacustrine setting (Phillips et al., 2016). Intercalated bimodal volcanism in the Brim Rockhole Formation (P_-HCb-mbb and P_-HCb-mf) constrains the age of volcanism and coeval sedimentation to c. 1881 Ma (Blake et al., 1999; Phillips et al., 2016).  Biscay Formation metasandstone and metasiltstone units (P_-HCr-mh) have a planar geometry or gently pinch and swell along strike and were probably deposited in a tidally influenced shallow-marine setting. Higher current energy episodes produced erosive contacts and rare coarse-grained beds, possibly tempestite facies. Immature and lithic metasandstone indicate sourcing from a proximal continental province and partial derivation from the concomitant mafic volcanism. Basaltic metavolcanic and metavolcaniclastic rocks (P_-HCr-mbb) in the Biscay Formation consists of metabasalt lava with subordinate meta-andesite lava and associated metavolcaniclastic rocks. Local pillow lavas indicate some of the volcanism was subaqueous.  The Olympio Formation (P_-HCo-xmt-ml) consists of monotonous lithic and feldspathic turbidite metasandstone interbedded with metasiltstone deposited in an unconfined basin, probably in an intralobe setting (Phillips et al., 2011). Planar laminated and massive metasiltstone were deposited from waning turbidity currents (Bouma division TE) or suspension settling and represent hemipelagic sedimentation (Bouma division TF; Bouma, 1962). The c. 1856 Ma Maude Headley Member (P_-HCov-xmf-md) and c. 1846 Ma Butchers Gully Member (P_-HCob-xmf-mc) consist of lavas, volcaniclastic rocks, breccias, and metasedimentary turbidite units. These members represent submarine volcanism at interpreted intraplate volcanic centres (Taylor et al., 1995a,b; Warren 1997; Blake et al., 2000; Phillips et al., 2016).",,6000,,"The Halls Creek Group unconformably overlies the 1912-1904 Ma Sophie Downs Suite. West of the Saunders Creek Dome, the unconformity is a 2-10 m-thick zone of brecciation and strong shearing between metabasalt of the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (Sophie Downs Suite) and metasandstone in the Saunders Creek Formation Group (e.g. CXPGRD000127, HALLS CREKK, Zone 52, MGA 391588E 8001669N). This indicates a period of nondeposition, uplift, and erosion of the Sophie Downs Suite before the deposition of the Halls Creek Group. In other places in the Saunders Creek Dome the Saunders Creek Formation is concordant (but unconformable) with the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (e.g. DHBHCOB582, HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 386084E 7994773N).  The 1865-1850 Ma Tickalara Metamorphics and 1845-1840 Ma Koongie Park Formation (Central Zone of the Lamboo Province) are broadly coeval with sedimentation in the Biscay Formation and Olympio Formation. Both the Tickalara Metamorphics and Koongie Park Formation are in fault contact with the Halls Creek Group along the north-northeasterly trending Angelo, Halls Creek, and Osmond Faults.  Metadolerite sills of the c. 1835 Ma Woodward Dolerite intrude the Halls Creek Group and underlying Sophie Downs Suite. The 1832-1808 Ma Sally Downs Supersuite, which includes the c. 1808 Ma Mount Christine Granite (Page et al., 2001), intrudes the Halls Creek Group west of the McClintock Range between Mount Christine (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 301443E 7929327N) and Mount Dockrell (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 313881E 7921738N). The youngest intrusive unit is the San Sou Monzogranite, which intrudes the Halls Creek Group at c. 1788 Ma south of the McClintock Range in the Taylor Lookout area (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 321759E 7909295N).  The Moola Bulla Formation is unconformable or in fault contact with the Halls Creek Group. The age of the Moola Bulla Formation is poorly constrained, but it may be an age equivalent of the c. 1800 Ma Speewah Group. South of the Osmond Range, the Halls Creek Group is in fault contact with the c. 1800 Ma Red Rock Formation along the Osmond Fault. At its eastern extent the Neoproterozoic Ruby Plains Group and the Duerdin Group in the Albert Edward Range unconformably overlie the Halls Creek Group. The group is also locally in fault contact with the Cambrian Antrim Plateau Volcanics in the Albert Edward Range.",,17,,,Mixed,2,,,,1904,,1808,,"The age of the Halls Creek Group is well constrained by SHRIMP U-Pb igneous zircon and detrital zircon ages. A maximum age for the Halls Creek Group can be constrained by the minimum age in the unconformably underlying Sophie Downs Suite, the minimum age of which is provided by a muscovite schist from the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (GSWA 206150, Kirkland et al., 2015a). A weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1904 Â± 5 Ma, interpreted as the age of the volcanic protolith was provided by GSWA 206150 (Kirkland et al., 2015a; Phillips et al., 2016).  Maximum depositional ages of the Saunders Creek Formation are provided by two detrital samples with weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* dates of 2515 Â± 8 Ma (GA 87598028, Phillips et al., 2016) and 2508 Â± 8 Ma (GA 08TKHCO03, Phillips et al., 2016). Maximum depositional ages of the Brim Rockhole Formation are provided by two detrital samples with weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* dates of 2511 Â± 10 Ma (GSWA 206119, Kirkland et al., 2015b) and 1909 Â± 10 Ma (GSWA 206121, Wingate et al., 2015b). These ages are older than the unconformably underlying 1912-1904 Ma Sophie Downs Suite, which provides a maximum age constraint on the timing of sedimentation in the lower Halls Creek Group (Tyler et al., 1998; Blake et al., 1999; Kirkland et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2016). Consequently, the Halls Creek Group must be younger than c. 1904 Ma. A foliated felsic fragmental volcanic rock of the Brim Rockhole Formation is dated at 1881 Â± 4 Ma, which is interpreted as the age of volcanism (GA 93526012, Blake et al., 1999, Phillips et al., 2016). This volcanic age also constrains the age of coeval sedimentation in the Brim Rockhole Formation. Gradational contacts between the Brim Rockhole Formation and the underlying Saunders Creek Formation suggest that sedimentation in the Halls Creek Group began closer to c. 1881 Ma than c. 1904 Ma. Saunders Creek Formation and Brim Rockhole Formation metasandstone units were sourced from Paleoarchean- to Neoarchean-aged magmatic sources (Phillips et al., 2016).  Metasandstone units in the Biscay Formation contain detrital zircons dominated by Paleoproterozoic age components. These data indicate that there was a significant change in provenance within the Halls Creek Formation across the low-angle unconformity that separates the Brim Rockhole Formation and Biscay Formation north of the Sophie Downs Dome (Phillips et al., 2016). Three detrital zircon geochronology samples from the Biscay Formation provide weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* maximum depositional ages of 1872 Â± 5 (GSWA 206183, Lu et al., 2017a), 1872 Â± 6 (GSWA 206185, Lu et al., 2017b) and 1861 Â± 1 Ma (GSWA 206187, Kirkland et al., 2015c; Phillips et al., 2016).  The two metavolcanic members of the Olympio Formation have been dated and constrain the age of deep-marine volcanism and coeval turbidite sedimentation. A porphyritic felsic volcanic rock of the Maude Headley Member has a  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1856 Â± 6 Ma, which is interpreted as the age of volcanism (GA 85598001, Blake et al., 1999; Phillips et al., 2016). An amygdaloidal trachytic pillow lava of the Butchers Gully Member is dated at 1846 Â± 4 Ma, which is interpreted as the age of volcanism (GA 92524993C, Blake et al., 1999, Phillips et al., 2016). These two ages constrain the age of turbidite sedimentation in the Olympio Formation from c. 1856 to <1846 Ma. Detrital zircons from a sample of turbiditic metasandstone from the uppermost Olympio Formation indicate a maximum depositional age of 1834 Â± 9 Ma (GSWA 206184, Wingate et al., 2015a, Phillips et al., 2016). This depositional age is within uncertainty of the magmatic age of the 1832 Â± 5 Ma Mabel Downs Tonalite of the Sally Downs Supersuite (Bodorkos et al., 2000), which was emplaced during the Halls Creek Orogeny. This age suggests that the uppermost Halls Creek Group was still being deposited prior to and during the onset of the c. 1832-1808 Ma Halls Creek Orogeny. The Halls Creek Group was uplifted and eroded prior to deposition of Neoproterozoic sedimentary units, so the top of the Olympio Formation is not preserved and the time turbidite sedimentation ended is unknown. A minimum age for the Halls Creek Group is provided by the Mount Christine Granite of the Sally Downs Supersuite, which has an igneous crystallization age of 1808 Â± 3 Ma (Page et al., 2001).",No,,,13,h,No,Editor Reviewed,Yes,Yes,P_,HC,,40,18,,MIGIPBS,2.02E+13,,Yes,No

The group is 2.5 to 3 km thick, and contains the thickest and most extensive banded iron formations (BIF) in the world, as well as one of the best preserved transitions across the Archean-Proterozoic boundary. In addition to the well-known BIF, the Hamersley Group also comprises dolomite, shale, rhyolite, tuffaceous volcaniclastic rocks, and local dolerite sills. The Hamersley Group also records a rise in atmospheric oxygen before the start of the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), the oldest of the Huronian glaciations in Australia, and contains a unique but disputed record of Archean to early Proterozoic ocean chemistry.  The Hamersley Group conformably overlies the Fortescue Group, and is paraconformably overlain by the Turee Creek Group. The depositional environment is predominantly deep marine, well below storm wave-base, although a coeval carbonate platform existed to the northeast throughout deposition of the thick BIFs. A change in tectonic setting, from a passive to an active continental margin is recorded in the transition from the lower to the upper Hamersley Group. The age constraints on the Hamersley Group are good, and indicate that it was deposited between c. 2629 and 2420 Ma.","The 2.5 to 3 km thick Hamersley Group is exposed throughout the southern Pilbara region, most notably on the DAMPIER, YARRIE, YARRALOOLA, PYRAMID, NULLAGINE, WYLOO, MOUNT BRUCE, ROY HILL, BALFOUR DOWNS, TUREE CREEK, NEWMAN, and ROBERTSON 1:250 000 map sheets, where it forms the iconic Hamersley, Chichester and Ophthalmia Ranges. Regional aeromagnetic anomalies that are interpreted to be attributable to Hamersley Group banded iron formations extend under younger cover as far south as the Blair Fault on TUREE CREEK, where they are interpreted to be part of the Bandee Seismic Province (Johnson et al., 2013).","MacLeod et al. (1963) do not state the derivation of the name of the Hamersley Group, but it is presumably taken from the Hamersley Ranges, which constitute much of the high ground in the central part of the southern Pilbara region, including the highest peak in Western Australia, Mount Meharry.   The Hamersley Group was defined by (MacLeod et al., 1963) as the middle of three constituent groups of the Mount Bruce Supergroup. As originally defined, it is underlain by the Fortescue Group and overlain by the Wyloo Group. However, later recognition of significant angular unconformities within the Wyloo Group of MacLeod et al. (1963), lead to the elevation of the Turee Creek Formation to group status, and its recognition as the uppermost subdivision of the Mount Bruce Supergroup (Trendall, 1979). The Hamersley Group is formally subdivided into eight formations, which from bottom to top are the Marra Mamba Iron Formation, Wittenoom Dolomite, Mount Sylvia Formation, Mount McRae Shale, Brockman Iron Formation, Weeli Wolli Formation, Woongarra Rhyolite, and Boolgeeda Iron Formation. Also, the Carawine Dolomite in the northeast part of the province is a lateral equivalent of the uppermost Jeerinah Formation of the underlying Fortescue Group, and the lowermost Marra Mamba Iron Formation (Rasmussen et al., 2005), and is exposed mainly on the YARRIE, NULLAGINE and BALFOUR DOWNS 1:250 000 map sheets.   The Hamersley Group is also intruded by a number of unnamed dolerite sills which tend to be confined to specific lithological units, most notably the basal Marra Mamba Iron Formation, the Joffre Member of the Brockman Iron Formation, the Weeli Wolli Formation and Woongarra Rhyolite. Some of these sills are locally vesicular and may be associated with pillow basalts (for example in the Weeli Wolli Formation in Coondiner Gorge).  For specific map products the Hamersley Group has here been subdivided into three informal stratigraphic units so that more generalized levels of stratigraphic detail can be shown different scales. The lower Hamersley Group comprises the Marra Mamba Iron Formation, Wittenoom Dolomite, Mount Sylvia Formation, Mount McRae Shale and Carawine Dolomite, whereas the upper Hamersley Group comprises the Brockman Iron Formation, Weeli Wolli Formation, Woongarra Rhyolite, and Boolgeeda Iron Formation. Since the Mount Sylvia Formation and Mount McRae Shale were originally delineated primarily for their role as regional stratigraphic markers (MacLeod et al., 1963; MacLeod, 1966) and are too thin to be shown individually on large parts of regional-scale maps, they are also combined into a single unit for this purpose.",,"The Hamersley Group consists predominantly of chemical sedimentary rocks interbedded with fine-grained siliciclastic and volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks, as well as lesser felsic and mafic extrusive and intrusive igneous rocks, and very minor sandstone and glacigenic diamictite. The chemical sedimentary rocks include banded iron-formation (BIF), chert, and fine- to coarse-grained carbonates (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). Lithological variations of banded iron formation and chert are commonly described in terms their thickness, i.e. macrobands, mesobands, and microbands (Trendall and Blockley, 1970)  Siliciclastic sedimentary rocks are predominantly fine-grained, mainly mudstone and siltstone with a significant volcaniclastic component (LaBerge, 1966; Trendall and Blockley, 1970; Alibert and McCulloch, 1993; Pickard et al., 2004), with minor fine- to medium-grained sandstone and rare diamictite (Martin, 1999). Rare, thin, impact spherule layers have also been recorded (Hassler, 1993; Simonson and Hassler, 1997; Hassler et al., 2005; Hassler et al., 2011). A characteristic feature of the Hamersley Group is that individual lithologic units can be traced across the entire province with very little internal variation. This is particularly true of the banded iron formations in which it has been suggested that individual microbands, on the scale of millimetres, can be correlated across the entire region (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). However, more recent work has shown that such fine-scale regional correlation is not feasible (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003) and is restricted to the macroband level.","The earliest interpretations of the depositional environment of the Hamersley Group involved deposition in a large discrete basin, which was considered to be paralic and cut-off from the open ocean. This concept was introduced by MacLeod (1966) and later expanded upon by Trendall (1968) and Trendall and Blockley (1970) who used isopach data for the Dales Gorge Member of the Brockman Iron Formation to propose a simple, barred, ovoid basin with a depocentre in the vicinity of Mount Brockman. Trendall (1968) introduced the term Hamersley Basin for this depository, and later expanded it to include the underlying Fortescue Group (Trendall and Tyler, 1990). This later stratigraphic definition of the Hamersley Basin has persisted, but interpretations of the depositional environment and architecture of the basin have changed considerably.  Horwitz and Smith (1978) and Horwitz (1982) showed that the Fortescue Group thickens to the south, and forms a platform on which the Hamersley Group was deposited (Morris and Horwitz, 1983). The platform envisaged by Morris and Horwitz (1983) was interpreted to be isolated from any terrigenous clastic supply, and a deep ocean-basin setting was specifically precluded. However, a number of lines of new evidence suggest that during Hamersley Group times the basin consisted of a carbonate platform or shelf to the north and northeast that was marginal to a deep ocean-basin to the southwest. The evidence for this interpretation includes the recent demonstration that the Carawine Dolomite is partly coeval with the Marra Mamba Iron Formation and Jeerinah Formation (Rasmussen et al., 2005), paleocurrent data from turbidites in the Wittenoom Formation (Hassler, 1993) indicating southwesterly transport directions, the identification of siliciclastic and carbonate turbidites within the Mount Sylvia Formation, Mount McRae Shale, and Brockman Iron Formation (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003), carbonate debris flows and mega-breccias in the Joffre Member of the Brockman Iron Formation proximal to the Poonda Fault (Kepert, 2001), and interpretation of a largely submarine exhalative origin for the iron and silica in BIF that was deposited in pelagic to hemipelagic environments (Barley et al., 1997; KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003).  The precise location of the shelf-slope break separating carbonate-dominated shelf from BIF-dominated basin deposition is difficult to determine, but the Poonda Fault is inferred to mark the major topographic break between these two basin elements during deposition of the Joffre Member (Kepert, 2001). Deposition in the Carawine Dolomite to the northeast was predominantly in shallow water, above storm wave-base, whereas all of the strata in the main outcrop area of the Hamersley Group were deposited below storm wave-base (Simonson et al., 1993; KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003; Pickard et al., 2004). Average compacted depositional rates of the units deposited below wave-base are highly variable, and have been calculated at 180 m per million years for BIF, 12 m per million years for carbonate, and 5 m per million years for shale (Trendall et al., 2004). There are no depositional rates available for the shallow water Carawine Dolomite.  Microband pairs within chert and chert-matrix of the Hamersley Group have been interpreted by Trendall (1972) as varves, with each microband representing one year of deposition of colloidal chemical precipitates (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). However, the origin of microbanding within Hamersley Group BIF remains contentious, with recent studies suggesting that the primary sediments were not solely the product of pelagic settling of colloidal chemical precipitates (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003; Pickard et al., 2004) and that much of the present-day mineralogical composition is the product of post-depositional processes and is therefore not a proxy for oceanic or atmospheric chemistry (Bekker et al., 2014; Rasmussen et al., 2016).",,3000,,"The Marra Mamba Iron Formation at the base of the Hamersley Group conformably overlies the Jeerinah Formation at the top of the underlying Fortescue Group. The upper contact, between the Boolgeeda Iron Formation and the overlying Turee Creek Group, is generally not well exposed and has been regarded as gradational and conformable (e.g. MacLeod et al., 1963; Trendall and Blockley, 1970; Trendall, 1979). However, recent fieldwork has established the presence of a low-angle unconformity at the base of the Turee Creek Group 4.5 km south of Mount Wall on the HARDEY 1:100 000 map sheet.

The lower Hamersley Group conformably overlies the Fortescue Group and is exposed throughout the Hamersley Basin. It is conformably overlain by the upper Hamersley Group.

The carbonate rocks are mainly deep-water shelf deposits which lack any evidence of deposition above wave base. The only exception is the Carawine Dolomite which contains abundant indicators of shallow-water deposition such as stromatolites, oncolites, oolites, pisolites, wave ripples, and evaporite pseudomorphs (Simonson and Carney, 1999). The shales are predominantly carbonaceous and pyritic, and commonly interbedded with thin, laminated chert horizons.

Regional correlation of the Jeerinah impact spherule layer (Rasmussen et al., 2005) indicates that BIF deposition in the Marra Mamba Iron Formation was coeval with peritidal carbonate sedimentation in the Carawine Dolomite to the northeast and the Chichester Range constituted an intermediate carbonate facies iron-formation, deposited on a ramp in front of the Carawine shelf (Hurst et al., 2013).

This informal subdivision of the Hamersley Group is made on the basis that the lower part is dominated by rock types other than banded iron-formation (BIF), whereas the upper part consists predominantly of BIF with minor shale and igneous rocks. The upper Hamersley Group was deposited between c. 2494 and 2420 Ma, mainly in a pelagic to hemipelagic setting that was basinward of a major carbonate shelf whose deposits characterize the lower Hamersley Group. The deposition of BIF and shale that dominate the upper Hamersley Group was accompanied by mafic and felsic volcaniclastic sedimentation, minor extrusive mafic volcanism, and the intrusion of large volumes of dolerite sills.

The second most abundant lithology in the upper Hamersley Group is shale, which was derived from a mixture of terrigenous and volcaniclastic muds and silts (Pickard et al., 2004). A significant difference between the lower and upper Hamersley Groups is the presence of large volumes of igneous intrusive and extrusive rocks in the latter. Dolerite sills are rare in the Joffre Member of the Brockman Iron Formation and in the Woongarra Rhyolite, but in most areas make up more than 50% by thickness of the Weeli Wolli Formation. These sills are concordant to weakly discordant, and may post-date the Woongarra Rhyolite (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). The proportion of these dolerite sills varies, but they appear to be more voluminous in the south, decreasing in abundance northwards (Daniels and MacLeod, 1965). Sills are absent from the Weeli Wolli Formation in large parts of the far western Hamersley Basin. A thin pillow basalt unit and associated hyaloclastic breccia has been identified at the top of a dolerite sill in Coondiner Gorge (Tyler, 1991; Barley et al., 1997). The largest igneous unit in the upper Hamersley Group is the 400 m-thick Woongarra Rhyolite (Trendall, 1995).","The depositional environment of the upper Hamersley Group is dominated by pelagic to hemipelagic sedimentation basinward of a major carbonate shelf. Evidence for the deep-water depositional environment is provided by the absence of high-energy sedimentary structures, and the chemical and mineralogical composition of the finely laminated sedimentary rocks. The coeval existence of a carbonate platform to the north and northeast is documented by the presence of rare carbonate turbidites (Simonson and Hassler, 1996; KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003) and olistoliths (Kepert, 2001), particularly along the Hamersley Range front and proximal to the Poonda Fault. The magmatic rocks are interpreted to reflect a back-arc convergent tectonic setting and the emplacement of a bimodal large igneous complex (Blake and Barley, 1992; Barley et al., 1997).   Microband pairs within chert and chert matrix of the Hamersley Group have been interpreted by Trendall (1972) as varves, with each microband representing one year of deposition of colloidal chemical precipitates (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). However, the origin of microbanding within Hamersley Group BIF remains contentious. Recent studies suggesting that the primary sediments were not solely the product of pelagic settling of colloidal chemical precipitates (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003; Pickard et al., 2004).

Mount Hart itself is made of King Leopold Sandstone and the Hart Dolerite is exposed in the valley below.",,"The following description of the Hart Dolerite is taken from Sheppard et al. (2012):  The Hart Dolerite is a fine- to medium-grained dolerite, quartz dolerite, and gabbro. Dolerite is the most abundant lithology and is a fine- to medium-grained dolerite with an ophitic, subophitic, or intergranular texture. Plagioclase crystals display normal zoning, from cores of labradorite (An60-55) to rims of andesine (An45-40). The pyroxenes consist of pale purple-brown pigeonite and augite. Pigeonite is more abundant in most specimens, but locally augite predominates. On YAMPI 1:250 000, the main pyroxene is augite, which commonly mantles pigeonite or encloses it poikolitically (Sofoulis et al., 1971). Augite crystals commonly contain very fine exsolution lamellae of orthopyroxene parallel to the [100] plane in the host augite; in twinned crystals this exsolution produces a herringbone texture. Where exsolution lamellae are not present in augite, it is difficult to distinguish from pigeonite. Alvin (1993) also reported the presence of orthopyroxene in dolerite from the Speewah Valley on LISSADELL 1:250 000. Iron-titanium oxide minerals constitute about 3-10% of the rock. Interstitial quartz and granophyric intergrowths of quartz and K-feldspar are minor components (<2%).  Gabbro has a subhedral granular texture, but with the same mineralogy as the fine- to medium-grained dolerite. Crystals of Fe-Ti oxides in the gabbro are typically anhedral, and enclose small crystals of plagioclase and pyroxene. Olivine dolerite contains up to 15% anhedral crystals of olivine (Fo20), and plagioclase with more calcic cores (An70) than in the dolerite (Alvin, 1993). Quartz dolerite is medium grained, and contains a larger proportion of granophyric intergrowths of quartz and K-feldspar (5-15%), and less pyroxene and titanomagnetite than the dolerite.  Dolerite and gabbro samples exhibit weak to moderate alteration of plagioclase to fine-grained intergrowths of sericite and clinozoisite, and, rarely, prehnite. Pyroxene may be altered along its margins to fine-grained, palegreen amphibole or chlorite. Fresh olivine is present in specimens from the Speewah Valley (Alvin, 1993), but elsewhere it is pseudomorphed by pale-green chlorite, antigorite, and granular Fe-Ti oxide minerals (Gellatly et al., 1975). At the northwestern end of the Halls Creek Orogen, dolerite may be strongly chloritized or metamorphosed to amphibolite. Specimens from sills of Hart Dolerite that intrude the Warton Sandstone on YAMPI 1:250 000 consist of metamorphosed dolerite. Subophitic and intergranular igneous textures are partly preserved. Pyroxene is completely replaced by pale-green actinolite, and plagioclase is partially replaced by fine-grained albite or oligoclase, clinozoisite, and prehnite. Fine-grained tremolite has pseudomorphed what were probably euhedral olivine crystals.",,,3000,,"Sills of the Hart Dolerite intruded the entire Speewah Group and can be traced up into the two lowermost formations of the unconformably overlying Kimberley Group (King Leopold Sandstone and Carson Volcanics). The intrusion of Hart Dolerite sills was lithologically controlled, and several sills may be present at different stratigraphic levels in any one section. The dolerite commonly shows a marked preference for siltstone beds in the Speewah Group (Gellatly et al., 1975): for example, on LISSADELL 1:250 000, thick sills are developed along the base of the Valentine Siltstone, at the base of the Luman Siltstone, and along the contact between the Luman Siltstone and overlying Bedford Sandstone (Thorne et al., 1999).",,17,,,,4,,,,1799,17,1791,8,"Sheppard et al.

The minimum age of 1791 Â± 8 Ma was provided from sample GSWA 206156 by Wingate et al. (in prep). An average age of the granophyre unit is 1795 Â± 15 Ma.

The unit is dominated by quartz sandstone, which is commonly very well silicified (orthoquartzite), but is locally somewhat friable at some outcrops in WA. Pebble conglomerate is common lower in the formation, while siltstone interbeds are present near the top. The Heavitree Formation is correlated with the Kulail Sandstone and Dean Quartzite along the southern margin of the basin. The formation has not been precisely dated, but its age is broadly constrained to 976-830 Ma. ","Exposed along the full length of the northern margin of the Amadeus Basin, predominantly in the NT but extending west into WA, where it is also distributed in outlies of the Amadeus Basin within the Arunta region. In WA it is exposed mainly in the northeastern MACDONALD and southern WEBB 1:250 000 scale map sheet areas, with minor outcrop in southeast WILSON and northeast RYAN.

Alternatively, Plummer (2015) interpreted the Heavitree Formation and its equivalents throughout the Centralian Superbasin as a predominantly fluvial system that disgorged through deltaic systems into a central, shallow, marine-inuenced depocentre focussed on the Amadeus Basin. In the Pollock Hills region of the WA Amadeus Basin, the formation can be subdivided into a lower coarse to pebbly and conglomeratic uvial facies that is overlain by a finer and texturally more mature sandstone sequence considered to be of shallow marine origin (Haines et al., 2012; Haines and Allen, 2014).",100,300,,Unconformably overlies various Paleoproterozoic-Mesoproterozoic units of the Arunta region.

Age constraints on the Tollu Group have previously hinged on a 1078 Â± 5 Ma date obtained by Glikson et al. (1996) from an outcrop identified as rhyolite of the Smoke Hill Volcanics. Re-examination of that outcrop (Smithies et al., 2009) indicated that the rock is a fine- to medium-grained leucogranite, petrographically and texturally identical to a c. 1075 Ma leucogranite of the Warakurna Supersuite (P_-WK-g), and therefore not part of the Tollu Group.  Volcanic rocks at the base of the Tollu Group (Smoke Hill Volcanics) directly overlie the c. 1075 Ma layered mafic Blackstone intrusion of the Giles Suite (P_-WKG), which provides a maximum age constraint on Tollu volcanism. Dating of a vitric dacite sample, collected from the upper part of the Smoke Hill Volcanics on the northern limb of the Blackstone syncline (on BLACKSTONE), gave a crystallization age of 1026 Â± 26 Ma (GSWA 187177, Kirkland et al., 2010). However, two rhyolite samples collected from around Mount Jane (northeastern BLACKSTONE) in the east of the Blackstone syncline, have given ages of 1071 Â± 8 Ma (GSWA 191728, Coleman et al., 2010a) and 1073 Â± 7 Ma (GSWA 191706, Coleman et al., 2010b). A series of olivine gabbros, olivine norites, ferronorites, and ferrodiorites (Alcurra Dolerite, P_-WKal; previously P_-WKg3), which intruded into the Smoke Hill Volcanics in the western part of the Blackstone syncline, and similar rocks to the west (on COOPER and FINLAYSON), have also been dated at c. 1067 Ma (Seat, 2008; Howard et al., 2009). It is most likely that the 1026 Â± 26 Ma dacite represents a subvolcanic sill younger than the Smoke Hill Volcanics (belonging either to the Hogarth Formation, or younger units), and instead provides a minimum crystallization age for the Tollu Group. Regardless, there must have been a hiatus between emplacement of the Blackstone intrusion and deposition of the Tollu Group, with an intervening period of major uplift and erosion affecting the layered mafic intrusion.",No,,,1,,No,Submitted,No,No,P_,TLh,,,,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.01E+13,Yes,No

The c. 2718 Ma age of a crosscutting granitic rocks provides a minimum age constraint.","The Honman Formation (Gower and Bunting, 1976) is mainly exposed on the western side of the Lake Johnston greenstone belt on JOHNSTON, ROUNDTOP and TAY with only a few isolated outcrops on the eastern side of the belt on JOHNSTON and BRONZITE RIDGE.","The Honman Formation is named after Honman Ridge (Zone 51, MGA 277921E 6409553N), which is a prominent banded iron-formation ridge on JOHNSTON. Honman Ridge is named after CS Honman, who published the first geological investigations of the Lake Johnston area (Honman, 1914). The formation was first named and described by Gower and Bunting (1972).

The chert and banded iron-formation form prominent ridges and hills, such as the Honman Ridge and Round Top Hill. Adjacent felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks are typically weathered and poorly exposed, and their relationship to the Honman Formation is unclear.  In a detailed, mine-scale study, Heggie et al. (2012) described a succession of pale grey, metamorphosed dacitic and rhyolitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks (A-fd-YYO, A-xmfs-mhs-YYO) adjacent to clastic metasedimentary rocks that may represent the lower part of the Honman Formation. These are in turn juxtaposed to the dominant metamorphosed chert (A-_hm-cx) and to banded iron-formation (A-_hm-cib).

The latter sample was taken from a drillhole (DDH 08NLJD0122, supplied by Norilsk Nickel; SSRRTP000407, Zone 51, MGA 260387E 6437276N) that also contained a felsic volcanic unit with an age of c. 2921 Ma (GSWA 207517, preliminary data). Another felsic volcaniclastic unit, collected from a drillhole 8.4 km along strike to the southeast, has an age of c. 2876 Ma (Sample LJD-00110770, Romano et al., 2014). Other samples collected from diamond drillholes in the area southeast of Round Top Hill have ages of c. 2924 Ma (GSWA 207513, preliminary data) and c. 2916 Ma (GSWA 20514, preliminary data). Relationships within the felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic units are unclear and it is possible they represent at least two distinct successions. These may include an older c. 2920 Ma succession and a younger c. 2735-2720 Ma succession that is equivalent to felsic volcanic successions to the north such as the Marda Complex on JACKSON (Riganti and Chen, 2002) and in the Gum Creek greenstone belt on MONTAGU (Bodorkos et al., 2006; Wyche and Doyle, 2007).  The minimum age for the formation is indicated by crosscutting granite with an age of c. 2718 Ma (Romano et al., 2014).  It is possible that the Honman Formation and overlying formations, including the Roundtop Komatiite and Glasse Formation, are all younger than the c. 2725 Ma age of the dated felsic unit from near Round Top Hill.

Outcrops are restricted to the LIGHTFOOT sheet as pavements and weathered breakaways along the western margin of paleolakes. The unit is intercalated with minor amphibolite and has at least two deformation phases which occurred prior to the intrusion of low-Ca granites and dykes at c. 2645 Ma. ","The Hope Campbell Orthogneiss is interpreted to cover approximately 344 sq km, however the vast majority of the rock is hidden beneath sandplains. Crop outs of the orthogneiss are limited to small flat pavements and weathered breakaways along the western margins of the Balpe Lakes system and Lake Lightfoot, and small pavements within the eolian sands up to 9 km north of Granite Hill (Zone 51 MGA 522541E 6749052N). An east-west track, from the main Stella Range track to the Jasper Hill track, crosses over some of the northernmost pavements, making access to the orthogneiss very accessible. Areas of pavement exposed within sandplains and heavily vegetated areas are commonly identified by the presence of well-established Kurrajong trees. ","A small hill along the interpreted northern margin of the orthogneiss is called Hope Campbell Hill (Zone 51 MGA 522675E, 6767986N) ",,"Solid-state fabrics are well preserved, but within the grey coloured orthogneiss foliation-parallel, coarse-grained leucocratic bands with diffuse contacts are characteristic of stromatic structures observed in metatexitic migmatites. Locally, leucocratic melts have been injected post development of a tectonic fabric, but are subsequently cut by small NNW-trending shears 20-80 mm wide. The predominant sense of shear is dextral, but sinistral movement is also observed. At least two deformation fabrics have developed within the orthogneiss. Sufficient relief on an outcrop (Zone 51 MGA 521698E 6754928N), approximately 6 km north of Granite Hill has a well developed, shallow, southward dipping foliation (22&deg; towards 188&deg;) which is overprinted by a weak upright cleavage (90&deg; towards 270&deg;). Cross-cutting both fabrics are undeformed granitic and pegmatitic dykes.. Petrograghically the orthogneiss comprises 70-80% quartz, 10-18% plagioclase, 2-3% microcline and 5-8% biotite. Subordinate minerals include magnetite, chlorite after biotite, zircon and epidote. ",,,,,"Contact relationships between the orthogneiss and other rock types are very rarely observed. Approximately 1.3 km east-southeast of Granite Hill, fine-grained amphibolites are intercalated with the orthogneiss and the contacts are parallel to the regional tectonic grain. The primary contact relationship was probably intrusive; however this relationship has subsequently been overprinted by later deformation events. The age of the Balpe Lakes Monzogranite (c. 2643 Ma) indicates an intrusive relationship to the protolith of orthogneiss. The age of the monzogranite and undeformed granitic dykes which cross-cut the Hope Campbell Orthogneiss, the latter very similar in composition, intrusive style and age to granitic dykes (c.2645 Ma) cross-cutting the Surprise Orthogneiss, place a minimum age on deformation.

Subsequently the basal sandstone (Mount Vernon Sandstone) was separated from this unit, leaving the Kurabuka Formation to include only the upper shale unit (Brakel and Muhling, 1976). At the same time an equivalent shale unit, the Ilgarari Beds, was defined in the eastern facies of the Bangemall Group (Brakel and Muhling, 1976; Chuck, 1984; Muhling and Brakel, 1985). The Ilgarari Beds were later renamed the Ilgarari Formation and assigned to the Collier Subgroup by Muhling and Brakel (1985), whereas the laterally equivalent Kurabuka Formation was placed in the Mucalana Subgroup. In order to apply a consistent regional stratigraphic framework, Cooper et al. (1998) abandoned the Mucalana Subgroup and the constituent formations were renamed and incorporated into the Collier Subgroup. As a result, the name Ilgarari Formation was applied not only in eastern and central parts of the 'Bangemall Basin', but also in the west, where it replaced the former Kurabuka Formation. This definition of the Ilgarari Formation was subsequently used by Martin et al. (1999), Martin and Thorne (2002), and Martin et al. (2005).  The Ilgarari Formation was named after the Ilgarari mine (Zone 50, MGA 760800E 7303000N) on ILGARARI (Muhling and Brakel, 1985). Poor exposure prevented the establishment of a type section. However, a type area was defined in the vicinity of Mardinindya Well (Zone 50, MGA 753380E 7312900N), 12 km northwest of the Ilgarari mine (Muhling and Brakel, 1985).  ",,"The Ilgarari Formation (P_-MCi-sl) consists of siltstone and fine-grained sandstone, along with minor chert and limestone. A relatively thick chert body is present on southeastern CALYIE and northeastern JAMINDI and has been mapped as a separate member (P_-MCi-cl). The Ilgarari Formation is generally poorly exposed and is commonly silicified and ferruginous. It is intruded by numerous mafic sills of c. 1070 Ma Kulkatharra Dolerite.  Siltstones are generally greenish-grey to black when fresh and are commonly pyritic, carbonaceous, and micaceous. Dolomitic siltstones have also been recorded by Muhling and Brakel (1985). Most siltstones are either massive or parallel-planar laminated. Fine-grained sandstones are generally thinly bedded and have either a massive or parallel-planar laminated internal structure. Some bedding surfaces are pebbly and occurrences of low-angle ripple cross-lamination are observed on CALYIE. Thin-bedded, recrystallized limestone has been recorded on MOUNT VERNON. Most beds are either massive or parallel-planar laminated, although small cone-in-cone structures have also been observed.  A sample of siltstone (GSWA 156880; AMTBAN002477; Zone 50, MGA 765734E 7300740N) taken from the Ilgarari Formation contains up to 0.03% total organic carbon. In common with other similar material taken from the Edmund and Collier Groups, the sample is highly mature and has exhausted its petroleum generating potential (A Ghori, 2010, written comm. 12 May).","The Ilgarari Formation was probably deposited in a generally anoxic, relatively deep-marine environment that received only minor amounts of fine-grained, sand-sized detritus. Massive to parallel-planar laminated siltstones are interpreted as deep-water suspension or dilute turbidity current deposits, whereas fine-grained sandstones were probably deposited from either low-density turbidity currents or weak shelf traction currents. Dolomitic siltstones and thin dolostones are likely to have been deposited during periods of limited siliciclastic sediment input. The formation records a major regional flooding event and is interpreted as a transgressive, deep-marine shelf deposit by Martin and Thorne (2004).",,1500,,"The Ilgarari Formation has a sharp, conformable lower contact with the underlying Calyie Formation.

Most outcrops are low and poorly exposed and may contain abundant cubes and anhedral aggregates of oxidized pyrite, which on CANDOLLE may be up to 2 cm in diameter.  Siltstone and dolomitic siltstone units are mostly thinly to thickly bedded with tabular bed geometry. Their internal structure is dominated by parallel planar to undulatory lamination and ripple cross-lamination. On MANGAROON and MAROONAH, these lithologies have a strong, bedding-parallel fissility. Symmetrical, straight-crested ripples are preserved on some coarse-grained siltstone bedding planes. Samples of carbonaceous siltstone taken from unit P_-MEi-sl contain up to 5% total organic carbon. Like all other samples taken from the Edmund and Collier Groups, the samples are highly mature and have exhausted their petroleum generating potential (A Ghori, 2011, written comm.).

Fine- to medium-grained sandstones commonly exhibit parallel-planar and undulatory lamination, ripple cross-lamination, and small-scale trough cross-stratification. Medium- to very coarse-grained sandstones are thinly to very thickly bedded with a tabular to lenticular geometry. Some beds are massive, whereas others are normally graded and display solitary or stacked sets of medium-scale cross-stratification. Parallel stratification and flute marks have also been observed in some very coarse-grained sandstone beds. Many medium- to very coarse-grained sandstones have a ferruginous carbonate cement, and layers of granule- to pebble-sized mudstone or carbonate intraclasts are present in some beds.

4118,27168,P_-HAbj-cib,4113,Joffre Member,1,"Banded iron-formation, chert, mudstone, and siltstone; minor dolerite sills","Although the 360 m-thick Joffre Member does not contain any known iron ore deposits, it is an important unit within the Brockman Iron Formation as it is widely regarded as being the thickest and most extensive banded iron-formation (BIF) unit in the world. It differs from the underlying Dales Gorge Member in that it is not regularly macrobanded and contains abundant volcaniclastic debris. The Joffre Member consists of distinctive thin-bedded BIF, interbedded with varying proportions of minor shale. The proportion of shale allows a further subdivision into six informal units, which are most easily identified in natural gamma-ray logs. Dolerite sills are intruded into the middle to upper parts of the member in the western part of the southern Pilbara Region. Five units of porcelanite, consisting of black, brittle potassium feldspar with a flinty fracture form distinctive markers within the member. Tuffaceous stilpnomelane-rich shales are also common and are characteristically tough, black, blocky, and homogenous with a conchoidal fracture. The Joffre Member gradationally overlies the Whaleback Shale Member, and, in turn, is conformably overlain by the Yandicoogina Shale Member. The Joffre Member was deposited in a deep-marine pelagic to hemipelagic environment in front of a carbonate platform between c. 2461 and 2459 Ma.","The Joffre Member is generally considered to be about 360 m thick (Trendall and Blockley, 1970; Harmsworth et al., 1990). Anyhow, thickness does vary and regional measurements suggest an overall thinning towards the south (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). The Joffre Member is present throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region at the top of the Brockman Iron Formation on the 1:250 000 map sheets DAMPIER, YARRALOOLA, PYRAMID, WYLOO, MOUNT BRUCE, ROY HILL, TUREE CREEK, NEWMAN, and ROBERTSON where it forms conspicuous cliffs and high domed hills.","This unit was originally named the Mindy Mindy Member by Ryan and Blockley (1965). However, it was renamed and formally defined by Trendall and Blockley (1970) who specified a type section at Yandicoogina Creek (Zone 50, MGA 722208E 7474284N) where the unit is well exposed for 3 km along the east side of the creek. The Joffre Member is also well exposed and easily accessible in the gorges downstream of Joffre Falls (Zone 50, MGA 630562E 7523316N), and in Cathedral Gorge (Zone 50, MGA 768555E 7423647N) on the Great Northern Highway 15 km northwest of Newman.  The Joffre Member is commonly subdivided into six informal units by the iron ore industry (designated J1 to J6) based on variations in the proportion of shale within the BIF (Harmsworth et al., 1990), although Pickard (2002) recognizes seven units defined on a similar basis in the Silvergrass Syncline. Units J1, J3, and J5 consist of shaly BIF, which is easily identified in natural gamma-ray logs. The remainder of the member (J2, J4, and J6) consists of thinly bedded BIF.",,"Although the 360 m-thick Joffre Member does not contain any known iron ore deposits, it is an important unit within the Brockman Iron Formation as it is widely regarded as being the thickest and most extensive banded iron-formation (BIF) unit in the world (Trendall and Blockley, 1970; Haugaard et al., 2016).   The Joffre Member does not contain distinct macrobands unlike the remainder of the Brockman Iron Formation. It consists mainly of uniformly thin-bedded BIF with thin interbeds of stilpnomelane-rich shale and porcelanite. Lithological variations within the Joffre Member are subtle in outcrop, and generally a lot easier to recognize in natural gamma-ray logs (Trendall and Blockley, 1970; Harmsworth et al., 1990). They more reliably discriminate between homogeneous BIF and shaly BIF, although this is not always the case (Pickard, 2002). BIF within the Joffre Member displays similar mesobanding and microbanding characteristics to those of the Dales Gorge Member, but magnetite and carbonate mesobands are rare. The BIF mesobands consist predominantly of chert and chert matrix in which the latter is characteristically dark bluish grey to black (due to the presence of disseminated riebeckite), and the former either white or red. Both have faint to well-developed microbanding spaced 0.5 - 1 mm apart (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). The tuffaceous stilpnomelane-rich shales are generally about 2-60 cm thick and characteristically tough, black, blocky, and homogenous with a conchoidal fracture. In contrast, the porcelanites are of similar thickness, but are more brittle with a flinty fracture pattern and consist predominantly of potassium feldspar (Trendall, 1969; Trendall and Blockley, 1970; Trendall and De Laeter, 1972; Pickard, 2002). Three distinct levels of carbonate debris flows and megaclasts have been documented by Kepert (2001) over about 4 km of strike in the J3 to J5 part of the member, about 3 km east of Weeli Wolli Creek (Zone 50, MGA 743308E 7483246N). These horizons are usually referred to as JC1 to JC3 and are also informally referred to as the Mindy debris flows. These flows are unique in the Hamersley Group, consisting of a clast-supported framework of shallow-water facies carbonate clasts in a fine-grained carbonate matrix. They are locally associated with partial to complete Bouma sequences. Locally, dolerite sills are intruded in the middle to upper parts of the member, particularly in the western part of the southern Pilbara region (Thorne and Tyler, 1997; Taylor et al., 2001).","The absence of sedimentary structures is indicative of deposition above storm wave-base. Furthermore, gross lithological similarities with the Dales Gorge Member suggest that the Joffre Member was deposited in a deep-marine pelagic to hemipelagic environment in front of a carbonate platform (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003; Pickard et al., 2004). The Mindy debris flows in particular provide convincing evidence that BIF deposition was coeval with proximal collapse of a shallow-water carbonate platform margin that existed to the northeast (Kepert, 2001, 2018). In addition, the abundance of fine-grained volcaniclastic material in the Joffre Member and lower proportion of terrigenous detritus (Pickard, 2002) attests to a relative increase in volcanic activity distal to the site of deposition. This is perhaps related to the initiation of a large bimodal igneous province (Barley et al., 1997) or of active margin tectonics (Blake and Barley, 1992).  Microband pairs within chert and chert-matrix of the Hamersley Group have been interpreted by Trendall (1972) as varves, with each microband representing one year of deposition of colloidal chemical precipitates (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). However, the origin of microbanding within Hamersley Group BIF remains contentious, with recent studies suggesting that the primary sediments were not solely the product of pelagic settling of colloidal chemical precipitates (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003; Pickard et al., 2004). Much of the present-day mineralogical composition is rather the product of post-depositional processes and is therefore not a proxy for oceanic or atmospheric chemistry (Bekker et al., 2014; Rasmussen et al., 2016).",,360,,"The Joffre Member conformably overlies the Whaleback Shale Member, and, in turn, is conformably overlain by the Yandicoogina Shale Member. The basal contact is clearly defined in drillhole W47A, which contains part of the type section of the Dales Gorge Member. It is stored in the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) Core Library in Carlisle. Both the upper and lower contacts are not well exposed in outcrop. In the vicinity of the type section in the Yandicoogina Syncline, the top of the member is marked by a distinctive 2.5 m-thick bed of thick-banded cherty iron formation which locally contains crocidolite (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). In steeply dipping strata, the upper contact is commonly marked by a break in slope at the transition from BIF to shale. This distinction is not obvious in shallow-dipping regions where the contact is commonly concealed.",,17,,,,5,,,,2461,,2459,,"The Joffre Member has been extensively and reliably dated by virtue of the abundance of volcaniclastic tuffs (Pickard, 2002; Trendall et al., 2004), although many of these dates are within uncertainty of each other.

The aeromagnetic anomalies are inferred to be a basaltic component of the Johnnys Creek Formation of the Bitter Springs Group. Basalt units (flows and possibly shallow sills) outcrop in the Johnnys Creek Formation in the northeastern Amadeus Basin in the Northern Territory (NT), and have also been intersected in mineral and petroleum exploration drillholes in the same area (Edgoose, 2013, Normington et al., 2015; Normington, 2018). Multiple horizons may be present at individual localities. Linear aeromagnetic anomalies that are likely to represent correlative rocks are common in the southwest part of the NT Amadeus Basin; two drillholes into such anomalies 52 km east of Yulara intersected basalt, with the overlying lithologies consistent with Bitter Springs Group (Bladon and Davies, 1982). The linear anomalies in Western Australia (WA) are inferred to represent the same stratigraphy. The magnetic unit in MOUNT BUTTFIELD comprises two closely spaced parallel linear anomalies that together trace out the structures of a doubly-plunging syncline stratigraphically some distance above outcrops of Dean Quartzite, consistent with a position in the upper Bitter Springs Group, i.e. Johnnys Creek Formation. The anomalies in REBECCA are apparently fragmented by faulting, but are likewise in an area interpreted as Bitter Springs Group under cover. Basalts in the Johnnys Creek Formation have not been successfully dated but are inferred to be of upper Tonian age (800-720 Ma). ","Informal unit P_-BSj-bb forms linear aeromagnetic anomalies under cover in the southern MOUNT BUTTFIELD and northeastern REBECCA map sheet areas, but is not known to outcrop. In the MOUNT BUTTFIELD area the unit is expressed as two closely spaced parallel linear anomalies that together trace out the structures of a doubly-plunging syncline under the plain between Mount Buttfield and the Schwerin Mural Crescent.  In the REBECCA area the unit is present beneath the plain north of Bloods Range.  The unit is inferred to extends eastward from REBECCA into the NT under cover for at least 300 km based on aeromagnetic anomalies, and presumably equivalent basalts outcrop in the Johnnys Creek Formation of the northeast Amadeus Basin up to 660 km east of the WA-NT border.    ",,,"Informal unit P_-BSj-bb does not outcrop in Western Australia. Drilling of similar aeromagnetic anomalies in the Northern Territory (BMR Ayers Rock 1, 2) intersected altered basalt (Bladon and Davis, 1982). The basalt was reported to be medium bluish grey, fine-grained, porphyritic and closely-fractured, with light grey mottling as a prominent feature. It is strongly altered to a chlorite-sericite rock containing dull black chlorite as a replacement of probable subhedral to anhedral olivine phenocrysts, and abundant opaque minerals including pyrite, magnetite, chalcopyrite, and possible ilmenite. Chlorite (particularly as fan-shaped aggregates), quartz, calcite, epidote, actinolite and colloform goethite are common in veins, and quartz is present in amygdales. Possible pillow structures were observed at several levels, suggesting eruption into water, and abundant amygdales suggest that lavas make up much of the basalt sequence. More than one flow appears to be represented. There is no evidence of interbedded sediment.",,,,,"Basalt units within the Johnnys Creek Formation in the northeastern Amadeus Basin (NT) are interbedded within intervals of red dolomitic mudstone and are interpreted as flows (Normington, 2018).

However, this correlation is inconsistent with inferred dating of the underlying Loves Creek Formation to 810-790 Ma based on global chemostratigraphic correlations (Klaebe et al., 2017, and references therein).

In Western Australia (WA) outcrop of the formation is limited, with the best exposures in the Boord Ridges (northeast MACDONALD 1:250 000 scale map sheet) where it consists of cycles of dolomite and limestone with recessive interbeds of siltstone and sandstone (Haines et al., 2010, 2012; Haines and Allen, 2014). The formation is locally stromatolitic in the NT and contains abundant stromatolites in WA (Allen et al., 2012). It conformably overlies the Pertatataka Formation, and is gradationally overlain by the Carnegie Formation (in WA) or the Arumbera Sandstone (NT). It represents the local uppermost unit of Supersequence 3 of the Centralian Superbasin (Supersequence terminology of Walter et al., 1995). The formation is of mid-Ediacaran age based on stratigraphic position and biostratigraphy (Allen et al., 2012; Haines and Allen, 2014).            ","The Julie Formation is widespread in the northeastern Amadeus Basin in the NT. In the southern and western NT Amadeus Basin an equivalent unit is probably present, at least locally within the Inindia beds, but has probably been removed by erosion in some southern areas. In WA the formation outcrops in the Boord Ridges, around an unnamed syncline c. 20 km west of the Boord Ridges, and in a syncline c. 20 km west of Bonython Range (all in the eastern half of the MACDONALD 1:250 000 map sheet area). In areas further south the Julie Formation, if originally present, has been mostly removed by erosion before deposition of the Carnegie Formation.  ","The  Julie Member  was originally part of the Pertatataka Formation as defined by Wells et al. (1967) in the northeastern Amadeus Basin in the NT. The unit was raised to formation status when the Pertatataka Formation was revised by Preiss et al. (1978). The name was presumably derived from Julie Tank (ALICE SPRINGS 1:250 000 map sheet area). The type section is along the east bank of Ross River just south of Ross River homestead (ALICE SPRINGS 1:250 000 map sheet area) where it is 137 m thick (Wells et al., 1967). The type section is dominated by dolomite and limestone, with minor siltstone and sandstone. In WA the unit was originally mapped as the upper carbonate-dominated part of the now abandoned  Boord Formation  of Wells et al. (1961, 1964).",,"In the best exposures in the Boord Ridges, the Julie Formation comprises as a cyclical series of low strike ridges of limestone and dolomite, separated by broader recessive intervals that are either covered or display poor outcrop of siltstone, thin-bedded limestone or dolomite, and friable sandstone (Haines and Allen, 2014). The carbonate ridges vary from about one to 10 m in thickness and comprise light to dark grey limestone or buff-coloured dolomite. Occasionally limestone and dolomite are interbedded. Both carbonates vary from micritic, to ooid and peloidal packstones and grainstones. Stromatolites and microbially laminated boundstone are common. Patchy diagenetic silicification is common, with chert often showing replacement of original carbonate textures, such as ooids. Black chert nodules, probably formed during very early diagenesis, are locally present. In the upper part of the formation some chert nodules show  cauliflower  textures interpreted as a replacement of sulphate evaporites such as anhydrite or gypsum. The stromatolite assemblage is diverse and includes  Tungussia julia ,  Tesca stewartii , possible  Georgina howchini  and undescribed taxa (Allen et al., 2012). The Boord Ridges is the type locality for  T. stewartii  (Walter et al., 1979).","The Julie Formation was deposited in a shallow marine shelf setting (Haines and Allen, 2014).

The unit is dominated by foliated, fine-grained, leucocratic monzogranite with fine-grained, granular quartz, plagioclase (albite-oligoclase), microcline, and biotite. The Junda Microgranite is intruded by pegmatite veins and dykes. It is unconformably overlain by metasedimentary units of the lower Halls Creek Group (Saunders Creek Formation and Brim Rockhole Formation). The Junda Microgranite has a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1911 Â± 5 Ma, which is interpreted to be the age of magmatic crystallization.","The Junda Microgranite has a restricted distribution, which has only been described from the southern portion of DOCKRELL about 90 km southwest of Halls Creek. Five outcrop areas less than 30 km apart have been identified centered on the Taylor Lookout area (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 321759E 7909295N). Each exposure is between 1 and 3 km long and generally low-lying, but forms rugged hills southwest of Junda Bore (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 321128E 7918023N).","The Junda Microgranite was named after exposures around Junda Bore (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 321128E 7918023N; Tyler et al., 1994).",,"Very little work has been published on the Junda Microgranite. The formation has only been described from the southern portion of DOCKRELL. In this location, Tyler et al. (1998) described the Junda Microgranite to be mostly foliated and partly recrystallized, fine-grained leucocratic monzogranite (or uncommon metamicromonzogranite). These rocks are composed of fine-grained, granular quartz, plagioclase (albite-oligoclase), and microcline with a few percent of chocolate-brown biotite in small clots. Samples also include a small amount of muscovite, commonly intergrown with biotite. Epidote, zircon, apatite, and allanite are typically with or are included within biotite. Biotite and fine-grained mafic inclusions are flattened in the foliation. Narrow shear zones and closely spaced fractures are common in more massive exposures (Tyler et al., 1998). The Junda Microgranite is locally mylonitic. The mylonitic fabric is parallel to the fabric in the overlying metasedimentary rocks of the Halls Creek Group, with minerals stretched into the foliation. Example of that are patches of muscovite up to 3 mm long are aligned in the fabric, which are situated about 10 km southeast of Mount Dockrell off the Ballara Road (IMTHCO001720, DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 315660E 7911656N). Fine gneissic banding is preserved by fine-grained, quartz-rich bands which appear to be intrafolial and isoclinally folded, e.g. southwest of Junda Bore and immediately east of the Old Ballara Road (TJG108547, DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 320300E 7916900N). The Junda Microgranite is intruded by pegmatite veins and dykes (quartz-albite).",The Junda Microgranite is considered to be a wholly intrusive unit.,,,,"The Junda Microgranite is unconformably overlain by metasedimentary rocks of the >1904 to c. 1834 Ma Halls Creek Group. The Saunders Creek Formation, the oldest unit in the Halls Creek Group, The age of the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics is well constrained to 1912-1904 Ma by three samples. A metamorphosed, fragmentary foliated, and fragmental felsic volcanic rock from the core of the Brim Anticline (GA 93526009, Blake et al., 1999b, HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 382810E, 7993117N) yielded a weighted mean 207Pb*/206Pb* date of 1912 Â± 3 Ma from 32 analyses that were <5% discordant (Blake et al., 1999a,b). Similarly, another metamorphosed fragmentary foliated and fragmental felsic volcanic rock from the northern end of the Saunders Creek Dome (GA 88598005, Blake et al., 1999b, HALLS CREEK, MGA Zone 52 390632E, 8000774N) yielded a weighted mean 207Pb*/206Pb* date of 1910 Â± 5 Ma from 30 analyses that were <5% discordant (Blake et al., 1999b; Phillips et al., 2016). These ages are interpreted to be the age of volcanism in the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics. Another sample from the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics, a quartzofeldspathic muscovite-bearing gneiss from the west-central Saunders Creek Dome, is considered to be a mylonitic felsic volcanic rock (GSWA 206150, Kirkland et al., 2015; HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 386980E 7995934N). This sample yielded a weighted mean 207Pb*/206Pb* date of 1904 Â± 5 Ma from 49 analyses that were <5% discordant, interpreted to be the age of the volcanic protolith (Kirkland et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2016).  The Ding Dong Downs Volcanics are unconformably overlain by the Brim Rockhole Formation of the Halls Creek Group. The Brim Rockhole Formation contains a felsic volcanic unit which has been dated at 1881 Â± 3 Ma. It is interpreted as the age of volcanism (GA 93526012, Blake et al., 1999b; HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 379214E, 8000834N; Blake et al., 1999a,b; Phillips et al., 2016).

Metasedimentary rocks of the Brim Rockhole Formation, Halls Creek Group, also unconformably overlie the Junda Microgranite. Phillips et al. (2016) suggested that meta-igneous rocks of the Sophie Downs Suite were exposed during deposition of the lower Halls Creek Group and exerted a topographic control on sedimentation. It is possible that the Junda Microgranite and coeval formations of the Sophie Downs Suite on DOCKRELL may have exerted a similar control on the deposition of the Halls Creek Group. Hence, the Junda Microgranite might unconformably underlie the Saunders Creek Formation and Brim Rockhole Formation in the same area. Contacts with the metasedimentary rocks of the Brim Rockhole Formation are commonly under cover, or contact zones are mylonitic, sheared, and intruded by quartz veins (Griffin and Tyler, 1994; Tyler et al., 1998). The Junda Microgranite is locally in fault contact with the Olympio Formation, the youngest unit in the Halls Creek Group. Examples of faulted contacts are found along the roughly east to west-trending Haughton Fault and north-northeasterly trending Woodward Fault, both on southern DOCKRELL (Tyler et al., 1994).",,17,,,,4,,,,1911,5,1911,5,"The Junda Microgranite has been sampled for U-Pb zircon dating.

The formation has a maximum thickness of about 120 m and has been recorded on MOUNT STUART and PANNAWONICA and in strongly deformed sections to the south of Mount Alexander on UAROO and BOOLALOO. Around MOUNT STUART and PANNANWONICA it has a conformable, gradational contact with the underlying Duck Creek Dolomite and is unconformably overlain by the Bywash Formation of the Capricorn Group. On UAROO and BOOLALOO, the rocks form the core of a regional-scale doubly plunging anticline and the lowermost contacts are not exposed. The upper contacts are gradational into quartzites and ironstones of the Ashburton Formation. The June Hill Volcanics were deposited in a coastal to shallow-marine environment at c. 1799 Ma.","The June Hill Volcanics (P_-WYj-b) outcrop on MOUNT STUART and a small part of PANNAWONICA. They are up to 120 m thick in the vicinity of June Hill (Zone 50, MGA 424566E 7512627N) on southern MOUNT STUART, but become thinner northwards and wedge out east of Red Hill Well (Zone 50, MGA 403570E 7553670N) on the northern part of this map sheet. Williams (1966) reports that a localized suite of strongly chloritized and carbonated, possibly acid lava and intrusive rocks are associated with and overlie the Duck Creek Dolomite immediately northeast of Deepdale Camp (Zone 50, MGA 405040E 7600200N) on PANNAWONICA. Ferruginous shale, tuff, and thin beds of stromatolitic dolomite are interbedded with the volcanic rocks, which are correlated with the June Hill Volcanics.","The name 'June Hill Volcanics' was first used by Williams (1966) in reference to the suite of volcanic rocks that are present at the top of the Duck Creek Dolomite on WYLOO and YARRALOOLA (1:250 000). Although the name was not employed on the first edition of WYLOO (1:250 000) (Daniels, 1970) it was eventually used on the second edition of this map sheet by Seymour et al. (1988), who also raised the unit to formation status.  No type section for the June Hill Volcanics has been defined, however, it is well exposed in outcrops immediately north of June Hill on MOUNT STUART.",,"The June Hill Volcanics is composed of mafic to felsic volcanic rocks interbedded with a diverse assemblage of non-volcanic sedimentary rocks. The volcanic rocks range from coherent mafic lava, pillow lava, and fine- to very coarse-grained mafic volcaniclastic rock to felsic volcaniclastic rock. Some of the lavas may be intermediate in composition and many of the volcanic rocks have undergone extensive carbonate alteration and veining. The formation is characterized by complex vertical and lateral facies variations, particularly in the June Hill area. Furthermore, a ?localized angular unconformity has been reported from within the succession in this area (Evans et al., 2003).  Coherent mafic to intermediate lava flows are generally up to 5 m thick and are massive to amygdaloidal. Most are aphyric, although feldspar-phyric varieties with phenocyrsts up to 2 mm long are locally recognized. Contorted flow banding and xenoliths of mafic volcanic rock, conglomerate, sandstone, and dolostone are recorded in some flows.  Mafic to intermediate volcaniclastic rocks range from volcanic siltstone to lapilli- and crystal-bearing volcanic sandstones and to pebble-, cobble-, and boulder-conglomerate, and breccia. Siltstones are massive to planar or undulatory laminated, whereas the coarser grained volcaniclastic rocks are generally massive. Rounded pillow fragments are present in some beds whereas in others the clasts are angular and their boundaries may show a jig-saw fit relationship to nearby fragments. Clasts of sedimentary rock, especially dolostone are common in many of the coarse-grained volcaniclastics.  Felsic volcaniclastic rocks range from siliceous siltstone to massive or laminated felsic volcanic sandstone. Evans et al. (2003) sampled a clast-supported, non-welded rhyolitic to rhyodacitic pumice breccia-sandstone from the June Hill area. They report that the clast population comprises mainly feldspar, quartz-phyric pumice clasts, and crystal fragments, principally made up of quartz, plagioclase, and orthoclase.  Sedimentary rocks include siltstone, quartzofeldspathic sandstone, poorly sorted conglomerate, and stromatolitic dolostone. Most conglomerates are poorly sorted, polymictic, and are either clast- or matrix-supported. The dolostones are jaspilitic in places.","The range of volcanic and non-volcanic rock types in the June Hill Volcanics suggests that the formation was deposited in a coastal to shallow marine setting. Pillow lava, mafic breccia, showing jig-saw fit (hyaloclastite) textures, and the interbedded stromatolitic dolostone and siltstone were probably deposited in a shallow submarine environment. Beds of sandstone and poorly sorted polymictic conglomerate may have formed during periods of limited volcanic activity when the volcanic pile and associated non-volcanic sediments were eroded. Coarse-grained, proximal volcanic facies are abundant near June Hill and suggest that this area was close to the main eruptive centre.",,120,,"The June Hill Volcanics have a conformable, gradational lower contact with the Duck Creek Dolomite and a disconformable upper contact with the Ashburton Formation.",,17,,,,4,,,,1799,,1799,,"Several attempts have been made to determine the age of the June Hill Volcanics since the 1960s. The most reliable of these suggest the formation was deposited at c. 1799 Ma.  Evans et al. (2003) obtained a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 1799 Â± 8 Ma from a pumice-breccia sandstone within the locally developed June Hill Volcanics that underlies the Ashburton Formation on WYLOO (1:250 000). This age for the June Hill Volcanics is considered more reliable than the value of 1843 Â± 2 Ma, obtained by Pidgeon and Horwitz, (1991). This is because the latter is based on a multigrain analysis that appears to include an inherited zircon component (Evans et al., 2003). The c. 1799 Ma age is also within the uncertainty of the 1795 Â± 7 Ma age reported by Wilson et al. (2010) from the same unit.  The results of Rb-Sr whole rock geochronology for the June Hill Volcanics were presented by Leggo et al. (1965) who obtained a Rb-Sr model age of c. 1811 Ma from a tuffaceous siltstone from the June Hill area and Compston and Arriens (1968), who recorded a model age of 1977 Â± 165 Ma from an acid porphyry in the Deepdale area.

Most outcrops of the Kaarnka Group lie within a discrete north-northwesterly trending oval basin interpreted as marking the extent of a caldera (Smithies et al., 2013) in the northwestern part of the Talbot Sub-basin. The Kaarnka Group is typically characterized by massive to flow-banded, feldspar(-quartz)-phyric rhyolite and intercalations of crystal-rich to crystal-poor ignimbrite, with lesser siliciclastic rocks (including minor interbeds containing microbial laminites), and minor basalt flows. Conservative estimates on the age range for magmatic activity within the Talbot Sub-basin are between c. 1077 and c. 1047 Ma.","The Mesoproterozoic Bentley Supergroup (Daniels, 1974) comprises weakly to moderately deformed and metamorphosed bimodal volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks and fine- to coarse-grained sedimentary rocks, and unconformably overlies high-grade metamorphic rocks of the west Musgrave Province. In the region extending between Warburton to the west and Barrow Range (approximately 40 km southwest of Jameson Community) to the east, outcrops of the Bentley Supergroup define the Talbot Sub-basin (a component of the Bentley Basin). Most outcrops of the Kaarnka Group lie within a discrete north-northwesterly trending oval basin regarded as marking the extent of a caldera (Smithies et al., 2013) in the northwestern part of the Talbot Sub-basin, extending across the MOUNT EVELINE and BENTLEY map sheets.","The name Kaarnka is the local indigenous (Ngaanyatjarra) word for  crow . The term Kaarnka Group was first used by Werner et al. (2012).  Daniels (1974) divided the Bentley Supergroup into four main stratigraphic units: the Pussy Cat, Tollu, Cassidy, and Mission Groups. Outcrop of the Tollu Group is almost entirely restricted to an east-trending, synclinal structure (Blackstone Syncline and the Blackstone Sub-basin) south of BLACKSTONE, whereas the other groups are restricted to the region between Warburton to the west and the Barrow Range to the east, in what is referred to as the Talbot Sub-basin. In addition, Daniels (1974) recognized three regions dominated by felsic volcanic rocks and intruded by subvolcanic granite; these rocks were referred to as the Scamp, Palgrave, and Skirmish Hill volcanic associations. Each of these regions was thought to outline a fault-bounded caldera. Subsequent mapping redefined the Palgrave volcanic association as the Mount Palgrave Group, which underlies the Pussy Cat Group (Howard et al., 2011). Since then, the Mount Palgrave Group has been divided. The upper part now forms the Kaarnka Group and the lower part has been combined with rocks formerly assigned to the Scamp volcanic association, forming a redefined Mount Palgrave Group.",,"Most outcrops of the Kaarnka Group lie within a discrete north-northwesterly trending oval basin interpreted by Smithies et al. (2013) as marking the extent of a caldera in the northwestern part of the Talbot Sub-basin. At several localities, the ring-structures that help define the caldera structures are expressed in outcrop as subvolcanic porphyritic rhyolite intrusions. Most major successions or lithological packages can be traced throughout the basin or main caldera structure, except for a sequence of interlayered fine- to medium-grained siliciclastic rocks and volcaniclastic rhyolitic lapilli tuffs that form the uppermost unit in the southern lobe of the basin. However, individual layers can be very discontinuous, and the orientations of primary planar structures (e.g. flow banding) vary greatly over short distances. Such chaotic architecture is not a notable feature of the volcanic successions of the underlying Mount Palgrave Group or of the overlying Cassidy Group, and reflects extensive block rotation related to violent proximal volcanic eruptions and caldera formation. The combined stratigraphic thickness of the Kaarnka Group is estimated to be about 3.2 km.  The Kaarnka Group is typically characterized by massive to flow-banded, feldspar(-quartz)-phyric rhyolite and intercalations of crystal-rich to crystal-poor ignimbrite, with lesser siliciclastic rocks (including minor interbeds containing microbial laminites), and minor basalt flows. The flow-banded rhyolite and lesser dacite are found at all stratigraphic levels of the group, and have the appearance of coherent volcanic units. Many examples represent either lavas or subvolcanic sills. However, in some units, the abundance and size of phenocrysts is quite variable, there are fiamme-like features, and there are transitional contacts with bedded depositional units that suggest a pyroclastic origin.  The basal unit on the Kaarnka Group is typically a diamictic rock that most likely formed as a pyroclastic breccia deposit. Epiclastic rocks also occur near the base of the group and become less common with increasing stratigraphic height. They consist of dark-coloured mudstones, sandstones, and conglomerates. Bedding surfaces of sandstones locally show wave ripples. These epiclastic rocks are typically very poorly sorted and are probably composed almost entirely of locally derived felsic-mafic volcanogenic detritus, including reworked pyroclastic material. The boundaries between larger epiclastic horizons and overlying rhyolitic volcanic and volcaniclastic intervals are commonly gradational, and are characterized by the lenticular geometries of depositional bodies, for example rhyolite intercalations several metres thick and tens of metres long in mudstone-dominated sedimentary rocks.  A distinctive and regionally continuous quartz-porphyritic rhyolite lies within the lower part of the Kaarnka Group. This rhyolite contains abundant subrounded quartz phenocrysts, to 8 mm, and subhedral to euhedral feldspar phenocrysts. Phenocryst and groundmass grain size is very inhomogeneous on the outcrop scale; in rare cases crude grain-size sorting occurs and fiamme are locally common. It is clear that this unit includes at least some pyroclastic deposits; however, lavas and very high-level sill or cryptodomes may also occur.  Feldspar- and quartz-porphyritic volcaniclastic units appear at the lower to middle stratigraphic levels of the Kaarnka Group and dominate the upper stratigraphic levels. They consist of interbedded ignimbrites, including crystal-ash and crystal-rich tuffs, and are locally interlayered with flow-banded rhyolitic lavas, subvolcanic sills or lava-like rheomorphic ignimbrites. In places, these rocks appear massive, although they more commonly range from vaguely stratified to graded (fining-upward sequences) or layered crystal-rich to ash-rich tuffs. Graded units can be stacked as individual 1-10 m thick cycles each representing separate pyroclastic pulses. The crystal component of the ignimbrite is typically dominated by subhedral to euhedral feldspar (K-feldspar > plagioclase) ranging up to 5 mm (in rare cases to 1 cm) in size although it also includes abundant subhedral to rounded quartz crystals to 5 mm. At one locality, the crystal tuff contains rare, dark-grey, concentrically laminated accretionary lapilli. Some outcrop areas are also characterized by rhyolitic breccias, including autoclastic breccias and ourstanding exposures of volcaniclastic talus and debris avalanche deposits. Basaltic lavas are also discontinuously preserved throughout this stratigraphic level, and typically show well-developed peperitic contacts with bounding siliciclastic and volcaniclastic layers.  Intrusive rocks within the Mount Palgrave Group comprise sheets and irregular small bodies of subvolcanic porphyritic rhyolite, quartz diorite, as well as dolerite. The subvolcanic porphyritic rhyolite intrusions are very similar to those that intrude likely ring-fractures related to caldera formation in the Kaarnka region. They also preferentially intrude into mudstone-dominated intercalations, and commonly carry abundant mudstone xenoliths of various sizes. The subvolcanic porphyritic rhyolite intrusions define a broad northeast-trending zone linking the Winburn Granite with subvolcanic porphyritic rhyolite intrusions in the Pussy Cat Group to the southwest.

Together, the phenocryst and lithic components can form up to 50% of the rock, although amounts of <20% are most common. Phenocrysts commonly show strong dissolution embayments. Rare clots of green biotite are possibly relict clinopyroxene crystals, and magnetite forms phenocrysts up to 1 mm long, typically surrounded by titanite. The groundmass is dusted with magnetite and ranges in texture from felsitic to radiating masses of unresolvable mineralogy to an extremely fine-grained and very poorly sorted assemblage of quartz, feldspar, and green to green-brown biotite and blue-green amphibole.

It consists of metamorphosed rhyolitic-dacitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks interbedded with minor banded iron formation and banded chert. The total thickness is approximately 1 km (Ivanic et al., 2017); this is a minimum estimate, since the top contacts are not visible. A rhyolite from this unit has been dated at 2813 Â± 3 Ma (Nelson, 2001), interpreted to be the age of igneous crystallization. The basal parts of the Kantie Murdanna Volcanics Member are intruded by dolerites of the roof zone of the Windimurra Igneous Complex, hence the base of this member is interpreted to be roof pendants of the Windimurra Igneous Complex (Ivanic et al., 2010). Though this basal portion predates the roof zone, it is possible that some of the overlying volcanic rocks were deposited contemporaneously, or even after intrusion of the complex. Geochemically this member is a fractionated tholeiitic rock, and similar in composition to other members of the Yaloginda Formation (Ivanic et al., 2012).","The principal exposure of this unit is within the extent of the Windimurra Igneous Complex on CHALLA and WINDIMURRA. It forms a 30 km long and 8 km wide, north-northeast trending expanse. The limit of this expanse is defined by the basal contact of the volcanic rocks with the roof zone of the Windimurra Igneous Complex, the outcrop of which mantles the volcanic rocks.",The Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member is named after Kantie Murdana Hill. This is located at the north-eastern corner of CHALLA (MGA Zone 50 645020E 6889485N).,,"Felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks comprise the majority of the Kantie Murdanna Volcanics Member and thin but ubiquitous horizons of banded iron formation and banded chert are a minor component. Coherent felsic volcanic rocks are mainly rhyolite to dacite with quartz and feldspar phenocrysts (up to 6 mm in diameter). A large portion of this unit is metarhyolite (A-NOyk-mfe), which was likely coherent rhyolite lava that is now entirely recrystallized to a granular texture. There are also many horizons and some thick packages of volcaniclastic rocks, including bedded tuffaceous units and volcaniclastic breccias, locally well-preserved.  Volcaniclastic units (A-NOyk-frt) typically have 10-50 cm sized angular clasts of coherent lava in a sand-sized matrix (e.g. TJIWIN100033, Zone 50, MGA 647207E68879801N), which are locally sheared. Larger scale volcanic features such as columnar jointing are also present  in several exposures (Ahmat, 1986) indicating 10-20 m thick lava flows. Also, interlayering of units on a 20m thickness scale has been observed (TJIWIN090408, Zone 50, MGA 646486E 6893080N).   Metamorphism of the Kantie Murdanna Volcanics Member is extensive and much of the volcanic rock is recrystallized into an equigranular metamorphic rock composed of quartz, albite, chlorite and muscovite (e.g. at site TJIWIN090477, Zone 50, MGA 648533E 6894405N). Throughout outcrops of the volcanic rocks of the member, there are abundant shear zones <1 m wide showing a steeply-dipping, north-south oriented fabric of flattened and often elongate quartz crystals. Deformation appears to have post-dated the phase of equigranular recrystallization as equigranular rocks can be seen to be variably strained. Folds are also evident especially with the banded iron formations and these are typically tight to open synforms with steeply-dipping, north-south oriented axial planes and moderately south-dipping hinges. Locally, and particularly near to the north-trending faults, the folds have sheared limbs (e.g. at site TJIWIN090499, Zone 50, MGA 636117E 6877682N).","The Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member may have been deposited in a large basinal structure ~100 km in diameter, focussed above the Windimurra Igneous Complex (Ivanic, 2016). This basin was likely a fault bounded caldera, the subsidence of which was generated by extension and/or magma chamber deflation during eruptions. The absence of significant clast rounding in volcaniclastic rocks may indicate that these basins were dominantly submarine and at times relatively quiescent, allowing cyclical precipitiation of tens of metres of thickness of banded iron formations.",1500,,,"The basal parts of the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member overlie a quench-textured dolerite of the roof zone of the Windimurra Igneous Complex.

The lower part is a typically densely welded, strongly flow-banded to eutaxitic, rhyolitic rheoignimbrite.

",,17,,,,4,,,,1077,,1047,,"The basal contact of the Pussy Cat Group is a locally faulted, although conformable, contact with the Mount Waugh Formation at the top of the Mount Palgrave Group. Thus, a date of 1065 Â± 9 Ma (GSWA 195230; GSWA, preliminary data) obtained directly from a sample of the Mount Waugh Formation possibly represents the maximum age constraint on the deposition of rocks of the Pussy Cat Group. The upper contact of the Pussy Cat Group with the overlying Wururu Rhyolite of the Cassidy Group is conformable. A date of 1065 Â± 5 Ma (GSWA 174690, Kirkland et al., 2011a) obtained directly from a sample of the Wururu Rhyolite possibly represents the minimum age constraint on the deposition of rocks of the Pussy Cat Group. Where the Kathleen Ignimbrite is not in intrusive contact with the feldspar-porphyritic rhyolite, these contacts with volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks are locally peperitic, indicating that the entire depositional sequence was essentially synchronous. However, although a 1062 Â± 8 Ma date (GSWA 195001; GSWA, preliminary data) obtained from feldspar-porphyritic rhyolite underlying the Kathleen Ignimbrite is consistent with the minimum and maximum age bracket of the Pussy Cat Group, older dates from the ignimbrite itself (1071 Â± 5 Ma; GSWA 195723; GSWA, preliminary data) and from feldspar-porphyritic rhyolite that overlies it (1076 Â± 5 Ma; GSWA 195031; GSWA, preliminary data; and 1078 Â± 5 Ma; GSWA 195058; GSWA, preliminary data) are at the older extreme of, or exceed, that age bracket. This highlights a problem common to dating of all igneous rocks of the Talbot Sub-basin.  It is likely that the dates from these rocks represent the mean age of zircon crystallization, including that of locally abundant antecrysts, but not the age of magmatic crystallization of those rocks. Rather, crystal-laden (including zircon) magma resided in a near-solidus state in subvolcanic chambers for several millions of years (from c. 1075 Ma) before being remobilized and erupted (Kathleen Ignimbrite) or intruded (feldspar-porphyritic rhyolite). Evidence for this is found in the textures of the zircon crystals, which have complex magmatic zoning, and dissolution and regrowth patterns from magmas with very different Th and U concentrations. It is now recognized that all felsic igneous rocks of the Talbot Sub-basin include a large proportion of recycled cognate material (i.e. antecrysts). The unavoidable inclusion of these in the dated zircon samples means that all previously interpreted crystallization ages have likely been variably overestimated (i.e. true ages of volcanic deposition or intrusive crystallization should be younger). Smithies et al. (2013) suggested that the most conservative age range for magmatic activity within the Talbot Sub-basin is probably between c. 1077 and c. 1047 Ma although dating of individual zircons interpreted to be antecrysts indicates a maximum possible range from 1116 Â± 28 to 1010 Â± 20 Ma.",No,,,3,,No,Published,No,Yes,P_,PUk,,,,,MIGSDAR,2.01E+13,2.01E+13,No,No

The distribution of the Kazput Formation within the Hardey Syncline is strongly controlled by erosional truncation by the unconformities at the base of the Munder and Anthiby Formations in the Turee Creek Group, and by the overlying Beasley River Quartzite.","The Kazput Formation as currently defined (Thorne and Tyler, 1996) is equivalent to the  unnamed carbonate and shale ,  unnamed quartzite unit 2  and the lower part of  unnamed quartzite unit 3  as originally defined by Trendall (1979). Detailed mapping of the Hardey Syncline by Martin et al. (2000) recognised that the upper part of  unnamed quartzite unit 3  locally equates to the Beasley River Quartzite, and that the Kazput Formation as mapped at the time contains an unconformity-bound upper unit, here named the Anthiby Formation (P_-TKn-sf). Thorne and Tyler (1996) did not recognise the Anthiby Formation, including it in the Beasley River Quartzite, and also did not recognise the newly defined Munder Formation (P_-TKm-sp) which comprises the coarse-grained siliciclastic component of the originally defined Kazput Formation. The Kazput Formation derives its name from Kazput Pool (Zone 50, MGA 519500E 7459000N) on the Hardey River on ROCKLEA, about 24 km southeast of the type area (around Zone 50, MGA 497000E 7468000N).

The lower Kazput formation is about 350 m thick and consists predominantly of siltstone, dolomitic siltstone, massive recrystallised dolomite, stromatolitic dolomite, fine-grained sandstone, and rare thin beds of iron formation. Fine grained siliciclastic and carbonate lithologies display planar- and ripple-lamination, whereas sandstones display ripple- and hummocky cross-stratification. Carbonate lithologies are also locally hummocky cross-stratified, and contain wavy, domal and microdigitate stromatolitic textures as well as intraclasts and soft-sediment deformation features. A detailed facies analysis, including carbon isotope chemostratigraphy and a brief discussion of stromatolite morphology, has been conducted by Martindale et al. (2015). The upper Kazput Formation is characterized by coarse-grained siliciclastic rocks that contain distinctive jaspilite grains and clasts. The larger clasts preserve textures that have been interpreted to record erosion of the distinctive jaspilites of the Weeli Woli Formation in the underlying Hamersley Group (Martin et al., 2000). This unit is dominated by upward-fining trough cross-stratified sedimentation units that are characteristically ferruginous and record unimodal paleocurrent directions towards the northeast (Martin et al., 2000). The upper Kazput Formation is estimated to be about 300 m thick but this thickness varies depending on the amount of erosion at the base of the Anthiby Formation, which locally rests on the Kungarra Formation.","The lower Kazput Formation is interpreted to have been deposited on a shallow marine, mixed carbonate-siliciclastic shelf (Martindale et al., 2015).

Where the Strelley Pool Formation is absent, the Kelly Group overlies the Warrawoona Group across an erosional unconformity (Hickman, 2008). The Kelly Group is overlain by sedimentary rocks of the 3270-3235 Ma Sulphur Springs Group across an erosional unconformity (Van Kranendonk, 2000).   The basal formation of the Kelly Group is the Euro Basalt, which in some areas consists of a lower unit of komatiite up to 1500 m thick overlain by up to 7000 m of komatiitic and tholeiitic basalt. Thin chert units are present at intervals within the basaltic succession. Basaltic volcanism was followed by eruption of the 3325-3315 Ma Wyman Formation, which is composed of metamorphosed rhyolite lava and volcaniclastic rocks, and intrusive porphyritic rhyolite. Komatiitic basalt, up to 1000 m thick, locally separates rhyolite units of the Wyman Formation establishing the co-existence of mafic and felsic volcanic activity at 3315 Ma. Metamorphosed shale and chert at the top of the Wyman Formation are locally accompanied by beds of barite and domal stromatolites (Williams and Bagas, 2007).

369,9572,P_-KM-xsz-bb,1,Kimberley Group,1,Quartz sandstone and feldspathic sandstone; siltstone and mudstone; basalt; minor dolostone and conglomerate,"The Paleoproterozoic Kimberley Group is a >4 km thick package of thick-bedded, quartz-dominated sandstone with subordinate feldspathic sandstone, siltstone and mafic volcanic rocks deposited into the aerially extensive Kimberley Basin, northern Western Australia. The group is split into two informal divisions. The lower Kimberley Group consists of the basal King Leopold Sandstone conformably overlain by the Carson Volcanics. Sedimentary units are abundantly cross-bedded. Mafic volcanism is restricted to the Carson Volcanics and consists of massive to amygdaloidal basalt intercalated with quartzofeldspathic sandstone and siltstone. In the Yampi Fold Belt the Carson Volcanics consist of thick packages of the volcaniclastic rocks and breccia beds probably indicating proximity to a volcanic centre. The lower Kimberley Group is extensively intruded by sills of the Hart Dolerite which have SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages of 1799-1791 Ma (Sheppard et al., 2012; Wingate et al., in prep). Sills of the Hart Dolerite and lavas of the Carson Volcanics are considered to be contiguous and constitute the Hart-Carson Large Igneous Province with a combined volume of about 250 000 km 3 . This places a maximum depositional age of c. 1795 Ma for much of the lower Kimberley Group.  The upper Kimberley Group consists of the Warton Sandstone, Elgee Siltstone, Pentecost Sandstone and Yampi Formation, mostly conformable within the subgroup and conformable on the lower Kimberley Group. These formations consist of thick-bedded, abundantly cross-bedded, quartz-dominated sandstone with minor feldspathic sandstone and siltstone. The upper Kimberley Group is likewise intruded by mafic sills that may not be Hart Dolerite but may be related to a younger magmatic event. The Elgee Siltstone is intruded by the Wotjulum Porphyry in the Yampi Sound area which yields a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of c. 1740 Ma and is considered as a maximum depositional age for the sedimentary rocks in the upper Kimberley Group.","The Kimberley Group dominates the exposed rocks of the Kimberley region, northern Western Australia. The margins of the basin are defined by the northeast-trending Halls Creek Orogen and northwest-trending King Leopold Orogen.",,,"The Kimberley Group is dominated by very thick- and thick-bedded, abundantly cross-bedded, fine- to medium-grained, quartz-dominated sandstone with subordinate feldspathic sandstone, siltstone and mafic volcanic/volcaniclastic rocks. Rare lithologies include conglomerate, pebbly sandstone, dolomitic sandstone and siltstone and chert.  The basal formation is the King Leopold Sandstone which can be up to 1800 m thick. This formation is dominated by white, buff or pale brown, very thick-bedded and thick-bedded, quartz-dominated sandstone. Commonly beds are >1 m thick. Sandstone compositions are dominantly quartz arenite (>95% quartz) but uncommon feldspathic beds are subarkose in composition with <20% feldspar. The King Leopold Sandstone is well- to moderately sorted and strongly silica cemented with little to no preserved matrix. Silicification of the King Leopold Sandstone has been so extensive that many primary sedimentary structures are obscured. Faint cross-bedding is seen along with less common planar parallel laminations and overturned cross-bedding. The formation is dominated by fine- to medium-grained quartz sandstone. Fine-grained material is rare and restricted to silt-grade quartz, clay minerals and heavy minerals in cross-laminations. Pebbly quartz sandstone beds < 1 m thick are observed throughout the formation. A <50 cm thick conglomerate is observed near the base of the formation. It is poorly-sorted, clast-supported and monomictic consisting of granule and pebble subrounded and rounded clasts of quartz.  The Carson Volcanics conformably overlie the King Leopold Sandstone. The formation has a recorded maximum thickness of 1140 m thick and consists of mafic volcanic units intercalated with siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. Volcanic units are fine- to medium-grained tholeiitic basalt flows, dominantly coherent flows but commonly with amygdaloidal tops. Amygdales up to 2 cm wide are filled with chlorite, quartz, carbonate or pyrite. Other volcanic lithologies include subordinate agglomerate, breccia and volcaniclastic material. Polygonal joints 5-50 cm wide are characteristic, but do not form columns. Pillow basalts are rare. The Carson Volcanics in the Yampi Fold Belt in the west Kimberley region is dominated by thick packages of volcaniclastic material with peperitic contacts between volcanically derived units and ambient sedimentary rocks. The number and thickness of the lava flows is variable throughout the Kimberley Basin. Up to seven separate lava flows have been identified. Basalts are intercalated with medium-bedded, very fine- or fine-grained quartzofeldspathic sandstone and siltstone. These sedimentary interbeds are variable in thickness and lateral extent. They are commonly <30 cm to >1 m thick and are discontinuous forming beds that may pinch and swell up to 10 km along strike. Sedimentary structures recorded include abundant cross-bedding, planar laminations and symmetrical ripples as well as less common desiccation cracks. A zone of quartz-epidote alteration affects both volcanic and sedimentary unis of the Carson Volcanics in the north Kimberley region in outcrops south of Kalumburu. Thin stromatolitic cherts are also observed towards the top of the Carson Volcanics in the north Kimberley. Stromatolites are not observed in the exposures in the south Kimberley or Yampi Fold Belt; however, possible microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS) are recorded from some siltstone units northwest of Bedford Downs Homestead.  The Warton Sandstone is up to 900 m thick and conformably overlies the Carson Volcanics. The formation is dominated by medium-grained, well-sorted, quartz-dominated sandstone with subordinate feldspathic sandstone (subarkose and arkose) and minor siltstone. Sandstone beds are abundantly cross-bedded with foresets 30-100 cm thick. Other sedimentary structures include symmetrical ripples and ripple laminations, planar parallel laminations as well as less common water escape structures, flaser bedding and desiccation cracks. The basal Warton Sandstone is usually a cliff-forming, very thick-bedded unit with little to no matrix. This marks a distinct change from the thin- or medium-bedded heterolithic feldspathic sandstone and siltstone units at the top of the Carson Volcanics. An upper division of the Warton Sandstone has been recognised in the west Kimberley region on the PRINCE REGENT-CAMDEN SOUND 1:250 000 map sheet. Here the Buckland Point Member is marked by interbedded white quartz-dominated sandstone and red-brown ferruginous sandstone and siltstone.  The Elgee Siltstone is up to 480 m thick and conformably overlies the Warton Sandstone. The formation is a heterolithic package of red or brown, thin-bedded, massive or planar parallel laminated micaceous siltstone and claystone interbedded with fine-grained quartzofeldspathic sandstone. Green or grey reduction spots and layers are seen in siltstone beds. The Ternois Member of the Elgee Siltstone is a 30 m thick basal dolomitic unit which consists of dolomitic sandstone and siltstone, oolitic sandstone and interbedded siliciclastic sandstone and siltstone. The dolomitic units may be found with microbialites including stromatolites, microbial mats and MISS. Minor copper mineralisation has been recorded form the Teronis Member and has been remobilised through some of the Elgee Siltstone. The thickness of the Elgee Siltstone as well as the sandstone to siltstone ratio increases up section and to the southwest.  The Pentecost Sandstone is up to 1375 m thick and conformably overlies the Elgee Siltstone. The formation has been informally divided into a lower, middle and upper unit. The lower unit is made of thick-bedded and cross-bedded quartz sandstone and minor feldspathic sandstone containing horizons with clay pellet intraclasts and shale-pellet conglomerates. The base of the middle unit is marked by grey-green, thin-bedded, glauconitic or otherwise cupriferous, sandstone and siltstone. The bulk of the middle unit is composed of either feldspathic or quartz sandstone and ferruginous-glauconitic sandstone. The upper unit has only been observed in the north Kimberley and is marked by medium- or coarse-grained quartz sandstones and granule- to pebble-sandstones.  The Yampi Formation is only described from the west Kimberly region in coastal outcrops from Yampi Sound to Collier Bay. The Yampi Formation has been correlative with the upper unit of the Pentecost Sandstone in the east Kimberley region. The formation consists of quartzofeldspathic sandstone and hematite-bearing quartz sandstone. On Koolan Island the formation is up to 900 m thick, unconformable on the Warton Sandstone and consists of quartz-hematite sandstone with economic grades of 66-67% hematite.","The volumetric majority of Kimberley Group lithofacies were probably deposited within tidal influence. Tidal settings are evidenced from sedimentary structures like bimodal paleocurrent directions, flaser bedding, and evidence for subaerial exposure including desiccation cracks, salt casts, and rain drop prints.  The basal King Leopold Sandstone is probably a fluviomarine deposit. Medium- to coarse-grained quartz-dominated sandstone, cross-bedding, poor to moderate sorted and a distinctive conglomerate suggest that the lower formation was deposited in a broad fluvial plain or deltaic setting with common marine incursions. Improving sorting and fining up section probably indicates the prevalence of the shallow marine setting. The Carson Volcanics represent continued sedimentation in the Kimberley Basin synchronous with emplacement and extrusion of the Hart-Carson Large Igneous Province at c. 1795 Ma. Subaqueous lava extrusion is evidenced by pillow basalts. Basalt was emplace onto and burrowed into wet sediment evidenced by peperite with sedimentation taking place in a marginal marine setting, evidenced by abundant symmetrical ripples, low angle cross-bedded sandstone and siltstone and desiccation cracks at all stratigraphic intervals across the basin. Sedimentary units are not continuous but pinch and swell over 10s m to 10s km. This suggests a relatively flat topography controlled by the voluminous basalt with numerous flooding episodes covering the volcanic plain. The dominance of volcaniclastic rocks and breccia in the Yampi Fold Belt in the west Kimberley indicate proximity to a volcanic centre in this area. Stromatolitic chert at the top of the Caron Volcanics probably represents supratidal conditions and possibly a series of hot springs and a large hydrothermal system concomitant with the dearth of volcanic activity in the Kimberley Basin.  The sharp contact between the marginal marine Carson Volcanics and demonstrably lower shore to possibly offshore sandy shelf in the Warton Sandstone suggests a basin-wide marine transgression. This increase in relative sea level is probably due to subsidence of the Kimberley Basin in response to the cessation of volcanic activity. Ubiquitous planar cross-bedding infers a high current energy setting between fair-weather and storm-wave base. Flaser bedding and desiccation cracks in some beds in the Warton Sandstone infer shallowing and subaerial exposure. The Elgee Siltstone, a regressive formation deposited along the shoreline of the Kimberley Basin. The basal Teronis Member is a dolomitic and locally stromatolitic unit deposited in a supratidal to intertidal setting. Carbonate deposition was probably sabka-style. The upper Elgee Siltstone is an intertidal to shallow marine siliciclastic unit. The Elgee is transgressed by the Pentecost Sandstone which marks open marine sedimentation across the entire Kimberley Basin. Again, horizons with desiccation cracks suggest periodic subaerial exposure. The Yampi Formation has been interpreted as a placer style beach deposit indicating proximity to the paleoshoreline are inferred from reworked heavy mineral sandstone (Tyler and Griffin, 1993). The volumetric majority of Kimberley Group rocks consist of well- to moderately sorted, clean, quartz-dominated sandstones and interbedded feldspathic sandstones. The compositional ubiquity indicates that the material was sourced from a continental, probably granitic hinterland and possibly from some reworked sedimentary terranes. Constant reworking of quartzofeldspathic sediment in nearshore settings would result in the textural and mineralogical maturity and the dominance of rounded, quartz-dominated grain populations. Paleocurrent data suggest that the source was from the northeast to north-northwest, beyond the present Kimberley Basin. ",,4000,,"The Kimberley Group is unconformable or disconformable on the Speewah Group. Griffin et al. (1993) noted that near Bold Bluff in the King Leopold Ranges, the King Leopold Sandstone was unconformable on the O Donnell Formation (basal Speewah Group). In most other locations where the contact is exposed, the Kimberley Group is disconformable on the Speewah Group or rests on it with a low angle unconformity. In the central and east Kimberley region the Kimberley Group rests unconformably on basement rocks of the Lamboo Province.  The Kimberley Group conformably to unconformably overlain by the Bastion and Crowhurst Groups. In the Cockburn Ranges the Bastion Group is seemingly conformable on the Kimberley Group and may be part of the same sedimentary package. The Neoproterozoic Mount House and Louisa Downs Groups unconformably overlie the upper Kimberley Group.  The Hart Dolerite intrudes the Kimberley Basin at all stratigraphic levels, but particularly the lower Kimberley Group in the west Kimberley region where it forms anastomosing sills in the King Leopold Sandstone and Carson Volcanics.

370,9602,P_-KMl-st,4610,King Leopold Sandstone,1,"White to pale-brown, medium- to coarse-grained quartz sandstone and pebbly quartz sandstone; minor siltstone and granule to pebble conglomerate","The King Leopold Sandstone is a thick and widely outcropping unit that makes prominent cliffs and ridges as well as aerially extensive plateaus in the west and central Kimberley region. The formation also outcrops as a thinner unit on the upturned margin of the northeast-trending Halls Creek Orogen. The King Leopold Sandstone is the basal formation of the Paleoproterozoic Kimberley Group. The formation unconformably or disconformably overlies the older Speewah Group. The King Leopold Sandstone is volumetrically dominated by white, buff, or pale brown, thick-bedded, well- to moderately sorted, quartz-dominated sandstone. The dominant lithology is quartz arenite (>95% quartz). The formation is strongly silicified and silica-cemented producing orthoquartzite. Due to the intense silicification primary sedimentary structures are faint or overprinted. Cross-bedding and planar laminations are common is less silicified outcrops. Subordinate lithofacies include pebbly quartz sandstone, feldspathic sandstone, pebble to rare boulder conglomerate, silty sandstone and rare siltstone and shale. Pebbly sandstone beds are coarse-grained quartz arenite beds are recorded throughout the formation but are particularly common with an interbedded cobble and boulder conglomerate near the base of the formation. The conglomerate is commonly monomictic with clasts of rounded vein quartz and subordinate sandstone and siltstone. The lower King Leopold Sandstone was probably deposited in a broad fluvial plain with increasing marine influence up section to the shallow marine, well-sorted sandstone units towards the top of the formation. The Hart Dolerite extensively intruded the King Leopold Sandstone at all stratigraphic levels. A granophyre in the dolerite yields an average SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 1795 Â± 15 Ma which can be used as a maximum depositional age for the formation.","The King Leopold Sandstone is thick and widespread unit throughout the Kimberley region covering an area of about 36,606 km 2 . The formation is forms high cliffs and ridges and is particularly well-exposed in the King Leopold Ranges, Edkins Range as well as the Gardner Plateau which covers a large portion of the west Kimberley. The King Leopold Sandstone is exposed as a thinner unit on the northeast-trending margin of the Halls Creek Orogen where it is exposed in the Durack Ranges.",The King Leopold Sandstone is named for the King Leopold Ranges where the formation crops out extensively and from where it was first described. This range itself was named in 1879 by the surveyor Alexander Forrest after King Leopold II of Belgium.,,"Several distinct lithofacies have been described from the King Leopold Sandstone but are highly localised. The volumetric majority of the formation consists of white, buff, or pale brown, very thick- to thick-bedded, medium- to coarse-grained, well- to moderately-sorted, cross-bedded or massive, highly recrystallised (and silica cemented), quartz-dominated sandstones (quartz arenite or orthoquartzite). In some locations the feldspar content increases to produce several beds of subarkose and arkose (i.e. at CXPLSN000145 at the extreme southwest end of the Durack Range on BEDFORD 1:100 000, CXPCHN000260 where the Gibb River Road cuts through the Phillips Range on PACKHORSE RANGE 1:100 000, and by Gellatly and Sofoulis (1969) in the north Kimberley region on DRYSDALE-LONDONDERRY 1:250 000 map sheet). One common feature seen across the entire formation is the extent of recrystallization. The King Leopold Sandstone has a sugary texture as a result of regrowth and recrystallization of quartz (producing orthoquartzite). Consequently, the sandstones are dominantly massive with sedimentary structures poorly preserved but normal grading has been observed in some outcrops as well as some cross-bedding and cross-laminations (i.e. CXPLSN000145). Subrounded to rounded hollows, 5-20 cm wide and up to 10 cm high, are observed (CXPLSN000145). They are either observed alone or in bedding-parallel, discontinuous layers. These features are probably weathered out intraclasts, probably originally filled with siltstone, but any trace of the primary filling material has been weathered.  The base of the formation contains a thick-bedded, poorly-sorted, matrix- and clast-supported, polymictic pebble or boulder conglomerate. Clasts of quartz and quartz-dominated sandstone up to 1 m in diameter are present within the conglomerate in the Mount Bedford area of the east Kimberley region (BEDFORD 1:100 000; Williams, 2005; Schmidt and Williams, 2008). Some authors (Williams, 2005; Schmidt and Williams, 2008) have suggested that the basal conglomerates between Lansdowne and Bedford Downs Homesteads on LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 map sheets are diamictites of glacial origin. Further to this the low angle unconformity between the Speewah and Kimberley Groups (termed the Bedford Surface by Williams (2005) represents an episode of glacial with sculpted forms such as linear grooves produced by subglaical meltwater. A thin basal quartz-pebble conglomerate is also described on LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 by Griffin et al. (1993) where it is interbedded with 50 cm thick intervals of black shale. A glacial origin was not proposed for these conglomerates. Polymictic pebble conglomerates and pebbly sandstones are also described from the upper part of the formation on MONTAGUE SOUND by Allen (1971).  Minor lithologies include poorly sorted, coarse-grained to gravel sandstone and pebble conglomerate with siltstone partings. Micaceous sandstones are also seen on the ASHTON 1:250 000 map sheet (Derrick, 1968).","Due to the extensive recrystallization obscuring many of the sedimentary structures, a definitive depositional environment cannot be determined for the entire King Leopold Sandstone. Despite this, preserved cross-bedding, planar parallel laminations, and rare intraclasts suggests a high current energy setting with sediment deposited by lamina flow under high flow regime conditions. Some cross-bedding is overturned implying strong bottom currents (Derrick, 1968). The wave-generated symmetrical ripples and deposition of a conglomerate with clasts of polygonal mudstone (Williams, 2005) suggest reworking of a subaerially exposed surface, possibly on a mud plain, support a shallow marine or tidal environment some of the King Leopold. The textural and mineralogical maturity of this formation indicates that the sediment has been reworked many times before final deposition. Such well-sorted, clean quartz-dominated sediments with a high current energy could possibly infer a shallow marine depositional environment like a beach or lower shoreface environment.  Paleoflow indicators (cross-bedding) from the King Leopold Sandstone infer flow from the north-northwest on GORDON DOWNS 1:250 000 (Blake et al., 2000), north and northwest on DRYSDALE-LONDONDERRY 1:250 000 and ASHTON 1:250 000 (Gellatly and Sofoulis, 1969; Derrick, 1968, respectively), from the northwest on MEDUSA BANKS 1:250 000 (Plumb and Perry, 1971), and northeast and northwest on LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967).  The basal conglomerates of the King Leopold Sandstone have been interpreted as a fluvioglacial deposit, passing into a shallow epicontinental sea (Williams, 2005). Purported periglacial frost fissures on the Bedford Surface suggest a mean annual air temperature of < 0 to < -4 &deg;C (Williams, 2005). ",61,1800,,"The King Leopold Sandstone marks the start of continuous and conformable sedimentation within the Kimberley Basin, conformably overlain by the Carson Volcanics. The formation unconformably overlies the Speewah Group throughout most of the Kimberley region, the contact exposed in various locations in the King Leopold and Durack Ranges. The King Leopold Sandstone may also lie unconformably on the older granites of the Paperbark or the Marboo Formation in the western zone of the Lamboo Province or the Sally Downs Supersuite or Koongie Park Formation in the central zone of the Lamboo Province in the east Kimberley region.  The low angle unconformity between the Speewah Group and King Leopold Sandstone (Kimberley Group) marks a hiatus in deposition (time unknown) during which a purported glacial period ensued (the King Leopold Glaciation; Williams, 2005; Schmidt and Williams, 2008).  Neoproterozoic sediments of the Mount House Group (Beverley Springs Member of the Walsh Tillite) unconformably overlie the King Leopold Sandstone in the Synnot Range and near Beverley Springs Homestead in the west Kimberley region.  The Hart Dolerite intrudes the King Leopold Sandstone at all stratigraphic levels and commonly intrudes the contact between the Speewah and Kimberley Groups in the King Leopold Range, west Kimberley region.",,17,,,,4,,,,1814,,1791,,"Detrital zircon geochronology of the King Leopold Sandstone was reported in Kirkland et al. (2010). GSWA 182105 yielded significant age components at c. 2523, 2201, 1999, 1965, 1886 and 1874 Ma with minor age components between 2579-1840 Ma (Kirkland et al., 2010). A weighted mean 207Pb*/206Pb* date of 1869 Â± 7 Ma was obtained from the 15 youngest analyses, however, the age is older than dates obtained from the 1857-1849 Ma Whitewater Volcanics that unconformably underlies the Kimberley Basin (Griffin et al., 2000; Worden et al., 2008; Kirkland et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2016). The age of the King Leopold Sandstone is better constrained by the conformably underlying Speewah Group. Detrital zircon geochronology from the Tunganary Formation in the lower Kimberley Group contained a young detrital zircon age component at 1814 Â± 10 Ma from a population of seven young grains with the youngest detrital zircon dated at 1803 Â± 12 Ma (1&sigma;) (GS11031-2, Ramsay et al., 2017). The age of the youngest population at c. 1814 Ma is therefore considered a best estimate for the maximum age of the Speewah Group and lower Kimberley Group, including the King Leopold Sandstone.  The King Leopold Sandstone is conformably overlain by the volcano-sedimentary Carson Volcanics. Basalt lava in the Carson Volcanics are considered extrusive equivalents of sills in the Hart Dolerite that extensively intrude the Speewah Group and lower Kimberley Group and together constitute the Hart-Carson Large Igneous Province (Sheppard et al., 2012). Sheppard et al. (2012) reported U-Pb ages from a granophyric unit within the Hart Dolerite at 1799 Â± 17 Ma from zircon (GA 8759.8003) and 1795 Â± 15 Ma from baddeleyite (GSWA 113574). A minimum age of 1791 Â± 8 Ma was provided from sample GSWA 206156 by Wingate et al. (in prep).

The matrix is fine to medium grained or coarsely feldspar-phyric with a fine- to very fine-grained groundmass (Stewart, 2004). The dominant matrix minerals are quartz, plagioclase, clinopyroxene and chlorite pseudomorphs, possibly after orthopyroxene (Ahmat, 1984). Much of the quartz and feldspar may be xenocrystic. Minor components include opaque oxide minerals, uralitic amphibole, titanate and carbonate (Peers, 1972). According to Stewart (2004), the host rock is more felsic in the western part of the body, west of Linger and Die Well (Zone 51J, MGA 335870E 6831530N), where it ranges in composition from diorite to monzogranite.   Xenoliths in the King of the Hills Dolerite Member are typically less than one metre across and composed dominantly of quartz with subordinate granite. Clasts vary in shape and size, are commonly rounded, and show common evidence of resorption into the intruding dyke (Thom and Barnes, 1977). They are typically quartz aggregates and granite but there are also many individual quartz and feldspar xenocryst grains.

(1974). Identification of the Kongorow Granite is based on its generally dark colour, high proportion of biotite-rich mafic xenoliths, heterogeneous nature and strong foliation. Some of the variations mapped and described by Derrick and Playford (1973) and Gellatly et al. (1974) have been reinterpreted to be part of other granite units. The Kongorow Granite is essentially a foliated, porphyritic, biotite metamonzogranite. SHRIMP U-Pb zircon date from the Kongorow Granite has yielded an age of 1852 Â± 4 Ma (Griffin et al., 2000).",The Kongorow Granite outcrops in discontinuous and smaller intrusive bodies within the northwest-trending corridor of the Paperbark Supersuite exposures adjacent to the Speewah and Kimberley Basins in the west Kimberley region.,"The Kongorow Granite is named after the Kongorow Pool (Lat. -17&deg; 8' 31'' S, Long. 124&deg; 46' 45'' E) immediately adjacent to the Barker River on the LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 map sheet.

The Kongorow Pool is accessible via a track to the Kongorow Pool mine approximately 24 km off the Gibb River Road.",,"The Kongorow Granite is defined by a suite of biotite-rich, porphyritic granites (Gellatly et al., 1969). The Kongorow Granite on the CHARNLEY 1:250 000 map sheet comprises mainly foliated porphyritic metamonzogranite and metagranodiorite (Gellatly and Halligan, 1971). It includes coarsely banded gneissic granite restricted to narrow (less than 20 m) zones close to the southwest limit of outcrop of the Lamboo Province in the west Kimberley region (e.g. in Barkers Creek; Griffin et al., 1993). The gneissic rocks indicate a complex history of multiple intrusions suggesting that the Kongorow Granite may be one of the earliest units of the Paperbark Supersuite.  The Kongorow Granite is identified by its dark colour and a high proportion of biotite-rich, mafic xenoliths (Griffin et al., 1993). Gellatly and Halligan (1971) noted that the Kongorow Granite contained more biotite but less K-feldspar than the adjacent Lennard Granite in outcrops south of the King Leopold Ranges on the CHARNLEY 1:250 000 map sheet. Exposures of the Kongorow Granite on the YAMPI 1:250 000 map sheet, south of High Range and east of the Table and Wyndham Ranges, are included as compositionally banded phases of the Lennard Granite with large, partly assimilated xenoliths of biotite-rich and banded amphibole (Tyler and Griffin, 1993).  Approximately 3 km southwest of the abandoned Federal Downs Homestead on CHARNLEY, the Kongorow Granite intrudes the Lennard Granite forming a large net-vein complex with up to 12 m blocks of Lennard Granite (Gellatly et al., 1969). The foliation in the blocks of Lennard Granite parallels the foliation in the granite away from the net-vein complex demonstrating minimal rotation during brecciation. Aplite and pegmatite veins and dykes containing black tourmaline are associated with the net-vein complex and aplite selvedges form sharp contacts with the Lennard Granite (Gellatly et al., 1969).",,,,,"The Kongorow Granite intrudes the Whitewater Volcanics west of the Gibb River road, and metasedimentary rocks of the Marboo Formation east of the Van Emmerick Range.

The type section was specified by Thorne and Tyler (1996) as being about 11 km northwest of Koolbye Well (at Zone 50, MGA 503500E 7466750N).",,"In the type section, the base of the formation is marked by thin, discontinuous pebbly sandstone which is overlain by thin- to thick-bedded coarse-grained quartz sandstone. The remainder of the unit is dominated by tabular to lenticular beds of fine- to medium-grained quartz sandstone with thin argillite interbeds, arranged in upward-fining cycles. Four main sandstone-dominated horizons have been recognised in a section measured to the west of the type section (Mazumder et al., 2015) and six sandstone horizons are present in the core of the Meteorite Bore Anticline (at Zone 50, MGA 496350E 7466810N). The sandstones are characterized by small- to large-scale trough cross-stratification, with pebble lags demarcating large scours, as well as parallel planar to undulatory and herringbone lamination, and ripple cross-lamination. Ripple morphologies include straight-crested with tuning fork bifurcation, interference, and current ripples. Fluvial paleocurrent directions measured from trough cross-stratification are predominantly to the northeast whereas bipolar marine paleocurrent directions are oriented roughly east-west (Martin et al., 2000). Mazumder et al. (2015) carried out a detailed facies analysis of the Koolbye Formation and record south-southeasterly paleocurrents in the lowermost sandstone unit on the southern limb of the Hardey Syncline and a wider spread of fluvial current directions from northeast to southwest.","The Koolbye Formation was interpreted as a coastal to shallow marine deposit by Thorne and Tyler (1996), and later reinterpreted as predominantly fluvial in the lower part by Martin et al. (2000). In a more detailed study, involving analysis of both the northern and southern limbs of the Hardey Syncline, Mazumder et al. (2015) identified a transition from marginal marine to fluvial-aeolian deposition through the Koolbye Formation. On the southern limb of the syncline, shallow marine intertidal deposits (lower two sandstone units) are interpreted to pass upward into beach, coastal aeolian, and ultimately braided fluvial deposits (upper sandstone unit). On the northern limb, the basal intertidal deposits are absent, and the formation is dominated by beach, aeolian and fluvial deposits.",,,,"The Koolbye Formation conformably overlies the Kungarra Formation, and is in turn conformably overlain by the Kazput Formation.

The upper 1.5 m of the member consists of very fine-grained siliceous volcaniclastic sandstone and the topmost contact is marked by a 0.5-1 m thick unit of dolomitic sandstone breccia that contains angular felsic volcanic clasts.  Petrographically, the felsic volcaniclastic rock is composed of recrystallized, felsic, vitric volcaniclastic sandstone and siltstone. Clasts consist of diffuse, recrystallized and sericitized vitric lapilli, commonly defined by fine-grained granular iron oxide inclusions, angular and broken sericitized feldspar, millimetre-sized anhedral irregular aggregates of chlorite, muscovite, and both angular and rounded fragments of &beta;-quartz.

5227,23705,D-_ko-ss,1,Kopke Sandstone,1,"Red and brown medium- and fine-grained sandstone, very coarse-grained and pebbly in part, lesser siltstone; redbed succession (subsurface only)","The Kopke Sandstone (Hocking et al., 1987; Gorter et al. 1994; Iasky and Mory, 1999) consists of red and brown, in places grey, dominantly medium- to fine-grained sandstone with lesser siltstone, deposited in distal fluvial to coastal conditions. It is a redbed succession, and cores through the sandstone are very similar to the both fluvial (FA1, FA3) and tidal sandflat facies (FA2) of the Tumblagooda Sandstone in the Murchison Gorge. The sandstone contains a conodont fauna indicative of a Late Lochovian (Early Devonian) age (Mory et al. 1998). Based on its age and lithology, it is the most probable correlative of all or part of the Tumblagooda Sandstone as exposed in the Kalbarri region. It is notably thinner, about 500 m compared to more than 1200 m of Tumblagooda Sandstone exposed east and west of the Northampton Inlier.  The type section is in Yaringa 1, between 326 and 855 m. The only other complete intersections are in Hamelin Pool 1 and 2, both 466 m thick.","The Kopke Sandstone has been recognized in deep exploration and stratigraphic drillholes in the subsurface in the Shark Bay region. The most southerly intersection is in Coburn 1. The formation correlates with the Tumblagooda Sandstone as exposed in the Murchison Gorge.  The only known complete sections are in Yaringa 1 (529 m, 326-855 m), and Hamelin Pool 1 (466 m, 346-852 m) and 2 (466 m, 325-791 m). Other sections have an eroded top (Coburn 1, 186-505.5 m; Tamala 1, 398-425 m) or did not reach the base of the Kopke Sandstone (Yaringa East 1, 395.5-829 m TD). There are several partial intersections in deep water bores north and east of Shark Bay (Iasky and Mory, 1999, Appendix 4). Mory et al. (2003) re-interpreted the section intersected by Mooka 1 (Mory and Yasin, 1998), and considered the section between 260.5 and 281 m to be probably Kopke Sandstone, resting on Coburn Formation with no intermediate Faure Formation.     Gorter et al. (1994) excised the 820 - 855 m interval in Yaringa 1 from the Kopke Sandstone and placed it in the Faure Formation, but Iasky and Mory (1999) noted that interval is dominantly sandstone, and showed it as Kopke Sandstone on figures and in text. 855 m is accepted here as the base of the Kopke Sandstone. ","The Kopke Sandstone was named (after Kopke Point on Yaringa 1:245 000 sheet) and defined by Hocking (1985), and fully described by Hocking et al. (1987). Hocking (1985) proposed a type section in Yaringa 1 between 326 and 855 m. Gorter et al. (1994) revised this to 326 to 820 m, assigning the lower 35 m to a new unit, the Faure Formation (note Gorter et al. wrote they assigned the lower 33 m to the Faure Formation, but specified the depth as 820 m). Mory et al. (1998) and Iasky and Mory (1999) showed the base at 855 m in figures and in text, as that interval is dominantly sandstone. The Kopke Sandstone was initially referred to in Yaringa 1 Well Completion Report and later well completion reports as &quot;Unknown formation B&quot; (Henderson and Shannon, 1966).    The sandstone has only been recognized in deep exploration and stratigraphic bores in the Shark Bay region, as far south as Coburn 1, and several deep water bores north and east of Shark Bay.",,"The Kopke Sandstone consists predominantly of quartz sandstone with minor mudstone and siltstone. Yasin and Mory (1999a) noted dolomite was present as thin wackstone to mudstone beds and cement in sandstone below 472 m in Coburn 1, and Yasin and Mory (1999b) described very coarse-grained sandstone that formed the lower parts of thick fining-upwards couplets in Yaringa East 1.  The paragraph following is from Hocking et al. (1987). The Kopke Sandstone is composed predominantly of red or brown sandstone, which changes cyclically in size from very fine at the base to coarse in the middle, returning to fine at the top. The grains are subangular to angular and are moderately sorted; mica is a common accessory. Minor siltstone and shale are present, and are also predominantly brown. The red and white blotching which characterizes the Tumblagooda Sandstone is common, and in Core 5 from Yaringa I (355-358 m depth) clearly outlines bioturbation. Poorly sorted, coarse-grained, cross-stratified sandstones, indistinguishable from Facies Association 3 (upper fluvial facies) sandstones in outcrop of the Tumblagooda Sandstone are present in Core 6 (450-456 m) and Core 9 (739-742 m).  The Kopke Sandstone extends from 186 to 505.5 m in Coburn 1. Yasin and Mory (1999) noted three prominent internal erosion surfaces (at 258 m, 373 m, and 428.5 m) which they interpreted as sequence boundaries. There is a prominent spike on the gamma log at 247 m. The entire section is dominated by grey to red and orange cross-bedded sandstone, with wavy bedding, ripple lamination and parallel lamination in varying abundance. Bioturbation is locally present. The section below 428.5 m conatins thin mudstone and dolomite interbeds below 472 m. Near 500 m, the sandstone is notably feldspathic with a clay matrix, and carbonate-cemented below 500.5 m, just above the Faure Formation. Thin mudstone beds are also common between 258 and 291 m. Yasin and Mory noted paleocurrent directions were generally variable.  In Yaringa East 1, Yasin and Mory (1999b) described large-scale fining-upwards cycles, grading upwards from very coarse-grained and pebbly thickly cross-bedded sandstone to fine-grained more thinly bedded sandstone and mudstone, with some vertical burrows and possible vertical rootlets. These appear very similar to the facies association couplets in the outcropping Tumblagooda Sandstone (Hocking, 1991).    ","Based on continuous core through the Kopke Sandstone in Coburn 1, Yasin and Mory (1999) considered it was deposited in very shallow marine, sabkha, fluvial, lacustrine, and eolian environments. Deposition was initially in sabhka and very shallow marine conditions, with a very small depositional slope. Hinterland uplift led to the progradation of coarser grained sandstones, with deposition in fluvial and near shore, perhaps even lacustrine, settings. The presence of bioturbation in Coburn 1 and Yaringa 1 and lack of woody material is more suggestive of marine to coastal conditions rather than a fully continental lacustrine setting, given the earliest Devonian age of the Kopke Sandstone.  The presence of coarse-grained sandstone suggests fluvial deposition of part of the sandstone.",,529,,"The boundary between the Kopke Sandstone and the overlying Sweeney Mia Formation is generally considered conformable (see Gorter et al., 1994 and Mory et al., 1998). The contact in Yaringa East 1 is sharp with a basal very coarse-grained sandstone and pebble lag (Yasin and Mory, 1999b), but this is assumed to be local and of limited lateral extent, much like the base of the Gabba Gabba Member of the Tumblagooda Sandstone (see Hocking, 1991).",,17,,,,4,,,,419.2,,407.6,,"The Kopke Sandstone contains a sparse conodont fauna indicative of a Late Lochovian (Early Devonian) age (Mory et al. 1998).

Limestone is characteristic, but siltstone like that in the Wongawol Formation may be the more common lithotype. Estimates of stratigraphic thickness range from about 300 to 500 m, but are complicated by small scale folding and faulting, and poor exposure. Near Thurraguddy Bore in the lower Kulele Limestone, spectacular large individual stromatolite domes are up to 3.5 m high, 4 m wide, and 5 m long. Domes are composed of and grow out of smaller colonial columnar stromatolites, and voids between domes are filled by peloidal limestone, smaller digitate stromatolites and microbial intraclast breccies. Compared to the Wongawol Formation, the Kulele Limestone records a slight deepening of the basin and decrease in terrigenous influx. Metre-scale shallowing-upward cycles are present through most of the unit, and record regular minor fluctuations in sea-level in a shallow subtidal setting.  The formation is clearly transitional out of the Wongawol Formation, and is overlain relatively sharply but conformably by the Mulgarra Sandstone.","The Kulele Limestone is preserved in the central-eastern part of the basin, and in a small outlier to the west near Thurraguddy Bore. Hall and Goode (1978) and Bunting (1986) estimated the type section in the Timperley Range southeast of Mt Throssell is about 300 m thick, but had not measured the section. A partial section further southeast near Buljah Pool suggests a somewhat greater thickness. This section spans only the upper Kulele Limestone, and is 301 m thick.","The Kulele Limestone was named by Hall et al. (1977) as  Kulele Creek Limestone  and described in detail first by Hall and Goode (1978) and later by Bunting (1986), who modified the name to Kulele Limestone. The type section is 13 km southeast of Mt Throssell at the front of the Timperley Range (464980E 7122420N to 469975E 7125200N), and was not measured by Bunting (1986). A 73 m partial section was measured in 2001 from the start of exposure southwest of Mt Hoskin (451915E 7130100N approximately) up to the trig point (452760E 7130755N), about 15.7 km northwest of the type section. This section is a characteristic reference section, but intersects neither the top nor the base of the formation. It is shown on previous maps as  P_Ek  or (on LEE STEERE)  P_Ek-kl.   The lower boundary with the Wongawol Formation was taken by Bunting (1986) at the base of a metre-thick continuous bed of stromatolitic limestone or cross-bedded calcarenite, and the top at the first appearance of laterally extensive quartz arenite. Bunting considered that the upper boundary, with the Mulgarra Sandstone, might be disconformable, but it is here interpreted simply in terms of renewed terrigenous influx, in a continued nearshore setting. The appearance of cross-bedded, ferrunginized, glauconitic sandstone reflects shallowing and consequent rapid progradation.",,"The Kulele Limestone is a cyclic shallow-water platform succession of interbedded stromatolitic limestone, intraclastic carbonate breccia, oolitic and pisolitic limestone, calcarenite, siltstone, and sandstone. Stromatolitic limestone is the characteristic lithology, but siltstone little different to that in the Wongawol Formation is of similar abundance but is commonly recessive.  Stromatolitic limestone, with lesser dolomite, forms cyclic sequences separated by clastic units. Cycles are typically about 10 m thick, but locally only a metre thick, and cyclic intervals are separated in places by clastic layers up to 50 m thick. 'Cycles' only a metre or two thick may reflect local paleotopography, bedforms and biostromes rather than true allochthonous cyclicity. The limestone units are mostly thickly bedded, and internally laminated, with the laminae on scales of 1 to 5 mm. Stromatolites range from small domes a few cm across to large domes, 2 m high and 3 m across, which coalesce to bioherms up to 30 m long (Bunting, 1986). These stromatolite domes are commonly asymmetric and elongated, presumably at right angles to the direction of wave translation - the elongation is interpreted to be approximately perpendicular to the shoreline. This can be seen in the Thurraguddy Bore outlier on LEE STEERE and terraces on Mt Hoskin on CARNEGIE. Bunting (1986) studied the Thurraguddy Bore outlier in detail. There, the basal 25 m of Kulele Limestone is exposed and can be divided into seven cyclic pairs of limestone and shale, ranging from 2.5 to 7.5 m thick. Each cycle represents a transgressive (limestone)-regressive (shale) couplet. Stromatolites in the Thurraguddy Bore outlier form two bands. Band 1 has low domes, up to 100 mm high, circular to elongate with length:breadth ratios of about 3:1. Band 2 contains domes up to 2 m high with individual domes reaching 3 m across, forming bioherms 30 m long and 10 m wide. The direction of stromatolite elongation is variable, but commonly roughly east-west to northwest-southeast. Stromatolite forms in the Kulele Limestone include  Haraheedia kuleliensis  Grey 1984. The large bulbous stromatolites remain unnamed.  Oolitic and pisolitic limestone shows two types of allochems (Bunting, 1986). In one, large pisoliths are elongate with an intraclastic core, surrounded by concentric laminae up to several mm thick. The second type is smaller with both radial and concentric laminae. These features may indicate a two-stage origin, whereby ooliths initially formed in quiet water, then were transported into a more agitated environment. Locally there are breccia layers, characterised by tabular intraclasts up to 200 mm long, forming beds at the base of the limestone cycles. Calcarenites are fine-to medium-grained rocks composed of granular calcite with minor detrital quartz. Locally, some glauconite is present. Shales are typically purple, maroon or grey-greenish in colour and contain white mica and chlorite. Sandstone interbedded with the shaly rocks, contains feldspar, quartz with a calcareous cement and with muscovite and chlorite imparting a degree of fissility. In the upper part of the formation, sandstone is coarser grained and contains glauconite at the expense of the feldspar, which becomes a minor component (Bunting, 1986).  Cross-bedded calcarenites and ollitic limestones indicate shallow, current swept conditions. Microbial intraclast breccias, characterized by peloids, ooliths, and thin elongate lathes of microbially bound limestone in a muddy matrix, accumulated locally between stromatolite columns and domes.","The stromatolitic limestones and cyclic nature of the Kulele Limestone indicate deposition in shallow-marine nearshore to coastal conditions, with regular short-term sea-level change on a scale of a few metres to perhaps 20 m (based on the thickness of the cycles), possibly driven by orbital forcing. Metre-scale cyclicity has long been viewed as a fundamental component of Phanerozoic platform carbonates (Goldhammer et al., 1987, 1990, 1993; Anderson &amp; Goodwin, 1990, Elrick and Read, 1991 ), and is commonly, but not always attributed to orbital forcing (Milankovich cyclicity - Fischer and Bottjer, 1991, Franseen et al., 1991, De Boer and Smith, 1994, Read et al., 1995, House and Gale, 199 5; Playford et al., 2009). Orbital forcing is less commonly invoked for Paleoproterozoic successions.",300,600,,"The Kulele Limestone is gradational out of the Wongawol Formation. The upper contact with the Mulgarra Sandstone was considered by Bunting (1986) to be possibly disconformable, but this was not verified in the present study.

1284,73260,P_-WKku-od,797,Kulkatharra Dolerite,1,Dolerite and gabbro sills intruded into Edmund Group and Collier Group,"The Kulkatharra Dolerite forms the western part of the Warakurna Large Igneous Province (WLIP) which extends from Western Australia into the Northern Territory and South Australia, covering an area of approximately 1.5 million km&sup2;. The unit comprises voluminous, laterally continuous (up to 210 km in length), predominantly northwesterly-trending sills, which were emplaced into mixed siliciclasticcarbonate sedimentary rocks of the Edmund and Collier Groups  over a c. 17 Ma period between c. 1067 and 1084 Ma. The sills have an average thickness of 100250 m, but locally can be up to 600 m thick. The sills commonly exhibit chilled margins, but locally some of the host sedimentary rocks have peperitic and associated fluidization textures, or may exhibit disharmonic folding and brecciation, suggesting that the mafic sills were intruded into partly lithified sediments.  The Kulkatharra Dolerite consists of slightly weathered to moderately altered massive, fine- to very coarse-grained, equigranular to subophitic quartz dolerite with irregular granophyric segregations, and locally pegmatitic to leucogabbroic patches. Plagioclase and pyroxene form the primary mineral assemblage which has undergone low to medium metamorphic-grade alteration with the growth of mineral phases such as chlorite, sericite, saussurite, carbonate, prehnite, bowlingite, leucoxene, maghemite and minor biotite, epidote, smectite, actinolite and pyrite.    The Kulkatharra Dolerite is notably enriched in most rare earth elements (REE, particularly heavy REE) and high field strength elements (HFSE), and is characterized by smooth negatively sloping chondrite-normalized REE profiles with low to moderate degrees of fractionation, and weak negative Eu anomalies. The mafic rocks have high  143 Nd/ 144 Nd values ranging from 0.512134 to 0.512413 with a wide range of &epsilon;Nd (T)  values between 0.4 and -2.22, leading to a wide range of depleted mantle model ages (T2DM) between 1.47 and 1.84 Ga. <span style=""font-size: 20px   ","The Kulkatharra Dolerite forms the western part of the c.1085 to 1040 Ma WLIP (Wingate et al., 2004). The WLIP contains both intrusive and extrusive rocks, which are exposed throughout Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, covering an area of approximately 1.5 million km&sup2; (Morris and Pirajno, 2005). The intrusive rocks are dominantly mafic in composition, and consist of abundant and widespread dolerite sills and dyke swarms, but also include layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions, and locally voluminous sills, plugs, and plutons of granitic rock (Howard et al., 2011).  Within the Capricorn Orogen, the Kulkatharra Dolerite comprises voluminous, predominantly northwesterly trending, laterally continuous (up to 210 km in length) dolerite sills. The sills were emplaced into mixed siliciclasticcarbonate rocks of the Collier Group (Depositional packages 5 and 6), and to a lesser extent, into the underlying Edmund Group (Depositional packages 1 to 4). The sills have an average thickness of 100250 m. However, in the western part of the orogen they attain a maximum thickness of 400-450 m, whereas in the eastern part they may be up to 600 m thick. Although the sills generally trend in a northwesterly direction, their orientation is principally controlled by the orientation of regional-scale fold axes, and so in the central and eastern parts of the orogen (e.g. on CARDAWAN, THREE RIVERS, LOFTY RANGE and ILGARARI) the sills trend east-west to northeasterly. While most sills are locally conformable with the host sedimentary rocks, they are regionally discordant along strike and characterized by a step-and-stair geometry (Martin et al., 2005; e.g. HNCMTV002143, Zone 50, MGA 560912E 7341783N).  In the western and northern part of the Capricorn Orogen, the dolerite sills are distributed within a structural corridor defined by the major crust-cutting Talga and Godfrey Faults. The sills form particularly extensive outcrops within the core and along the northern limb of the Wanna Syncline, as well as on the Pingandy Shelf of ELLIOTT CREEK and KENNETH RANGE. Minor intrusions are present in the northeastern part of PEEDAWARRA, the northeastern corner of EDMUND, the southeastern corner of ULLAWARRA, and the southwestern part of CAPRICORN.  Farther east in the central and eastern parts of the Capricorn Orogen, dolerite intrusions are abundant in the eastern part of TEANO, the northwestern corner of ILGARARI, and on MOUNT VERNON, TANGADEE and LOFTY RANGE, particular to the north of the Mount Vernon Fault. Kulkatharra Dolerite sills are also present within the Backdoor Hills and Collier Range Synclines, and around the eastern closure of the Cherry Syncline on CARDAWAN; within the Dunlop Anticline, the central part of the Mindi Syncline and the Beasly Syncline on THREE RIVERS; and within the western parts of the Mindi and the Beasley Synclines, within the Coodwa Group Synclines, the Lion North Syncline and just south of the western part of the Jamindi Anticline on JAMINDI. Minor exposures occur within the Jamindi Syncline on the northeastern part of MILGUN and within the core of the Calyie Syncline on CALYIE.","The Kulkatharra Dolerite is named after Kulkatharra Spring (Zone 50, MGA 475100E 739900N), situated approximately 25 km northeast of Wanna Homestead on ELLIOTT CREEK. The name was first published by Thorne and Martin (2007) on the PEEDAWARRA map sheet.",,"The Kulkatharra Dolerite is exposed as rounded boulders and blocky outcrops on low ridges, flat hills, in stream beds, saddles or on hill slopes, and is commonly extremely ferruginous on weathered surfaces.  The Kulkatharra Dolerite comprises moderately fresh, fine- to very coarse-grained, massive, equigranular to locally porphyritic quartz dolerite with irregular patches of very coarse-grained quartz dolerite, quartz gabbro to leucogabbro, and irregular pegmatitic to granophyric segregations (e.g. WAROX site PCM269, Zone 50, MGA 521720E 7327651N).The upper and lower margins of the dolerite sills are commonly fine- to very fine-grained, with the dolerite gradually increasing in grain size to medium and coarse grained in central parts (e.g. ATBCOL003915, Zone 50, MGA 709688E 7260558N).The central and upper parts of the sills have common pegmatitic to granophyric segregations.  The mafic rocks have equigranular-intergranular textures with subophitic and lesser ophitic areas, and patchy glomeroporphyritic clusters of plagioclase-pyroxene-opaque minerals. They have a primary mineral assemblage of plagioclase (40-60%) and clinopyroxene (30-50%), although locally plagioclase may form up to 8090% of the rock. Plagioclase and pyroxene (typically augite) are intergrown with interstitial, granular, late magmatic quartz (~5%), quartzalkali feldspar granophyre (520%), clouded K-feldspar and very fine crystalline matrix (typically ~5% up to 35%), hornblende (<5%), rare biotite flakes (1-3%), and irregular opaque minerals (520%). Accessory phases may include apatite, zircon, baddeleyite, traces of clinozoisite and epidote, minor titanite and very fine-grained radioactive minerals typically associated with biotite or chlorite. Locally, disseminated irregular sulfide blebs or skeletal inclusions are up to 6 mm in size (e.g. AMTBAN003074, Zone 50, MGA 692097E 7189823N or OXBBAN000038, MGA 624246E 7322148N).  Plagioclase (An 3562 ) forms anhedral to subeuhedral, 0.51.0 mm long (up to 7 mm), stubby to elongate prisms, or, less commonly, xenomorphic crystals; all are commonly albite-twinned or zoned. It is typically moderately to intensely altered to sericite and saussurite, or rarely overgrown by dusty epidote, clinozoisite, prehnite and carbonate (typically calcite). On PEEDAWARRA, carbonate alteration is extensive, and blade-shaped chlorite and granophyric quartz grains locally form 5060% of the assemblage (e.g. OXBBAN000195, Zone 50, MGA 521699E 7327666N).  Clinopyroxene (mainly augite) forms xenomorphic grains or subeuhedral stubby to elongate prisms, with local rare, euhedral, prismatic crystals up to 5 mm long, which are commonly simply twinned (100). Some crystals exhibit hour-glass zoning, reaction rims and may contain exsolution lamellae of orthopyroxene or pigeonite, or show rare vermicular textures. Clinopyroxene is generally very fresh, although locally it is replaced by dusty amphibole-leucoxene aggregates or Fe-chlorite, or less commonly by syntaxial pseudomorphs of brownish amphibole. Less commonly, pyroxene and rare epidote grains enclose fine-grained sulfides. Augite may be rimmed by green-brown hornblende and chlorite, which in turn is partly intergrown with plagioclase or granophyre. Locally, areas of hornblende are adjacent to pyroxene, with deep blue-green ?hastingsite rimming brown ?titanpargasite. Some dolerite sills contain rounded, prismatic to isometric oikocrysts of extensively altered ?pigeonite or ?olivine, up to 2.5 mm in size, which are completely replaced by rusty-brown bowlingite along cracks and cleavage planes. Less commonly, augite is mantled by pale-green chlorite and biotite.  Locally, extensive areas of mesostasis are interstitial to the plagioclase, pyroxene and opaque minerals. Patches of mesostasis up to 5 mm across are randomly scattered with microspherulitic to microgranophyric, granular and granophyric textures. Granophyre is commonly nucleated on euhedral plagioclase laths or clouded K-feldspar. Rare, granular, late-magmatic quartz is present within granophyric patches, and in places biotitechlorite intergrowths are closely associated with the magmatic quartz.  Apatite is a common accessory mineral in and adjacent to the granophyre and late magmatic quartz. It forms acicular and/or elongate crystals that are locally as long as 2 mm, but less than 50 &mu;m wide, and are commonly hollow. Traces of apatite are also found in plagioclase grains. Opaque minerals, mainly magnetiteilmenite and minor pyrite, form interstitial grains or aggregates between plagioclase and pyroxene. Individual crystals are up to 6 mm in size and are typically anhedral. Less common dendriticskeletal grains consist of ilmenite lamellae mantled by magnetite and variably altered to leucoxene or maghemite.  The Kulkatharra Dolerite has a distinctive geochemical composition, notably different than that of other mafic magmatic rocks within the western Capricorn Orogen. Mafic rocks of the Kulkatharra Dolerite have a wide range of compositions: SiO 2  (49.3152.76%, average = 50.91%), K 2 O (0.881.57%, average = 1.10%) and high but narrow range of concentrations of Na 2 O (2.102.83%, average = 2.44%), moderate concentrations of CaO (7.1510.04%, average = 8.95%), relatively low MgO (4.097.72%, average = 5.10%), P 2 O 5  (0.180.28%, average = 0.22%), and highly variable and typically low Mg# values (27.5463.12, average = 40.73). The Kulkatharra Dolerite is also distinguished by much higher and variable concentrations of Cu (118234 ppm, average = 166 ppm), and relatively low Cr (8147 ppm, average = 58 ppm).  The mafic rocks are notably enriched in most REE (particular heavy REE) and HFSE that, on average, have narrow ranges: La (16.37-27.30 ppm, average = 21.43 ppm), Ce (31.6861.20 ppm, average = 45.50 ppm), Nd (19.3731.22 ppm, average = 25.67 ppm), Sm (4.787.74 ppm, average = 6.12 ppm), Gd (4.91-8.14 ppm, average = 6.16 ppm), Yb (2.153.57 ppm, average = 2.93 ppm), Y (25.9045.30 ppm, average = 33.56 ppm), Zr (123-243 ppm, average = 172 ppm), Nb (7.0014.30 ppm, average = 10.67 ppm), Hf (3.126.10 ppm, average = 4.67 ppm), Th (3.00-6.13 ppm, average = 4.80 ppm), and have smooth negatively sloping chondrite-normalized REE profiles with low to moderate degrees of fractionation in both light REE: (La/Sm) N  = (1.852.62) and heavy REE: (Gd/Yb) N  = 1.622.23), and weak negative Eu anomalies, whereas Sm does not show any significant anomalies. The rocks have relatively high trace-element ratios: Th/La (0.17-0.27, average = 0.22), La/Nb (1.482.41, average = 1.97), Th/Nb (0.25-0.61, average = 0.46), and moderate La/Sm (2.874.06, average = 3.47).  The Kulkatharra Dolerite has high  143 Nd/ 144 Nd values ranging from 0.512134 to 0.512413 with a wide range of &epsilon;N (T)  values between 0.4 and -2.22, leading to a wide range of depleted mantle model ages (T2DM) between 1.47 and 1.84 Ga.",,,,,"The dolerite sills were emplaced into sedimentary rocks dominated by fine-grained siliciclastic and dolostone successions within both the Edmund Group (Depositional packages 1 to 4) and the Collier Group (Depositional packages 5 and6). However, intrusions within the Edmund Group are only evident in the northeastern part of the Capricorn Orogen. Elsewhere, the Kulkatharra Dolerite intrudes across large areas of the Collier Group (Depositional packages 5-6) which is dominated by siltstone of the Ilgarari Formation on CALYIE and THREE RIVERS, and siltstone to fine-grained sandstone of the Backdoor Formation on CARDAWAN. On LOFTY RANGE and ILGARARI the dolerite sills intrude dolostone, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone of the Backdoor and Calyie Formations.  Most of the contacts with the host sedimentary rocks are sharp, with the dolerites locally showing  chilled  margins. The host sedimentary rocks (depending on sill thickness and host-rock composition) commonly show up to several metres of silicification and recrystallization to hornfels (Martin et al., 2005). Commonly, the sedimentary rocks immediately above the dolerite sills display distinctive saprolitic and ferruginous (Fe-oxides) alteration, or close to the contact are locally silicified and ferruginous, forming dark-grey or black fine-grained rocks (e.g. OXBCOL000377, Zone 50, MGA 719903E 7257406N or OXBCOL000397, MGA 726805E 7258422N). Locally, the upper margins of the sills are fine-grained  chilled  margins with a recrystallized interstitial matrix, which gradually increases in grain size towards the central part of sills to become low to moderately fresh medium- to coarse-grained equigranular doleritemicrogabbro. In rare cases, the dolerite margins show macro-scale textures which imply that some of the dolerite sills were emplaced at relatively shallow depths, possibly into variably lithified sediments (Martin, 2003; Morris and Pirajno, 2005). The key features include plastically deformed fragments of the surrounding sedimentary rocks with inclusions of those rocks within the dolerite; fine-grained amygdaloidal tops to the dolerite sills; locally disharmonically folded and brecciated sedimentary rocks (e.g. OXBBAN000111, Zone 50, MGA 626298E 7330270N), and rare peperitic textures (e.g. WAROX sites DMM1300, Zone 50, MGA 510426E 7367449N and DMM1298, Zone 50, MGA 510745E 7367309N) with associated fluidization. Quartz veins, quartz vein breccia and rare calcite veins are also associated with the contact zones (Martin, 2003; Martin et al., 2005; e.g. DMM1311, Zone 50, MGA 527206E 7368070N).",,17,,,,4,,,,1084,6,1067,14,"Six Kulkatharra Dolerite sills have been dated directly by SHRIMP, using magmatic zircons and baddeleyite grains extracted from fine- to coarse-grained granophyric quartz dolerite, and pegmatitic leucogabbro with coarse-grained granophyric segregations.  On ELLIOTT CREEK, zircon and baddeleyite from mesostasis-enriched quartz dolerite, about 1 km north of Strama Gap, gave weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* dates of 1072 Â± 12 Ma and 1071 Â± 57 Ma, respectively (GSWA 169011; Nelson, 2001a). A combination of both zircon and baddeleyite  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* dates yielded an age of 1071 Â± 8 Ma (Wingate, 2002) which is taken to be the best estimate for the crystallization age of the dolerite sill.

The weighted mean for all accepted  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb baddeleyite and zircon data gave an age of 1067Â± 14 Ma (Sample WANC, Wingate, 2002). On KENNETH RANGE, about 25 km south of No. 36 Well, zircon was extracted from a very coarse-grained granophyric segregation within a coarse-grained dolerite, and gave a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1076 Â± 4 Ma (GSWA 156602, Wingate and Bodorkos, 2007). On ULLAWARRA, 26 analyses of 19 baddeleyites from medium-grained granophyric quartz dolerite, gave a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1074 Â± 17 Ma (GSWA 156750, Nelson, 2001b). However, the weighted mean for all accepted  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* data within two analytical sessions yielded mean ages of 1056 Â± 25.4 Ma (n=7) for session 1 and 1071.1 Â± 11.7 Ma (n=19) for session 2, whereas the combined data gave a weighted mean age of 1068 Â± 22 Ma, which is taken to be the best estimate for the crystallization age of the dolerite sill (Wingate, 2002).

These ages are considered to date the timing of emplacement and igneous crystallization of the Kulkatharra Dolerite sills.

Within its type area, the upper part of the Kungarra Formation also contains two distinctive glacigenic diamictite units, the Meteorite Bore (P_-TKkm-se) and Calgra Members (P_-TKkg-sd), and is conformably overlain by the Koolbye Formation. The age of the Kungarra Formation is uncertain, but it was deposited sometime between c. 2445 and 2208 Ma. The Meteorite Bore Member has a maximum depositional age of c. 2420 Ma, and the upper Kungarra Formation was intruded by sills of the Balgara Dolerite at c. 2208 Ma.","The Kungarra Formation is only defined in the Hardey Syncline on HARDEY and ROCKLEA, but is probably equivalent to large parts of the undivided Turee Creek Group outside of this area (Trendall, 1979). The Kungarra Formation has a maximum thickness of about 2.8 km in the Hardey Syncline where the lower part is best exposed at the western end of the syncline north of Horseshoe Creek (around Zone 50, MGA 478500E 7477100N), and the upper part south of the creek (around Zone 50, MGA 486800E 7473500N).","The Kungarra Formation was named by Trendall (1979) as part of his revision of the Mount Bruce Supergroup, and was established to encompass a monotonous sequence of predominantly fine-grained clastic sedimentary rocks exposed between the top of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation and his &ldquo;unnamed quartzite unit 1&rdquo; in the Hardey Syncline on HARDEY and ROCKLEA. Due to the poor outcrop, no type section was defined, but the type area is between the Beasley River and Kungarra Gorge on the northern limb of the Hardey Syncline where it is very poorly exposed. The name is derived from Kungarra Gorge (Zone 50, MGA 493282E 7477230N), and the formation contains two formally named members, the Meteorite Bore Member (P_-TKkm-s) and Calgra Member (P_-TKkg-sd).",,"Glacigenic diamictite and siltstone of the Meteorite Bore Member is a useful stratigraphic marker within the Kungarra Formation that can be used to divide the formation into upper and lower parts in the type area. The dominant lithology of the lower part is thin-bedded, locally turbiditic, mudstone, siltstone, and sandstone that form an overall upward coarsening and shallowing succession. The contact with the underlying Boolgeeda Iron Formation in the type area is characterised by an abrupt change in lithology from strongly magnetic banded iron formation to intercalated green-weathering siltstone and mudstone with thin laminated chert beds. Within the lower Kungarra Formation, mudstone and fine-grained siltstone are parallel-planar laminated whereas coarse-grained siltstone and fine-grained sandstone are either parallel-planar laminated or ripple cross-laminated. Siltstones and sandstones are also locally dolomitic. Coarser grained sandstones form tabular to lenticular beds which are either structureless or normally graded, with locally preserved flute casts at the base, and are more abundant in the upper parts of the lower Kungarra Formation. Immediately below the Meteorite Bore Member, the formation is characterised by fine-grained planar- and ripple laminated sandstone, coarse-grained cross-stratified sandstone, and stromatolitic and cross-stratified dolomite.   In the Hardey Syncline, the Meteorite Bore Member is the lowermost of two recognised glaciogenic intervals within the Kungarra Formation. Both consist of interbedded glacial diamictite, fine- to coarse-grained sandstone, argillite, and local carbonate rocks. The second interval of glaciogenic diamictite (Calgra Member, P_-TKkg-sd) is approximately 500 m above the Meteorite Bore Member in the vicinity of the type section on the northern limb of the Hardey Syncline (Van Kranendonk and Mazumder, 2015; Van Kranendonk et al., 2015) and is underlain by about 450 m of interbedded mudstone, siltstone and fine to coarse-grained sandstone. Above these glacigenic intervals (in the vicinity of Zone 50, MGA 491140E 7472170N), the Kungarra Formation consists of poorly exposed siltstone and fine- to medium-grained sandstone below the conformable contact with the overlying Koolbye Formation.","The lower Kungarra Formation, below the Meteorite Bore Member, was deposited in a deep marine environment, below storm wave-base. The lowermost part of this interval is starved of coarse clastic detritus and also records the end of BIF deposition in the Mount Bruce Supergroup, which has been interpreted to be a product of the rise in atmospheric oxygen during the Great Oxidation Event (Van Kranendonk et al., 2015). The remainder of the formation records a gradual shallowing from deep-marine turbidites to shallow and marginal marine environments (Seymour et al., 1988; Martin et al., 2000; Van Kranendonk et al., 2015). Interpretations for the overall depositional setting include a deep-marine shelf (Thorne and Tyler, 1996), prodelta to offshore turbidites (Martin et al., 2000), and a deep marine to inter- and supra-tidal delta system (Van Kranendonk et al., 2015). Paleocurrent directions from sole marks on turbidite beds were predominantly towards the northwest and southeast (Martin et al., 2000) whereas cross-bedding and ripple lamination record transport predominantly to the southwest in deeper water facies and to the northeast-southwest in shallower water (Martin et al., 2000; Van Kranendonk et al., 2015). These data suggest a basin with a roughly E-W trending shoreline that deepened in a northerly direction. The tectonic setting is generally interpreted to be a retroarc foreland basin with an uplifted hinterland to the south (Krapez, 1996; Martin et al., 2000), whereas Van Kranendonk et al., (2015) have interpreted an intracontinental setting with uplift to the southeast.",,,,"The Kungarra Formation paraconformably overlies the Boolgeeda Iron Formation at the top of the Hamersley Group, and is conformably overlain by the Koolbye Formation in the Hardey Syncline. Evidence for the paraconformable nature of the basal contact is provided by the local preservation of the Cave Hill Member (P_-HAov-se) in the Hardey Syncline (e.g. DMMHAM000034 and DMMHAM000116). Elsewhere in this area, and around the eastern closure of the Wyloo Anticline, the Kungarra Formation mainly overlies the second BIF unit of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation, although it locally overlies the basal BIF unit (e.g. DMMHAM000104 and DMMHAM000105).",,17,,,,4,,,,2445,,2208,,"The age of the Kungarra Formation is very poorly known.

920,74752,P_-KR-xs-b,791,Kunmarnara Group,1,Undivided siliciclastic and mafic volcanic rocks; minor felsic volcanic rocks,"The Kunmarnara Group (P_-KR-xs-b) &mdash; comprising the MacDougall Formation and the Mummawarrawarra Basalt &mdash; was deposited unconformably over Mesoproterozoic rocks of the Musgrave Province along the (presently) westerly to west-northwesterly trending margins of a rift basin traced by the northern sides of the Blackstone and Finlay Ranges.  The MacDougall Formation lies at the base of the Kunmarnara Group and comprises poorly sorted, arkosic sandstones and quartz-pebble conglomerates. The rocks of this unit are typically deformed and metamorphosed to form a muscovite-bearing quartzite found along the northern edge of the rift. The detrital zircon age spectra of the McDougall Formation is dominated by a c. 1179 Ma source, which forms the maximum depositional age for the Kunmarnara Group (Quentin de Gromard et al., 2016). However, a more reasonable maximum age for the formation of the group is c. 1085 Ma, which is the regional maximum age of magmatism related to the Giles Event (Edgoose et al., 2004; Evins et al., 2010; Howard et al., 2011).  The Mummawarrawarra Basalt conformably overlies the MacDougall Formation and comprises a sequence of metre-scale thick, typically basaltic andesite flow units. The layers range from massive plagioclase-phyric to highly amygdaloidal. This basalt is metamorphosed to amphibolite facies in proximity to mafic intrusions of the Giles Suite, often appearing as inclusions within these intrusions. While the MacDougall Formation and Mummawarrawarra Basalt are cut by the oldest mafic intrusions of the Giles Suite (P_-WKG), the overlying layers of the Tollu Group are clearly younger than P_-WKG units. As a result, the former two formations have been split from the Tollu Group, together forming the Kunmarnara Group (Smithies et al., 2009).","Outcrop of the Kunmarnara Group is concentrated along the northwest-trending, southwestern boundary of the Tjuni Purlka Zone. The northern portion of this unit forms a 3-5 km wide by 100 km long, west- to northwest-striking, gently to moderately south-southwest dipping belt that runs along the northern side of the Finlay (FINLAYSON) and Blackstone (BLACKSTONE and HOLT) ranges. Its continuation to the south on BELL ROCK is in the form of a 10 km &times; 50 km, northwest-trending, shallow-plunging, regional syncline. On BLACKSTONE the west-trending southern portion of the unit forms a belt up to 12 km long and 2 km wide, where it defines the southern limb of a syncline cored by younger units of the Tollu Group. This southern limb most likely continues westward to underlie ~80 km&sup2; of the Mount Blythe area on COOPER, and east to MacDougall Bluff (southeastern BLACKSTONE), where the Kunmarnara Group and its external and internal contacts are well exposed. Metamorphosed equivalents of the Kunmarnara Group are interpreted to form west-northwesterly trending upright folds within a 38 km &times; 10 km fault-bounded block that straddles the boundary between the northern portions of FINLAYSON and HOLT.   The MacDougall Formation forms low outcrops and linear ridges in dune country. In lower lying areas, the unit forms saprolitic or limonitic ferricrete mounds, and may underlie plains of abundant quartz colluvium sourced from its vein-quartz pebbles. The Mummawarrawarra Basalt forms significant hills only when unmetamorphosed, which is the case along the southern limb of the Blackstone Syncline at MacDougall Bluff and Mummawarrawarra Hill (on central BLACKSTONE), and south of Mount Blythe on COOPER. Elsewhere, the Mummawarrawarra Basalt forms low hills, rubbly mounds, or appears as mesoscopic xenoliths enclosed in the better exposed, layered gabbros of the oldest mafic Giles Suite intrusions (P_-WKG).  In the northwestern corner of BENTLEY the MacDougall Formation is exposed along prominent north-trending ridges, 6 km long and 400 m wide that form the limbs of a large west-verging tight to isoclinal overturned fold. The northeast-trending Bedford Range in the northwestern corner of DIORITE similarly exposes quartzite dominated ridges of the MacDougall Formation. Migmatitic paragneisses and small scattered outcrops of garnet-bearing metabasalt in the south-central part of DIORITE, eight kilometres southwest of Wanarn, represent the high-pressure granulite equivalent to the MacDougall Formation and Mummawarrawarra Basalt, respectively.","The name  Kunmarnara Group  was first used by Smithies et al. (2009) and is named after Kunmarnara Bore, which is located approximately 4 km east of MacDougall Bluff and 10 km north of Skirmish Hill, in the southeast of BLACKSTONE.",,"Daniels (1974) placed the MacDougall Formation and Mummawarrawarra Basalt at the bottom of the Tollu Group, noting that inclusions of the Mummawarrawarra Basalt could be found in the mafic-ultramafic rocks of the Giles intrusions. However, radiometric dating of rocks that crosscut the Kunmarnara units and of the Smoke Hill Volcanics (interpreted by Daniels (1974) to lie conformably above the Kunmarnara Group), required the Kunmarnara units to be split from the overlying Tollu Group (Smithies et al., 2009). Close et al. (2003) tentatively correlated the Kunmarnara units with lower units of the Tjauwata Group in the Bloods Range of the Northern Territory. Nevertheless, the c. 1075 Ma Puntitjata Rhyolite within the Tjauwata Group may actually post-date many of the Giles intrusions.  The pristine, fine- to coarse-grained, muddy to arkosic, poorly sorted sandstones, and matrix-supported conglomerates of the MacDougall Formation (P_-KRd-sg) are preserved in the Blackstone syncline at MacDougall Bluff (BLACKSTONE) and at Mount Blythe (COOPER). At Mount Blythe, cross-bedding in layers, 1 to 10 m thick, show paleocurrent indicators that suggest a depositional system flowing away from the Blackstone syncline area (Daniels, 1974). The majority of pebbles contained within the MacDougall Formation are of vein quartz. The source of this vein quartz remains enigmatic as quartz veins are not abundant in the basement. On the other hand, quartz veins often crosscut the MacDougall Formation, being most abundant in regions of the west Musgrave Province where the Kunmarnara Group is exposed.  Rocks of the MacDougall Formation are metamorphosed to a transitional greenschist-amphibolite facies (P_-KRd-mxsm) and mylonitized (P_-KRd-mxym) along the northern margin (and to the north) of the Finlay Range (HOLT). Daniels (1974) considered these rocks to be older than the Bentley Supergroup due to their deformation and metamorphic grade. However, their compositional similarity to the rocks described above, and their stratigraphic position with respect to the Giles intrusions, indicates they are most likely the metamorphosed equivalent of the MacDougall Formation. These rocks typically range from phyllitic over meta-arkosic to quartzitic, depending on the muscovite and feldspar content. Centimetre-scale lenses of magnetite are locally abundant. Near some of the layered mafic Giles intrusions, the growth of small, 1 mm-long diameter garnet crystals overprints a consistently dextral-normal C-S fabric defined by muscovite (C-planes) and recrystallized quartz (S-planes). This relationship suggests that the sediments were deformed before the emplacement of the Giles intrusions. However, the opposite relationship is observed where the rocks are mylonitized at the basal contact of the MacDougall Formation in southeast FINLAYSON, which is indicative of later shearing along this anisotropy. At the junction between BENTLEY, GOLDEN POINT, TABLE POINT, and DIORITE and extending onto DICKENSON, the MacDougall Formation is mainly subdivided into a muscovite-quartzite-dominated component (P_-KRd-mhs) and a quartzofeldspathic-dominated component (P_-KRd-mhe). In the northwestern corner of BENTLEY, the MacDougall Formation is locally metamorphosed to upper amphibolite facies and contains garnet-kyanite metamorphic assemblage in the core of a west-verging fold and thrust system. The Wanarn area lies in the central part of DIORITE and represents a wedge structure bounded by the Mitika Fault and the Woodroffe Thrust that exposes garnet-bearing psammitic gneisses (P_-KRd-mtn) and granofels (P_-KRd-mtn), and garnet-bearing metabasalt (P_-KRm-mbb), interpreted to represent the high-pressure granulite facies equivalent to the MacDougall Formation and Mummawarrawarra Basalt, respectively.   The Mummawarrawarra Basalt comprises a stack of individual 1 to 5 m-thick flow units that range in composition from basaltic to andesitic, which is mostly basaltic andesite. The layers range from massive and nonamygdaloidal to very amygdaloidal and from nonporphyritic to plagioclase-porphyritic. Amygdales have locally coalesced to form pockets or layers parallel to flow-layering. Pipe vesicles are locally present. In thin section, the Mummawarrawarra Basalt (P_-KRm-bbg) is a fine-grained hypocrystalline and seriate-textured rock, comprising acicular to lath-shaped plagioclase, relict clinopyroxene, rare olivine phenocrysts, and an interstitial glassy groundmass with lobate amygdales (now quartz, epidote, and chlorite).  The rock locally contains up to 10% euhedral plagioclase phenocrysts and glomerocrysts, both up to 8 mm in size, within a subophitic matrix. Macroscopically, this plagioclase-phyric microgabbro is difficult to distinguish from later plagioclase-phyric gabbros (P_-WKG to P_-WKal-o), dykes, and sills, which intrude it to form a mixed unit (P_-KRm-xmb-mo).  Mafic minerals in the Mummawarrawarra Basalt are variably to completely altered to actinolite or epidote, particularly adjacent to mafic intrusions of the Giles Suite. Where metamorphosed, the Mummawarrawarra Basalt is characterized by a strong aeromagnetic (TMI) response, while in locations where epidote alteration predominates, the unit is nonmagnetic.","The association of coarse-grained, fluvial sedimentary rocks (MacDougall Formation), basaltic andesites, and andesites with a high-K intraplate geochemistry (Mummawarrawarra Basalt), seen in the Kunmarnara Group, suggests deposition in an intracontinental rift-type setting.",1,700,,"The lower contact of the Kunmarnara Group is best exposed in central-western BLACKSTONE and in central-eastern BLACKSTONE, where rocks of the MacDougall Formation unconformably overlie metamorphosed granitic rocks of the Wankanki Supersuite. The lower contact is also completely exposed on a small hill in southeast FINLAYSON and at Mount Blythe on COOPER. The former exposure is a faulted unconformity, being present between mylonitized and brecciated rocks of the MacDougall Formation (P_-KRd-mxym) and metamorphosed granites of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite. The latter is an unconformity between sandstones of the MacDougall Formation (P_-KRd-sg) and mylonitic high-grade gneisses of the Wirku Metamorphics. A sill of Mummawarrawarra Basalt intrudes along this unconformity, joining feeder dykes to the main flows overlying the MacDougall Formation. The upper contact of the Kunmarnara Group is not exposed, and is interpreted to have been above the current exposure level of the Musgrave Province. The Mummawarrawarra Basalt is typically intruded by sills and layered chambers, up to 10 km thick, which form the oldest mafic intrusions of the Giles Suite (P_-WKG).  In the Mitika and Wanarn areas, the MacDougall Formation is interpreted to lie uncomformably over Mesoproterozoic rocks of the Musgrave Province. However, this contact is rarely well exposed. In contrast, mylonitic contacts between paragneisses of the MacDougall Formation (P_-KRd-mtn) and orthogneisses of the c. 1600 Ma Warlawurru Supersuite (P_-WR-mg) are well exposed 7 km southwest of Wanarn. This is interpreted as a tectonic sliver of Musgrave Province basement, emplaced into the MacDougall Formation during the 580-520 Ma Petermann Orogeny.",,17,,,Mixed,2,,,,1085,,1075,,"A total of nine samples from the MacDougall Formation were collected throughout the west Musgrave Region to investigate the detrital zircon age spectra of this formation (Evins et al., 2010; GSWA 201311, Kirkland et al., 2014a; GSWA 194806, Kirkland et al., 2014b; GSWA 205194, Kirkland et al., 2014c; GSWA 208414, Kirkland et al., 2014d; GSWA 185414, Kirkland et al., 2014e; GSWA 201307, Kirkland et al., 2014f; Quentin de Gromard et al., 2016). Combined, the nine samples show a dominant Musgrave Orogeny peak at c. 1179 Ma and other significant age components at c. 1611, 1566, 1505, 1428, and 1405 Ma (Quentin de Gromard et al., 2016). Interestingly, all samples of the MacDougall Formation lack detrital zircons of the voluminous Wankanki Supersuite of the 1345-1293 Ma Mount West Orogeny.  The maximum depositional age of the MacDougall Formation is constrained by the youngest detrital zircon age component of c. 1179 Ma. A more realistic maximum age is the c. 1085 Ma regional maximum age of magmatism associated with the Giles Event (Edgoose et al., 2004; Evins et al., 2010), which must be nearly coeval with the onset of the Ngaanyatjarra Rift and the deposition of the Kunmarnara Group.  A direct date from layered mafic intrusive rocks of the Giles Suite emplaced within the Mummawarrawarra Basalt yielded a magmatic crystallization age of 1076 Â± 7 Ma (GSWA 194762, Kirkland et al., 2011b). Sun et al. (1996) obtained an age of 1078 Â± 3 Ma from a granitic layer within the layered Bell Rock intrusion. Hence, an age range of 1078-1075 Ma can be inferred for these layered intrusions. It can also be interpreted as a minimum age of deposition of the Mummawarrawarra Basalt (Smithies et al., 2009).  A c. 630 Ma metamorphic zircon rim growth event is reported in the northwestern corner of BENTLEY (GSWA 205194, Kirkland et al., 2014c; GSWA 208414, Kirkland et al., 2014d). It is coeval with the muscovite crystallization age in quartzite of the MacDougall Formation (GSWA 185414, Kirkland et al., 2013) and with the zircon crystallization age in pegmatites elsewhere in the Musgrave Province (GSWA 187175, Kirkland et al., 2011a).",No,,,7,,No,Submitted,Yes,Yes,P_,KR,,,,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

The lowermost unit is called the Lake Douglas Conglomerate Member and comprises polymictic, clast-supported, conglomerates and minor sandstones. Clasts types include banded iron-formation, granite, quartzite and mafic volcanic rocks. The upper member is the Seven Mile Sandstone Member (~1300 m thick) and is dominated by massive to cross-bedded quartzofeldspathic sandstones. The sedimentary rocks were deposited post-D1, but are folded by D2 (after Swager et al., 1992) and are exposed in the northwest to north northwest-trending Kurrawang Syncline 15 km west of Kalgoorlie. The Kurrawang Formation is part of the &ldquo;Late Basin&rdquo; history of the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane, however the provenance is likely to be associated with significant crustal recycling in the Youanmi Terrane.","The formation is exposed in a 78 km long, northwest to north northwest-trending basin called the Kurrawang Syncline, 15 km to the west of Kalgoorlie. The northern limit of the basin is at the southern tip of the Siberia Monzogranite (DAVYHURST), and extends southward to the area between Lake Douglas and Red Lake on KALGOORLIE.",Locally there are several sites that incorporate the name &ldquo;Kurrawang&rdquo;. These include a nature reserve and an aboriginal community and buildings.,,"The Kurrawang Formation has two dominant facies. The lowermost facies is a polymictic conglomerate with subordinate sandstone units, called the Lake Douglas Conglomerate Member. The conglomerate can have a distinctive high-magnetic response on aeromagnetic images. Conglomeratic beds are generally clast-supported, with well-rounded clasts ranging in size from a maximum 25 cm to an average size range of 5 to 10 cm (Hunter, 1993). The clast lithologies are diverse and include: banded iron-formation (some with pre-depositional folds and cross-cutting quartz veins), chert, quartzite (some fuchscitic), granitic to gneissic, felsic volcanic, and rare clasts of metasandstone, ultramafic, mafic and amphibolite. Hunter (1993) writes &ldquo;There is no systematic distribution of clast size or type on a regional basis, with the exception of abundant banded iron-formation clasts which are confined to an extensive 30 m thick horizon on KALGOORLIE&rdquo;.   The matrix of the conglomerate is a grey to khaki coloured, medium- to coarse-grained sandstone or, less commonly siltstone. It is immature, poorly sorted and is similar in composition to the intercalated sandstones. The matrix exhibits a wrap-around texture to clasts at all scales, and  feathering  of matrix and clasts occurs at pressure-shadow terminations. In the matrix there is a predominance of subangular lithic grains accompanied by quartz and feldspar. The lithic grains have compositions similar to those of the megaclasts. Metamorphic biotite is abundant and constitutes a distinct, anastomosing foliation. Other minerals present in the matrix include chlorite, epidote, euhedral magnetite, zircon, and rare tourmaline (Hunter, 1993). Minor chlorite and white mica are interpreted to be part of retrograde alteration (Sircombe et al., 2007).   The second dominant facies is a poorly exposed quartzofeldspathic sandstone (Seven Mile Sandstone Member) with a thickness of approximately 1300m (Hunter 1993). Rare outcrops reveal thin- to medium-bedded quartz-rich sandstones with normal grading. Less common are siltstone, black shale and sandstones with a pebble lag. Sedimentary structures include planar and tough cross-bedding, flame and ball-and-pillow structures where mudstones are present.    Between the two facies there is a transition zone of a broadly fining-upwards sequence of pebbly conglomerates, pebbly sandstones and intercalated sandstones with an approximate thickness of 20 metres (Hunter 1993). The well rounded, pebble-sized clasts in this intermediary zone comprise granite, felsic volcanic, quartzite and siltstone. The sandstones are lenticular in form and display low angle cross-bedding. ","KrapeÅ¾ et al (2008) interpreted the depositional setting for the sedimentary rocks as a south-east orientated proximal submarine canyon feed by a fluvial system from a source west of the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane. Alternatively, Hunter (1993) writes &ldquo;that deposition began in a fluctuating high energy, proximal environment, which waned with time. The conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone are interpreted as having formed in a stream-dominated, alluvial fan system (Bull, 1972). The thicker conglomerate horizons probably represent debris-flow deposition, whereas the thinner and discontinuous horizons represent lag deposits in alluvial channels. The succeeding sandstones show progressively greater sorting and grading, and may represent distal facies of the alluvial fan system. Alternatively, the distal environment may have been subaqueous with the fan prograding to a braided-river system or fan delta.&rdquo;",,2000,,"The lower conglomeratic unit of the Kurrawang Formation has an angular discordance with the underlying Navajo Sandstone. Field relationships and broad-scale regional map patterns indicate minor tilting of the Navajo Sandstone prior to deposition of the Kurrawang Formation (Hunter, 1993; KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2008). The top of the formation has no overlying strata. The only known intrusive relationship is with Paleoproterozoic mafic dykes of the Widgiemooltha Dolerite.",,17,,,,4,,,,2657,,2640,,"Isotopic dating of the Kurrawang Formation has been undertaken by several authors. Squire et al. (2010) interpret the depositional age of the formation to be c. 2658-2655 Ma., which is in conflict with the study by KrapeÅ¾ et al. (2000) which suggests the maximum depositional age is &le; 2655 Ma. Mixture modelling of SHRIMP results by Sircombe et al. (2007) provides a maximum depositional age of 2657 Â± 7 Ma. In the absence of any cross-cutting igneous intrusions, other than the mafic dykes of the early Paleoproterozoic Widgiemooltha Dolerite, the minimum age of the Kurrawang Formation is very difficult to constrain, but must be after D2 folding (after Swager et al., 1992).   Squire (2010) infers the minimum age to be c. 2655 Ma by correlating structural fabrics, and metamorphic grade of the formation to regional geotectonic models (e.g. Goscombe et al., 2009; Blewett et al., 2010) in conjunction with U-Pb SHRIMP data. Sampling a quartz-rich sedimentary unit from the Kurrawang Formation, Squires et al. (2010) used LA-ICP-MS techniques to analysis multiple zircons. The data yielded a significant range in ages from 3576 Â± 36, to less than 2600 Ma. The data also supported the inference that provenance was likely to be external to the Kalgoorlie Terrane, as indicated by the range of clast types in the conglomeratic units, especially the presence of band iron-formation.   Sircombe et al. (2007) sampled an altered grey sandstone intercalated at the top of the Lake Douglas Conglomerate Member. The oldest inherited grain yielded an age of 3641 Â± 4 Ma, while the bulk of acceptable analyses clustered between 2750 and 2650 Ma. Mixture modelling yielded several components, with the lowest at 2657 Â± 7 Ma, which was tentatively interpreted as the maximum age of deposition.   KrapeÅ¾ et al. (2000) analysed three samples from the Kurrawang Formation for SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages. A range of detrital zircon ages were yielded, with the oldest age at 3567 Â± 5 Ma. From their results, KrapeÅ¾ et al (2000) suggested that the maximum age for the formation must be &le; 2655 Ma, which was also taken as the initialization of D2 (after Swager et al., 1992), which deforms the Kurrawang Formation. A deformation history presented by Swager et al., (1992) has an early (D1) south-over-north recumbent folding event which is not seen in the Kurrawang Formation. However, subsequent ENE-SWS shortening (D2) which produced regional upright folds and a regional NNW-trending foliation, is seen in late basin sedimentary unit.

Blewett and others (2004) interpret two compressive events, D2a and D2b to be separated by a short extensional event (D2E).

1065,74873,A-ANla-xony-am,571,Lady Alma Igneous Complex,1,"Layered gabbro and anorthosite, with magnetitite and pyroxenite layers, and thick ultramafic cumulates; metamorphosed","The Lady Alma Igneous Complex is a mafic-ultramafic layered intrusion belonging to the Meeline Suite (Ivanic et al. 2010). The Complex forms a northwest-trending, lens-shaped outcrop 21 km long and 5 km wide (~62 km 2 ) and is moderately (~50&deg;) southwest-dipping. With greater abundance of ultramafic lithologies to the northeast and local observations of igneous modal layering, it is interpreted to be southwest facing. It is intruded in between and oriented parallel to bedding in Norie Group volcanic and sedimentary rocks and is truncated to the south by Big Bell Suite metagranitic rocks. Though disrupted by internal shear zones, it comprises approximately 2.5 km thickness of igneous cumulate stratigraphy. It is the northernmost complex of the Meeline Suite, within the central Youanmi Terrane, western Yilgarn Craton. This Complex is located about 25 km to the northwest of the Barrambie Igneous Complex. Due to poor exposure and structural complication, this Complex is not divided into zones. Geochemically, this Complex is thought to be anhydrous and tholeiitic (Ivanic et al. 2010). The upper parts of the Complex host significant vanadiferous magnetitite horizons.","The Complex is 21 km long and 5 km wide, lens-shaped and aligned along a northwest strike. It crosses from the northernmost NOWTHANNA to the southern GABANINTHA map sheets with its main exposures situated a few kilometres west and south of the Gabanintha homestead. The Complex is thickest in its central part and tapers off to the northwest where it is attenuated into thin lenses adjacent to an increasing proportion of basaltic rocks of the Polelle Group.","The Complex has previously been referred to as the Gabanintha Complex (Mathison and Ahmat, 1996). The type section is located 1 km west of the Gabanintha homestead from site MVKGLN060012 (Zone 50 MGA 663480E 7021190N) to site MVKGLN060029 (Zone 50 MGA 661958E 7018929N). This traverse to the southwest starts in metaperidotite, a dunitic schist, and proceeds into serpentine-rich metaperidotite, both of which preserve olivine cumulate texture in a few places. Between 1 and 1.5 km into the traverse gabbro/dolerite and actinolite-rich pyroxenite are encountered. At site SXWWAN000062 (Zone 50 MGA 662304E 7020259N) a coarse leucogabbro is reported (Wang, 1998; sample 96631). Immediately west of this site is a coarse to pegmatitic pyroxenite. Towards the end of the traverse, poorly exposed and strongly lateritized intrusive rocks dominate. These are dominantly magnetitite and magnetite-bearing leucogabbro. Igneous layering, though not measured at surface is inferred to be very steep to vertically dipping.",,"The lithological constituents of this Complex are biased towards ultramafic cumulate rocks (about half of the outcrop) compared to other intrusions of the Meeline Suite. In central to westerly parts of the Complex, magnetite-absent gabbroic rocks form about a quarter, and towards the western margin magnetite-bearing gabbroic rocks form the remaining quarter. This provides a southwesterly overall igneous differentiation vector and, though not continuous, likely represents approximately 2.5 km of igneous stratigraphy (Ivanic et al. 2010). This Complex is not divided into zones because of structural complication throughout and, compared to other Meeline Suite intrusions, it is missing a large fraction of its gabbroic stratigraphy. Texturally, few examples of cumulate textures are observed throughout the stratigraphy of the Complex. Peridotitic to pyroxenitic rocks have coarse mesocumulate to pegmatitic textures, gabbroic rocks have ophitic to subophitic to medium grained textures and magnetite-rich rocks have dominantly recrystallized textures. Magnetitites, specifically, are typically altered to martite, goethite, ilmenite, and rutile, especially adjacent to laterites. Ilmenite and apatite are present as accessory phases in uppermost parts of the Complex.",,,,,"The Complex intrudes into deformed and metamorphosed units of the Norie Group, which include banded iron-formation, psammitic siliciclastic rocks and felsic volcanic. The Complex is crosscut by a small pluton of  internal granite  likely belonging to the Cullculli Suite in the northeast and is truncated to the south by a metagranitic pluton of Big Bell Suite to the west (A-SDB-mgms).

3920,77927,A-_kd-scp,3919,Lake Douglas Conglomerate Member,1,"Conglomerate, sandy conglomerate, and pebbly sandstone; metamorphosed","The Lake Douglas ConglomerateMember comprises polymictic clast-supported conglomerates, with minor intercalated pebbly sandstones, and sandstones up to 750m thick. The clasts are well rounded coarse pebbles to granule size and show a wide range of lithotypes from banded iron-formation, granite, quartzite to mafic volcanics. Palaeocurrent studies and the abundance of banded iron-formation clasts suggest the provenance is likely to be associated with significant crustal recycling in the Youanmi Terrane to the west. The sedimentary rocks are exposed in the northwest to north northwest-trending Kurrawang Syncline 15 km west of Kalgoorlie. The Kurrawang Formation is part of the &ldquo;Late Basin&rdquo; history of the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane.","The unit is exposed around the margin of a 78 km long, northwest to north northwest-trending syncline, 15 km west of Kalgoorlie. The northern limit of the basin is at the southern tip of the Siberia Monzogranite (DAVYHURST map sheet), southward to the area between Lake Douglas and Red Lake on the southwest KALGOORLIE","The name is derived from a paleo-salt lake called Lake Douglas, which is located at the southern end of the Kurrawang Syncline (KALGOORLIE).",,"The lowermost member of the Kurrawang Formation is a polymictic conglomerate with subordinate sandstone units. The conglomerate unit can have a distinctive high-magnetic response on aeromagnetic images due to a high percentage of banded iron-formation clasts. Conglomeratic beds are typically clast-supported, with well-rounded clasts ranging in size from a maximum 25 cm to an average size range of 5 to 10 cm (Hunter, 1993). The clast lithologies are diverse and include; banded iron-formation (some with pre-depositional folds and cross-cutting quartz veins), chert, quartzite (some fuchscitic), granitic to gneissic, felsic volcanic and rare metasandstone, ultramafic, mafic and amphibolite. Hunter (1993) writes, &ldquo;There is no systematic distribution of clast size or type on a regional basis, with the exception of abundant banded iron-formation clasts which are confined to an extensive, 30 m thick horizon on KALGOORLIE&rdquo;.   KrapeÅ¾ et al. (2008) identified three major lithofacies within the member. These include: a) stratified clast-supported conglomerates with a tabular geometry and are the most abundant lithofacies; b) channel-bound, matrix-supported conglomerate with poor stratification which grade to sandstone and; c) sandstones with a variety of sedimentary features (e.g., massive to ripple cross-laminated, pebble lags, lenses of laminated mudstones).    The matrix of the conglomerate is a grey to khaki coloured, medium- to coarse-grained sandstone or, rarely, siltstone. It is immature, poorly sorted and is similar in composition to the interbedded sandstones. The matrix exhibits a wrap-around texture to clasts at all scales, and  feathering  of matrix and clasts occurs at pressure-shadow terminations due to a solid state deformation. In the matrix there is a predominance of subangular lithic grains accompanied by quartz and feldspar. The lithic grains have compositions similar to those of the megaclasts. Metamorphic biotite is abundant and constitutes a distinct, anastomosing foliation. Other minerals present in the matrix include chlorite, epidote, euhedral magnetite, zircon, and rare tourmaline (Hunter, 1993). Minor chlorite and white mica are interpreted to be part of retrograde alteration (Sircombe et al., 2007). ","KrapeÅ¾ et al (2008) suggested the depositional setting was a south-east orientated proximal submarine canyon feed by a fluvial system from a source west of the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane. Alternatively, Hunter (1993) suggested deposition began in a fluctuating high energy, proximal environment, which waned with time. The conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone were interpreted as having formed in a stream-dominated, alluvial fan system. The thicker conglomerate horizons probably represent debris-flow deposition, whereas the thinner and discontinuous horizons represent lag deposits in alluvial channels.",,750,,"The lower conglomeratic unit of the Kurrawang Formation has an angular discordance with the underlying Navajo Sandstone. Field relationships and broad-scale regional map patterns indicate minor tilting of the Navajo Sandstone prior to deposition of the Kurrawang Formation (Hunter, 1993; KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2008).

Gabbro, which has been metamorphosed to medium- to coarse-grained amphibolite, is the most common rock type. It intrudes mainly above the stratigraphic level of the Maggie Hays Formation (A-_mh-xbb-s) and below the Honman Formation (A-_hm-c). Metamorphism is typically in the greenschist or amphibolite facies, with amphibolite dominant.","The Lake Medcalf Igneous Complex forms continuous sills and lenses that intrude at least the lower part of the stratigraphy in the Lake Johnston greenstone belt, which extends in a southeasterly direction from central LAKE PERCY to central TAY. The igneous complex is poorly exposed, particularly in the south, where it has an apparent thickness of up to 1500 m in the Lake Medcalf area, on southern JOHNSTON. Gravity and aeromagnetic images suggest that the igneous complex is thickest at its southern end, on northern TAY. Here the intrusion appears to be relatively flat lying, in contrast to the moderately to steeply dipping succession north from Mount Gordon (Zone 51, MGA 286298E 6404594N) to north of Maggie Hays Hill (Zone 51, MGA 272514E 6425450N). On JOHNSTON and ROUNDTOP, sills are strongly sheared and transposed parallel to the main northwesterly trend of the greenstone belt. Thickness is variable, although some of the apparent thickness may be due to structural repetition where shearing has transposed and boudinaged the sills.","The Lake Medcalf Igneous Complex is named after Lake Medcalf (Zone 51, MGA 294957E 6404860N). The most complete and well-preserved exposures are in the Lake Medcalf area south of Bremer Range on TAY (from SSRTAY000080, Zone 51, MGA 295450E 6398516N to SSRTAY000084, Zone 51, MGA 295565E 6398555N), which is the type area.",,"The poorly exposed Lake Medcalf Igneous Complex contains variably deformed and metamorphosed mafic intrusive rocks including metamorphosed gabbro, pyroxenite, dolerite and minor leucogabbro. The main rock type is medium- to coarse-grained amphibolite after gabbro, composed predominantly of strongly recrystallized plagioclase and hornblende (e.g. SSRJHS0000698, Zone 51, MGA 272557E 6425673N). Dolerite, which may represent feeders to the main gabbroic body, is metamorphosed to fine- to medium-grained hornblende-bearing amphibolite or actinolite-bearing metadolerite.  Medium- to coarse-grained amphibolite after leucogabbro and pyroxenite of the Lake Medcalf Igneous Complex is exposed in the type area south of Bremer Range on TAY (from SSRTAY000080, Zone 51, MGA 295450E 6398516N to SSRTAY000084, Zone 51, MGA 295565E 6398555N). Strongly deformed, coarse-grained amphibolite is well exposed on the western side of Maggie Hays Hill (e.g. SSRJHS000700, Zone 51, MGA 272542E 6425638N). Metamorphosed pyroxenite (e.g. SSRJHS0000606, Zone 51, MGA 267296E 6429354N) is locally recrystallized to chlorite-tremolite schist (e.g. CFGKJ000102, Zone 51, MGA 267391E 6442201N).  The Lake Medcalf Igneous Complex has been metamorphosed in the amphibolite or, less commonly, greenschist facies. Rare hornfels and granulite facies assemblages are present along granite-greenstone contacts. For example, hornfels and mafic granulite after gabbro are preserved along a contact with granodiorite on the western shoreline of Lake Johnston, north of Maggie Hays Hill (SSRJHS001327, Zone 51, MGA 271929E 6427291N).

The formation is conformable with the underlying Valentine Siltstone and with the overlying Luman Siltstone. It is a thick succession of feldspathic sandstone and arkose with minor, or locally dominant, occurrences of quartz sandstone. Siltstone units are common within the formation. Rare pebble conglomerates are seen. A maximum depositonal age of 1860 Â± 6 Ma has been obtained for the formation (Kirkland et al., 2010), though the true depositional age is likely to be 1835 Ma, based on the age of a felsic volcaniclastic from the underlying Valentine Siltstone (Page and Sun, 1994; Sheppard et al., 2012).","The Lansdowne Arkose is exposed in a thin belt of the Speewah Basin along the northeast and northwest edges of the western zone of the Lamboo Province. The formation may be found on the CAMBRIDGE GULF, LISSADELL, DIXON RANGE, LANSDOWNE, MOUNT RAMSAY, LENNARD RIVER, CHARNLEY, and YAMPI 1:250 000 map sheets. The formation is made of a dominantly resistant lithology producing cliff faces, ridges, cusestas, and hogbacks of moderate elevation.","The Lansdowne Arkose is probably named after Lansdowne Homestead (Lat. -17&deg; 36' 49'' S, Long. 126&deg; 44' 42'' E) on the LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 map sheet. The formation was first described in the first edition of the DIXON RANGE 1:250 000 explanatory notes, Sheet SE/52-6 (Dow and Gemuts, 1967).",,"The Lansdowne Arkose is a medium- to coarse-grained feldspathic sandstone and arkose with interbedded medium- to coarse-grained quartz sandstone (Dow and Gemuts, 1967; Roberts et al., 1968; Griffin et al., 1993; Thorne et al., 1999). Finer-grained lithologies, such as micaceous siltstone and shale, are also present. The formation is dominated by small- to medium-scale trough cross-stratification (Sheppard et al., 1999; Thorne et al., 1999) and also preserves slumps, ripples, and clay pellets with cross-bed foresets up to 1 m thick on the LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 sheet (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967). There are no formal members within the Lansdowne Arkose but the formation has been subdivided on different map sheets with no obvious correlation between these subdivisions (differences appear to be local). On the LISSADELL 1:250 000 sheet the Lansdowne Arkose was found to have an upper and lower sandstone unit dominated by trough cross-stratification at all scales and abundant ripples (symmetrical, asymmetrical, and megaripples) separated by a mixed sandstone and siltstone unit (Thorne et al., 1999). Festoon cross-bedding is noted on the LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 sheet. On the LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 sheet the formation has been informally split into four siltstone and two sandstone units including in ascending order: 1. arkose and feldspathic sandstone, 2. siltstone, 3. feldspathic sandstone and arkose, 4. siltstone, 5. feldspathic sandstone, and 6. arkose and quartz sandstone (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967). The formation contains prominent granule and pebble conglomerates on the MOUNT RAMSAY 1:250 000 sheet (Roberts et al., 1968) but these lithofacies appear to be restricted to this map sheet.  Cross-bedding within the Lansdowne Arkose suggests a paleoflow from the northeast on the LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 sheet (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967) and dominantly from the northeast and east on the LISSADELL 1:250 000 sheet, although local bipolar current directions are noted in the lower sandstone unit (Thorne et al., 1999).","The abundance of thick-bedded, cross-bedded, coarse-grained sandstones with asymmetrical current structures suggests a fluvial or shallow marine depositional setting. Festoon cross-bedding (characteristic of the formation on the LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 sheet) is common in fluvial systems. The bipolar currents and symmetrical ripple laminations within the lower sandstone unit on the LISSADELL 1:250 000 sheet suggest marine influence at this stratigraphic level (Thorne et al., 1999).",150,488,,The Lansdowne Arkose is part of a continuously sedimentary succession in the Speewah Group.

This is older than felsic volcanic rocks from the Whitewater Volcanics which unconformably underlay the Speewah Group. The Whitewater Volcanics have yielded igneous crystallisation ages of 1857 Â± 4, 1854 Â± 5 (Griffin et al., 2000), 1854 Â± 6 (Lu et al., 2016) and 1849 Â± 6 Ma (Worden et al., 2008).  Detrital zircon geochronology from the Tunganary Formation, in the lower Speewah Group, reported a maximum depositional age from a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1814 Â± 10 Ma from a population of seven young grains with the youngest detrital zircon dated at 1803 Â± 12 Ma (1&sigma;) (GS11031-2, Ramsay et al., 2017).

The Leake Spring Metamorphics do not outcrop in the Mooloo and Paradise Zones at the southern end of the province. The metamorphic rocks pass, with decreasing metamorphic grade, into the Ashburton and Mount McGrath Formations to the north. The Leake Spring Metamorphics have a maximum depositional age of c. 1840 Ma, and were deposited before the 1820-1770 Ma Capricorn Orogeny and the intrusion of the associated Moorarie Supersuite.","The Leake Spring Metamorphics outcrop throughout the Boora Boora Zone at the northern end of the Gascoyne Province, where they pass, with decreasing metamorphic grade, into the Ashburton and Mount McGrath Formations of the Wyloo Group (Williams, 1986). The Leake Spring Metamorphics also outcrop in the Limejuice and Mutherbukin Zones. They are not recognized in the Mangaroon Zone owing to high-grade metamorphism and widespread deformation in that zone during the 1680-1620 Ma Mangaroon Orogeny. The Leake Spring Metamorphics have not been identified in the Mooloo and Paradise Zones at the southern end of the province, nor within the Errabiddy Shear Zone.  Many of the metasedimentary rocks previously assigned to the  Morrissey Metamorphic Suite  belong to metasedimentary packages that either pre-date the 2005-1950 Ma Glenburgh Orogeny (Moogie Metamorphics or Camel Hills Metamorphics) or postdate the 1820-1770 Ma Capricorn Orogeny (Pooranoo Metamorphics).","The Leake Spring Metamorphics are named after Leake Spring in the southwestern corner of MOUNT AUGUSTUS. This unit was previously known as the  Morrissey Metamorphic Suite  and, subsequently, the  Morrissey Metamorphics . The name Morrissey Metamorphic Suite was introduced by Williams et al. (1978) for a series of '...Proterozoic shelf and trough sediments' in the Gascoyne  Province , although a full definition was not given. Williams (1986) used the name to refer to a '&hellip;suite of metamorphosed and deformed sediments (and minor volcanics) which form a supracrustal sequence throughout the Gascoyne Province... it is intruded by early to middle Proterozoic granitoids, and is unconformably overlain by late-orogenic sediments of the Mount James Formation and Middle Proterozoic, post-orogenic sediments of the Bangemall Group.' Rocks of the Morrissey Metamorphic Suite were previously considered to be part of the Wyloo Group (Daniels, 1975; Gee, 1979). The suite was named after Morrissey Hill in the central part of the MOUNT PHILLIPS 1:250 000 sheet.  The Morrissey Metamorphic Suite was thought to correlate, and to have been contiguous, with lower grade rocks of the Ashburton Formation of the Wyloo Group to the north, and the Bryah and Yerrida Groups (formerly  Glengarry Group ) to the east-southeast (Daniels, 1975; Gee, 1979; Williams, 1986). These sedimentary packages were interpreted to have been deposited in a  geosynclinal  trough bounded by shelves along the edge of the Pilbara and Yilgarn cratons. Implicit in the use of the term Morrissey Metamorphic Suite, was the assumption that there was only one main tectonic event that overprinted the rocks &mdash; the Capricorn Orogeny; in other words, all medium- to high-grade metasedimentary rocks in the Gascoyne Complex were metamorphosed during the Capricorn Orogeny and, therefore, must belong to the Morrissey Metamorphic Suite.  The Morrissey Metamorphic Suite was renamed as the Morrissey Metamorphics by Martin et al. (2007) and Sheppard et al. (2007), and used in a more restricted sense to refer to siliciclastic sedimentary rocks, and minor mafic volcanic or high-level intrusive rocks, that were deposited across the northern two-thirds of the Gascoyne Province after c. 1840 Ma. Thse rocks were first deformed and metamorphosed during the 1820-1770 Ma Capricorn Orogeny and were intruded by voluminous granites of the Moorarie Supersuite. The term  Suite  was dropped because it is used for intrusive igneous rocks with a close association in time, space, and origin.",,"The bulk of the Leake Spring Metamorphics comprises interlayered psammitic and pelitic schist, pelitic schist, subordinate psammitic schist and amphibolite, and minor calc-silicate rock, chert, ultramafic schist, and metamorphosed banded iron-formation. Pelitic and psammitic gneiss are rare. Interlayered psammitic and pelitic schist is particularly abundant in the Limejuice Zone where, in lower strain zones, graded bedding and quartzofeldspathic compositions suggest that the rocks may have originally been turbidites (e.g. around Leake Spring in the southwestern corner of MOUNT AUGUSTUS). Pelitic schists with assemblages comprising muscovite-biotite-quartz-plagioclase-garnet-iron oxide, staurolite-muscovite-biotite-quartz(-garnet), muscovite-biotite-quartz-plagioclase-magnetite, quartz-muscovite-biotite-plagioclase, and staurolite-garnet-biotite-muscovite(-andalusite) outcrop throughout the Limejuice Zone, and in the Mutherbukin Zone and the eastern end of the Boora Boora Zone.  Amphibolite lenses and thin layers, up to a few metres wide, are a widespread but volumetrically minor component of the Leake Spring Metamorphics. However, in the northwestern part and along the western edge of PINK HILLS, amphibolites are abundant. The margins of most of the amphibolites are either not exposed or are strongly sheared, but on PINK HILLS amphibolites locally preserve textures implying a volcanic or volcaniclastic origin (see P_-LS-mwa and P_-LS-xmh-mwa). Calc-silicate rock and ultramafic schist (actinolite schist and actinolite-chlorite-sericite schist) are widespread, but very minor, rock types, whereas chert and metamorphosed banded iron-formation have very restricted distributions.",,,,,"The Leake Spring Metamorphics are extensively intruded by numerous granites of the 1820-1775 Ma Moorarie Supersuite, particularly in the Limejuice and Boora Boora Zones. Additionally, in the Mutherbukin Zone, and to a lesser extent in the Boora Boora and Limejuice Zones, the Leake Spring Metamorphics are intruded by granites of the 1680-1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite. In the Nardoo Hills area along the northern edge of YINNETHARRA, the Leake Spring Metamorphics are intruded by granitic rocks of the 995-940 Ma Thirty Three Supersuite.  The relationship between the Leake Spring Metamorphics and the Moogie Metamorphics and Halfway Gneiss is unclear, as the latter two units largely outcrop only in the Mooloo and Paradise Zones, where the Leake Spring Metamorphics are absent. However, the Leake Spring Metamorphics are faulted against the Moogie Metamorphics and Halfway Gneiss on western PINK HILLS and adjacent eastern CANDOLLE. At the northern end of the Clever Mary Hills on southeastern PINK HILLS, psammitic and pelitic schists of the Leake Spring Metamorphics are inferred to unconformably overly Moogie Metamorphics and Halfway Gneiss, but the contact is not exposed.  The Leake Spring Metamorphics are unconformably overlain by the Pooranoo Metamorphics and by the Edmund Group. The relationship between the Leake Spring Metamorphics and Pooranoo Metamorphics is not well exposed. A probable, low-angle unconformity between the two is present near Reid Well on northeastern YINNETHARRA (Locality B15, Zone 50, MGA 430812E 7287905N; Martin et al., 2007). The relationship is best demonstrated in the Limejuice Zone where the Leake Spring Metamorphics are everywhere intruded by the Moorarie Supersuite, which is in turn unconformably overlain by several scattered outliers of the Pooranoo Metamorphics. The Leake Spring Metamorphics are unconformably overlain by the base of the Edmund Group over a wide area in both the Boora Boora and Limejuice Zones on MAROONAH and CANDOLLE, respectively. For example, an angular unconformity between crenulated schist of the Leake Spring Metamorphics and overlying pebbly sandstone of the Edmund Group is exposed about 250 m northwest of Peak Bore on CANDOLLE (site SXSCDL008288, Zone 50, MGA 514815E 2764748N).",,17,,,Mixed,2,,,,1842,,1807,3,"The maximum depositional age of the Leake Spring Metamorphics is constrained by results for two detrital zircon samples, whereas the minimum depositional age is provided by numerous granite intrusions of the Minnie Creek batholith and by a preliminary monazite age from pelitic schist along the northern edge of the Minnie Creek batholith.

The fine-grained siliciclastic rocks of the Lefroy Formation were deposited in a low-energy, predominantly sub-wavebase marine shelf environment. The Lefroy Formation conformably overlies the Townsend Quartzite and is unconformably overlain by the glacigenic Wahlgu Formation. It is probably a lateral correlative of the lower Browne Formation, although a contact between the Browne Formation and the Townsend Quartzite (which would confirm or deny the correlation) has not been observed in any drillhole.","The Lefroy Formation forms discontinuous outcrops on the southern side of the Brown Range and the Townsend Ridges, along the southern margin of the west Musgrave area on TALBOT. The Lefroy Formation is commonly poorly exposed with the best exposures being in the creek immediately south of Ainslie Gorge (Daniels, 1974), where the type section is located at MGA Zone 52, 263500E 7096500N on WARBURTON RANGE (Grey et al., 2005). The formation attains a thickness of about 240 m at the type locality (Jackson &amp; van de Graaff, 1981; Grey et al., 2005). On MOUNT EVELINE, thin sandstone layers of the Lefroy Formation form small linear outcrops, whereas shales and siltstones occur mainly as small rock chips scattered on the ground surface. Locally the bedding trend can be inferred from distinctive striped air-photo patterns where the formation is partly concealed by a shallow regolith cover. Wells BMR Talbot 3 and 4 near Warburton intersected about 25 m and 15 m respectively of siltstone and claystone that may be Lefroy Formation (Grey et al., 2005). Daniels (1971) also reported minor shales in the Townsend Quartzite on COOPER that may alternatively be Lefroy Formation.   In South Australia, a white-weathering shaly unit that may be a lateral equivalent of the Lefroy Formation is exposed at Pindyin Hills on LINDSAY (Jackson &amp; van de Graaff, 1981; Morton, 1997). This shaly unit is interpreted as a lower unit of the Alinya Formation (Zang, 1995) and has a thickness of about 200 m, comparable to the formation's type section (Grey et al, 2005). This correlation supports the continuity of the Lefroy Formation and lateral equivalents along the southern margin of the Musgrave Province (Jackson &amp; van de Graaff, 1981). Apak &amp; Moors (2000) also noted that it is possible that the shaly facies of the Lefroy Formation grades laterally into the sandy facies of the Townsend Quartzite.

The composite nature of the Lennard Granite suggests that it probably intruded over a period of time spanning the intrusion of some less extensive granite units. Many areas of granite previously included in the Lennard Granite (Derrick &amp; Playford, 1973; Gellatly et al., 1974) are reassigned to other existing units or to new units.","The Lennard Granite is a large composite unit consisting of many stocks which have intruded along the length of the Western Zone of the Lamboo Province in the West Kimberley. Compared to the older Mondooma Granite, which the Lennard Granite intrudes extensively, the Lennard Granite makes low hills as well as some whalebacks and tors.","The Lennard Granite is probably named after outcrops along the Lennard River, sourced in the King Leopold Ranges flowing roughly west to join the May River.",,"The Lennard Granite is a mottled grey-white, foliated, coarse-grained, porphyritic, leucocratic biotite metamonzogranite with minor metasyenogranite and metagranodiorite in even-grained phases (Tyler and Griffin, 1993). Non-porphyritic varieties occur locally. Foliations are defined by the alignment of pheonocrysts and platy xenoliths. Feldspar phenocrysts, dominated by large (up to 60 mm) K-feldspar crystals constitute up to half of the rock in some areas. The coarse- to medium-grained groundmass is dominated by anhedral K-feldspar with plagioclase, myrmekite, partly recrystallized quartz, minor biotite, and secondary sphene, 0.1-0.2 mm long (Gellatly et al., 1969; Tyler and Griffin, 1993; Griffin et al., 1993). Microcline forms anhedral perthitic crystals up to 10 mm long with irregular quartz up to 6 mm long. Subhedral to anhedral plagioclase form crystals 1-6 mm long with obvious zoning from andesine cores to oligoclase margins (Gellatly et al., 1969). Subhedral biotite flakes have been found altered to chlorite, muscovite, or secondary biotite. Contaminants of angular xenoliths of contact altered metasedimentary rocks are locally present (probably Marboo Formation; P_-PBln-gmi) with quartz xenocrysts with rims of mafic minerals (Gellatly and Halligan, 1971). Mafic inclusions, aligned with the foliation, are abundant locally. Thin aplite, pegmatite and quartz veins are widespread and are most abundant close to the contacts with granitoid (Griffin et al., 1993). The Lennard Granite locally resembles the Kongorow Granite but the latter is more mafic with fewer, more elgonate phenocrysts (Gellatly et al., 1969).  The Lennard Granite contains zones of prominent banding 1-2 m thick and up to 10 m long which grade into the non-banded, leucocratic granite. The banks are composed of alternations of biotite-poor and biotite-rich layers in fine- to medium-grained granite (Gellatly et al., 1969). These compositional bands may be the result of either xenolith recrystallization or primary magmatic layering (Gellatly et al., 1969).",,,,,"The Lennard Granite intrudes the Marboo Formation, Whitewater Volcanics, Mount Disaster Porphyry, Kongorow Granite, and Mondooma Granite.

The contacts with the Mondooma Granite are irregular but well-defined with xenolith-rich contact areas (P_-PBln-gmi). Xenoliths of Marboo Formation and Mondooma Granite are present. Veins of quartz, aplite, and pegmatite as well as rosettes of tourmaline, muscovite, and feldspar occur locally at the Lennard Granite-Mondooma Granite contact (Gellatly et al., 1969).

The Lilian Formation consists principally of fine-grained, low-energy facies rocks such as shales, mudstones, and quartzitic sandstones. The sandstones are commonly well-sorted and show a faint lamination. At the base and in the lower part of the Lilian Formation, microbial laminites and minor dolomitic shales are present. A realistic minimum age for the deposition of the Mission Group, and thus the Lilian Formation, is c. 1030 Ma (Close et al., 2003; Smithies et al., 2013; Quentin de Gromard et al., 2017).","The Lilian Formation forms a narrow, arcuate, southeast- to east-trending outcrop belt about 80 km long in the southwestern part of the west Musgrave Province. On WARBURTON RANGE, it forms low-lying outcrops in the central depression between the Brown Range in the south and the Warburton Range in the north, following partly the course of the Hughes Creek south of Ainslie Hill and tributaries of the Lilian Creek south of Snake Well. Further east, on MOUNT EVELINE, the Lilian Formation is exposed in an east-trending outcrop strip south of Frank Scott Hill and in another small outcrop segment 4.5 km north-northwest of Stony Hill. The outcrop width of the Lilian Formation perpendicular to strike is commonly about 1 km and the south-dipping succession has a thickness of about 400 m. A good exposure of the Lilian Formation is at a hill approximately 4 km to the southeast of Frank Scott Hill (MOUNT EVELINE).","The Lilian Formation was briefly described by Daniels (1974). It is presumably named after Lilian Creek, central on 1:250 000 sheet TALBOT. No type section has been designated.",,"The Lilian Formation principally consists of reddish-brown to olive-green shales and mudstones, which rarely show sedimentary structures (e.g. laminations) in outcrop. In some areas, e.g. southwest of Frank Scott Hill, these fine-grained rocks are mildly deformed and have developed a slaty cleavage. Near the base of the Lilian Formation thin (up to 20 cm) and laterally discontinuous quartzitic sandstones are intercalated within the shales and mudstones. These sandstones are commonly fine-grained, well-sorted, and show indistinct laminations. Some of the sandstones contain bluish-grey cherty mudstone clasts, which range from small and angular to large and irregular in shape (soft clasts?). Rare cherty microbial laminites with distorted layering are also present at the base of the Lilian Formation. These are comparable with the stromatolitic chert horizon that was reported by Daniels (1970, 1974) to contain possible silicified  Collenia  sp. Thin basaltic lavas mentioned by Daniels (1970, 1974) are probably shallowly intruded basaltic sills, as observed southwest of Frank Scott Hill, and thus are not part of the Lilian Formation. Minor dolomitic shales may be present in the lower part of the Lilian Formation, but calcareous intercalations in shales are more characteristic for the upper part of the Frank Scott Formation.   Polymictic conglomerates carrying abundant agate and rhyolite pebbles near Yeo Hill (Daniels 1970, 1974) and extremely poorly sorted sandstones and diamictites near Stony Hill (RHSMUG002821, Zone 52, MGA 328585E 7090140N) are currently included in and mapped as the uppermost part of the Lilian Formation. However, due to the coarse-grained and immature nature of these sedimentary rocks this stratigraphic interval should be excluded from the Lilian Formation, which is characterized by a generally fine-grained, low-energy sedimentary facies. Hence, these high-energy sandstones and conglomerates would be better placed at the base of the overlying and, in terms of facies, more closely related Milesia Formation, which contains immature fluvial sandstones and conglomerates as intercalations in basaltic lava flows. ",,,,,"The Lilian Formation conformably overlies the Frank Scott Formation. This contact appears fairly gradational in the field as both the upper part of the Frank Scott Formation and the main part of the Lilian Formation are dominated by shales and mudstones. However, in satellite images the contact between the two formations commonly appears relatively sharp and readily traceable. In the field the boundary is mainly characterized by a colour change of the shales and mudstones. In the Frank Scott Formation they are greyish when fresh (due to local enrichment in organic material) and commonly weather to turquoise shades. In contrast, the shales and mudstones of the Lilian Formation are ochreous to olive-green when fresh, but weather to distinct reddish-brown colours. Another aid to define the boundary between these two formations is the distribution of carbonates. The upper part of the Frank Scott Formation contains isolated lenses and ellipsoidal bodies of partly stromatolitic limestones, whereas the Lilian Formation is essentially devoid of carbonates. The stratigraphic level of the boundary is also marked by prominent dolerite sill (former Hughes Formation of Sofoulis, 1962), e.g. at Ainslie Hill and Frank Scott Hill.   The boundary with the overlying Milesia Formation appears largely conformable, but locally the contact could be erosional. It is characterized by a rapid change from fine-grained, low energy sedimentary deposits (shales and mudstones) to coarse-grained, high-energy deposits (coarse sandstones and conglomerates) and subaerial basaltic lava flows",,17,,,,4,,,,1057,,1030,,"Constraints on the maximum depositional age of the Mission Group are derived from the crystallization age of the underlying Thomas Rhyolite of the Cassidy Group.

However, it is likely that zircons within this sample included a large number of antecrysts and that the quoted mean age should be regarded as a maximum age for rhyolite volcanism (Smithies et al., 2013). Constraints on the minimum depositional age of the Mission Group are from the 825-800 Ma depositional age for the Bitter Springs Formation (Maidment et al., 2007), which overlies equivalents of the Townsend Quartzite in the Amadeus Basin.

It is comprised mostly of grey to brown and buff dolomite and local limestone, and is characterized by an abundance and diversity of stromatolites ( Acaciella australica  Stromatolite Assemblage). The Loves Creek Formation is marked by a pronounced negative &delta; 13 C isotope anomaly referred to as the Bitter Springs Anomaly (Klaebe et al., and references therein), although there is no isotopic data from Western Australia (WA). There are no direct age constraints for the formation from within the Amadeus Basin. Base on global age constraints for the Bitter Springs Anomaly, the formation is assigned an estimated age of 810-790 Ma. The Loves Creek Formation, while identified at spot locations where the  A. australica  Stromatolite Assemblage is identified, is not differentiated from Bitter Springs Group on geological maps in WA. This is because in WA the group is generally very poorly exposed, with recessive lithologies useful for distinguishing the formations of the group generally covered by sand and calcrete.    ","Widespread in the Amadeus Basin, although not differentiated from other units of the Bitter Springs Group on maps in Western Australia due to poor outcrop.  It's presence in the Western Australian Amadeus Basin is confirmed by the identification of the characteristic  Acaciella australica  Stromatolite Assemblage (Allen et al., 2012; Haines et al., 2012, 2014).","The Loves Creek Formation is named after Loves Creek in the northeastern Amadeus Basin in the Northern Territory (ALICE SPRINGS 1:250 000 scale map sheet). The term 'Loves Creek Member' of the 'Bitter Springs Formation' was first published by Wells et al. (1967), although no specific type section was nominated. As originally conceived, the 'Loves Creek Member' comprised a lower stromatolitic carbonate unit, and an upper unit of red-brown dolomitic siltstone interbedded with carbonate cycles. The upper unit was informally named the 'Johnny's Creek beds' by Gorter (1982), and later formalised as the 'Johnnys Creek Member' by Ambrose (2006), thus restricting the name 'Loves Creek Member' to the lower stromatolitic carbonate unit of the original member.  Normington et al. (2015) proposed revising the 'Bitter Springs Formation' to Bitter Springs Group, with the three former members promoted to formation status. This is now adopted basinwide. The type area of the Loves Creek Formation is a steep cliff-face with well-preserved stromatolite bioherms about 1.9 km north of Ross River Homestead, Northern Territory (MGA Zone 53 448534E 7392568N; ALICE SPRINGS 1:250 000 scale map sheet).     ",,"The Loves Creek Formation is composed mainly of dolomite and stromatolitic dolomite, locally varying to dolomitic limestone and stromatolitic dolomitic limestone. Silicification is common, and stromatolites may be partly replaced by chert. Chert also replaces nodules after sulphate evaporites. The carbonates are locally oolitic. Minor interbeds of siltstone are present. The formation is characterized by the abundance and diversity of stromatolites of the  Acaciella australica  Stromatolite Assemblage (Grey et al., 2012; Allen et al., 2012; Haines and Allen, 2014).",The Loves Creek Formation was deposited mainly under shallow marine inner shelf conditions.,,,,,,17,,,,4,,,,810,,790,,"The Loves Creek Formation has not been directly dated.

The global Bitter Springs Anomaly (negative &delta; 13 C isotope anomaly), which in the Amadeus Basin is encompassed by the Loves Creek Formation, is younger than 811.5 Â± 0.3 Ma, and older than 788.72 Â± 0.24 Ma, based on dating of older and younger ash beds in Canada and Ethiopia, respectively (Klaebe et al., 2017). Although there are some local palaeoenvironmental controls over the anomaly boundaries (Klaebe et al., 2017, if the general validity of the global chemostratigraphic correlations is assumed, the Loves Creek Formation can be approximately constrained to an age of 810-790 Ma.

In the west Kimberley region the Luman Siltstone marks the top of the Speewah Group where it is unconformably overlain by the King Leopold Sandstone (basal Kimberley Group). In the east Kimberley region the Luman Siltstone is conformably overlain by the Bedford Sandstone. The Luman Siltstone is a thin package of micaceous shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone.","The Luman Siltstone is relatively poorly exposed compared to the rest of the Speewah Group, in the same thin northeast- and northwest-trending corridor along the margins of the Kimberley Basin, adjacent to the western zone of the Lamboo Province. It is commonly preserved at the base of cliffs of King Leopold Sandstone in the west Kimberley region.","The Luman Siltstone is possibly named after the Luman Land District (Lat. -17&ordm; 19' 55'' S, Long. 128&ordm; 10' 4'' E) within the Kimberley Division of Western Australia on the DIXON RANGE 1:250 000 map sheet.

On the CHARNLEY 1:250 000 sheet the purple or grey siltstone contains cream-coloured siltstone nodules which grade into green fine-grained sandstone at the top of the formation; the quartz sandstones contain hematite (Gellatly et al., 1969). Ripple marks are ubiquitous in the Luman Siltstone on the LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 sheet (Griffin et al., 1993).","The Luman Siltstone was probably deposited in a low current energy depositional environment.

2908,35680,P_E-_lk-st,5076,Lungkarta Formation,1,"Quartz sandstone, commonly giant-scale cross-bedded; largely eolian","The Lungkarta Formation is a dominantly eolian sandstone comprising both dune and interdune facies, with lesser fluvial intervals (Haines et al., 2004, 2008; Grey et al., 2005). It is very similar in appearance to the outcropping McFadden Formation, particularly as exposed at Durba Hills where foreset heights exceed 60 m, and it is correlated with that formation on this basis and because of its similar stratigraphic position. Its age is unconstrained other than by stratigraphic position, between Elatina glaciation units below (Wahlgu Formation, Boondawari Formation beneath McFadden Formation) and the Cambrian Table Hill Volcanics above. However, the common reddish colour, taken with regional depositional patterns, suggest it may be Ediacaran in age. ","Seismic data indicate that the Lungkarta Formation is widespread in the western Officer Basin. Drillhole intersections are sparse but widespread (Grey et al., 2005; Haines et al., 2008): Vines 1 (124.5-300.7 m), Hussar 1 (159-?707 m), Kanpa 1A (658-829 m), Lancer 1 (205-344.3 m), and 90 RCHE 003 (134-150 m, TD).  The interval from 101 to 159 m in Hussar 1, placed in 'McFadden Formation equivalent' by Moors and Apak (2002), was regarded as Durba Sandstone by Grey et al. (2005). The lower boundary in Hussar 1 is tentatively placed at 707 m, rather than 560 m as suggested by Moors and Apak (2002), although it could also be placed at 647.5 m, as it bears greater similarity in described lithology and correlated thickness to the Lungkarta Formation in Lancer 1  than to the Wahlgu Formation (Grey et al, 2005), to which it was previously assigned. Perincek (1998) assigned the interval in Lungkarta 1 between the Table Hill Volcanics (base 704 m) and the Kanpa Formation (top 809 m) to the  McFadden Formation . Lithological descriptions of this interval are more suggestive of the Wahlgu Formation than the Lungkarta Formation (Grey et al., 2005).  The interval from 169 to 205 m in Lancer 1, initially placed in the Lungkarta Formation by Haines et al. (2004), is more reminiscent of the Durba Sandstone in outcrop.   Seismic reflectors indicate a lower and an upper member are recognizable in the Lennis area, with a composite thickness of up to 1200 m, separated by a relatively prominent seismic reflector ( intra-McFadden Formation equivalent  reflector of Apak and Moors, 2001). The lower member varies considerably in thickness, as a result of contemporaneous salt movement and salt walls, whereas the upper member shows more uniform depositional conditions, with some post-depositional erosion adjacent to salt walls (Apak and Moors, 2001). No wells intersect the unit in this area. There is reasonable seismic control for extending the upper member to areas with well control, but the lower member remains recognized only on seismic lines. Note that the  intra-McFadden Formation equivalent  reflector of Apak and Moors (2001) may instead mark an unconformity at the base of the Lungkarta Formation, and the lower member may correlate with sandstone intervals that overlie the cap dolomite in the upper Boondawari Formation in outcrop in the northwest Officer Basin (i.e. the lower interval is a high part of the Elatina glaciation deposits (Supersequence 3), rather than the earliest phase of Ediacaran deposition (Supersequence 4)).","The Lungkarta Formation (Haines et al., 2004, Grey et al., 2005) is a sandstone-dominated siliciclastic unit that rests on Wahlgu Formation and possibly Mason Conglomerate, and is locally overlain by Table Hill Volcanics. The formation is named after drillhole Lungkarta 1, although the interval initially assigned to the Lungkarta Formation is probably the underlying Wahlgu Formation (Grey et al., 2005). The type section is in Lancer 1, between 205 and 344.3 m, a thinner less complete section than Hussar 1 (159 - ?707 m), but fully cored.  The Lungkarta Formation is widely recognized on seismic sections and in some drillholes, but not unequivocally in outcrop. In Hussar 1, Lungkarta 1, and Kanpa 1A, the formation was initially referred to as the 'Babbagoola beds  (Townson, 1985; Phillips et al., 1985) or  Babbagoola Formation  (Cockbain and Hocking, 1989). Part of the  Babbagoola Formation , including the type section, is now known to be part of the Buldya Group (Grey and Cotter, 1996; Perincek, 1998), but the remainder of the unit originally referred to the Babbagoola Formation is apparently younger than this. Based mainly on its relative stratigraphic position, Perincek (1998) and Apak and Moors (2000, 2001) correlated this younger interval with outcrop of the McFadden Formation in the northwestern Officer Basin, but referred to it as'McFadden Formation equivalent' as continuity through outcrop could not be demonstrated.",,"The Lungkarta Formation contains sandstone, with lesser amounts of siltstone, mudstone, evaporite pseudomorphs, and minor gypsum. The type section consists of 139.3 m of sandstone, with minor interbedded conglomerate and mudstone. Several conglomerate beds are present near the base, and the interval between 214 and 344.3 m is dominated by sandstone with cross-bed sets at least 30, and possibly 40 m thick, inviting comparison with the giant cross-bedding seen at Durba and Diebil Hills in exposures of the McFadden Formation. The interval above 214 m is horizontally bedded and cross-bedded, but at far smaller scale (Haines et al., 2004). The reference section in Hussar 1 appears to be similar, in that it is described as sandstone with minor interbedded conglomerate and mudstone, but the sedimentary structures are unknown. In Vines 1, the section is again large-scale cross-bedded medium- to fine-grained sandstone of eolian origin.","The Lungkarta Formation was deposited in an eolian dune setting, with thin conglomerate layers recording interdune deposition, and siltstone layers preserving thin playa deposits. Thin fluvial intercalations are present near the base of the unit.",16,1200,,"The Lungkarta Formation unconformably overlies the Wahlgu Formation in Hussar 1 and Lancer 1, and the Steptoe Formation in Kanpa 1A. In Lancer 1 and Vines 1, the only cored intersections, the break is erosional and disconformable rather than angularly unconformable (Haines et al., 2004, 2008).   The Lungkarta Formation is overlain by probable Durba Sandstone in Lancer 1 and Hussar 1, with a hiatus of unknown duration.

The correlative McFadden Formation is commonly assumed to be synorogenic with the Paterson Orogeny (Williams 1992), implying an age of 600 - 550 Ma, but this assumption arose before its eolian setting was recognised.

94,10869,A-KGlu-bb,4730,Lunnon Basalt,1,Basalt; massive to pillowed; tholeiitic in composition; metamorphosed,"The Lunnon Basalt is characterized by dark grey-green, fine-grained, massive to pillowed lava flows with a tholeiitic signature. The rocks are distributed across the western half of the LAKE LEFROY map sheet around the Kambalda Dome, westwards across the YILMA map sheet and the Widgiemooltha Dome. Interflow sedimentary units are rare, but are most common in the middle of the unit. The maximum interpreted thickness is approximately 1750m, however the base of the unit has not been identified and structural thickening cannot be excluded. The Kambalda Komatiite overlies the Lunnon Basalt at a concordant contact, but thin (<2m) fine-grained metasiltstones and metaclaystones are also known to be at the contact. Geochemically the lower half of the Lunnon Basalt is more magnesium rich (average 8.3 wt % MgO) compared to the slightly more evolved upper half (average 7.8 wt % MgO). Chondrite-normalized rare earth element patterns show a flat to slight light rare earth element depletion.","The Lunnon basalt is an extensive unit that occurs in three parallel greenstone belts over tens of kilometres. These belts extend from Kambalda southwards to Tramways (LAKE LEFROY); Mt Herbert southwards to Bluebush (LAKE LEFORY) and the westernmost belt is centred around the Widgiemooltha Dome (COWAN) and north-westwards to greenstones west of Horse Rocks (YILMIA). The true thickness of the basalt is unknown, however the minimum inferred thickness is 1750m (Squire et al, 1998). In some cases the thickness of the unit may be caused by thrust stacking and structural repetition due to isoclinal folding.   Regionally, units that have been interpreted as lateral equivalents of the Lunnon Basalt include: Wongi and Missouri Basalts (e.g. Wyche &amp; Witt 1994; Swager et al., 1995), Scotia Basalt (Christie, 1975), Mount Edwards Basalt (Muccilli, 2006) and part of the Woolyeenyer Formation at Norseman (Said &amp; Kerrich, 2009; Squire et al., 2010). ","The name &ldquo;Lunnon Basalt&rdquo; was first used by Roberts (1988). The derivation of the name is uncertain, but there are prominent outcrops located at the Lunnon nickel mine (Zone 51J, MGA 374318E, 6545943N) at Kambalda. Alternatively, there is oral history that major mineralized shoots were named after the driller who first encountered the shhots. Locally there is the Lunnon Shoot, from which the Lunnon Basalt may be so named.  Alternative names in the literature for the unit include  Lower Basalt  (e.g. Swager et al., 1990; Morris, 1993; Said et al., 2010), the  Kambalda Lower Footwall  (Gresham and Loftus-Hills, 1981), or  Unit IA  by Keats (1987).  ",,"The basalt is typically non-vesicular and aphyric. Some thicker units may show gradation from aphyric margins to medium-, or coarser-grained doleritic to rare gabbroic central parts. Fresh surfaces are dark green-grey which changes to a black or dark red-black weathered veneer. Interflow sedimentary units are rare, but where found are often in the middle of the unit. Gresham and Loftus-Hill (1981) and Redman and Keays (1985) subdivided the Lunnon Basalt into the  lower  and upper  members, separated by an interflow sedimentary horizon. The lower member being slightly more magnesium rich (average 8.3 wt % MgO) compared to the slightly more evolved upper member (average 7.8 wt % MgO). Different elemental ratios suggest the more fractionated upper part involves the loss of clinopyroxene rather than olivine (Morris, 1990).   Features identifiable in the field include: &bull; Pillowed basalts, with individual pillow sizes generally less than 120 cm and averaging between 20-60 cm &bull; Massive flow sheets &bull; Flows rarely exceed 10m thickness and are mostly less than 5m in thickness (Morris, 1993), but have been recorded up to 30 m thick (Lesher &amp; Arndt, 1995) &bull; Flow top breccias with jig-saw fit textures indicating subaqueous emplacement &bull; Rare vesicles and amygdales, filled with carbonate, quartz and feldspar. Several authors have indicated that vesicles are absent in the upper member (after Redman and Keays, 1985) of the Lunnon Basalt in the Kambalda Dome region (e.g. Gresham, 1986; Squire et al., 1998). &bull; Pyroxene spinifex-texture is rare but found in some basal sections &bull; Metamorphic amphiboles have a fibrous habit with a plumose texture &bull; Varioles are rare.   Geochemical characteristics include: &bull; Tholeiitic &bull; Average anhydrous SiO2 of 51.8 wt %, Range from 45 to 56 w t% &bull; Average anhydrous Al2O3 of 15.3 wt %, Range from 11.5 to 17.5 wt % &bull; Average anhydrous MgO of 7.3 wt %, general range from 5.5 to 8 wt % (Barnes et al., 2012), but there are variations due to some units being more &ldquo;andesitic&rdquo;. &bull; Average Mg no.# is approximately 53-54 &bull; Minor LREE depletion, average primitive mantle normalised (La/Sm)n value of 0.90 &bull; &epsilon;Nd values are > 0, e.g. +2.1 and +3.7 (Lesher and Arndt, 1995) &bull; Ni ppm are typically 140-160 (Lesher and Arndt, 1995), 91-134 (Squire et al. 2010), 53-163 (Hope 2004) &bull; Average Cr value of ~405ppm, range from 121 to 1704 ppm   The mineral assemblage is dominated by actinolite after pyroxene and subordinate plagioclase accompanied by quartz, epidote, chlorite and carbonate. At amphibolite facies grade the basalt assemblage is dominated by hornblende, plagioclase and biotite. Locally, in the more magnesium-rich layers tremolite has an acicular to fibrous habit. Claou&eacute;-Long (1986) records pseudomorphs of small olivine replaced by serpentinite minerals in the lower more magnesium-rich lower member. Gresham and Loftus-Hills (1981) mention almandine as a rare component which may also be seen in the interstitial space between pillows.    Pillowed basalt is a common feature of the Lunnon Basalt forming approximately 45 percent of the unit (Squire et al., 1998). Despite multiple deformation events and greenschist to lower-amphibolite facies metamorphism ellipsoidal and re-entrant pillow forms are common and allow determination of younging direction. Pillows are generally tightly packed with very little or no interstitial hyaloclastite. Where pillow interstices have formed secondary quartz and carbonate, and less commonly fragmental elongate angular basalt fragments are found. Internal pillow textures include rare elongate radial vesicles infilled with quartz and carbonate and subparallel intrapillow cavities in the upper third of the pillow tube. These cavities are commonly in filled with carbonate and quartz and often have a flat floor (near parallel to S 0 ) and an arched top. Generally, these cavities are single entities within a pillow, but some pillows have been found to have stacked cavities.   Morris (1993) reviewed adjacent drill holes from the southern Kalgoorlie terrane to determine lateral continuity of facies within the Lunnon Basalt. He observed major facies changes at the scale of 5-10 m in the Kambalda region, but in the Coolgardie area lateral continuity was greater.   At Kambalda, a unit of the Lunnon Basalt adjacent to the Foster Thrust as two layer parallel units that are locally referred to as the Lunnon Dolerite (Zone 51J, MGA, 381800E, 6532000N). These zones are not separate intrusions but are a coarser-grained gabbroic-like textural variation with large pyroxene crystals (pers. comm. Rick Squire 2010).   Geochemical studies on the Lunnon Basalt have been undertaken by Morris (1993), and more recently by Barely et al. (2002), Said et al. (2010) and Barnes et al. (2012). Lunnon Basalt samples from the Kambalda area by Morris (1993) showed a flat to slightly LREE-depleted chondrite-normalised pattern, and &epsilon;Nd ranging from +2 to +4.    ","Arndt et al., (2008) suggested the Lunnon Basalt extruded onto a submarine mafic plain on pre-exisitng continental crust. Squire et al., (1998) interpreted the environment of deposition as a ponded, tectonically-topographically controlled (possibly rift-related) distal sea floor succession. The lack of proximal facies associated with a synvolcanic feeder system suggests deposition well away from the point of eruption (Squire et al., 1998).   Paleoflow indicators within the Lunnon Basalt, such as pillow shape and budding directions on pillows from the Otter-Juan site, near Kambalda, indicate lava flowed from west to northwest. Squire et al., 1998 suggest that the paleoflow directions were between southwest to north-northwest around Kambalda.",,1750,,"Overlying the Lunnon Basalt is the Kambalda Komatiite. Where komatiite flows with a thickness of 25-100 metres have been mapped, the contact with the underlying Lunnon Basalt is concordant. Elsewhere a fine-grained sedimentary horizon separates the Lunnon from the komatiite. The thin (1-2 m thick) sedimentary layers are found regionally and indicate that there was very little regional relief to the top of the Lunnon Basalt (Squire et al., 1998). The base of the Lunnon Basalt has not been observed.",,17,,,,4,,,,2726,,2704,,"The age of the Lunnon Basalt is poorly constrained and has not been directly dated. Ages which have been published and constrain the age of the Lunnon Basalt are from sedimentary units and there is some controversy on the validity of the ages (e.g. Brown et al., 2001). Relative, but broad constraints on the age of the Lunnon Basalt can be applied from units stratigraphically above and below the basalt.   A minimum age is constrained by a published age of the Kapai Slate. The slate is a metasedimentary unit above the Kambalda Komatiite and Devon Consols Basalt which overlie the Lunnon Basalt. The age is given as 2692 Â± 4 Ma and is considered to be a magmatic age reflecting contemporaneous felsic volcanism during sedimentation of the mudstone (Claou&eacute;-Long et al., 1988).    Alternatively, there are a number of ages cited in unpublished company reports, or in published data but where there is question on the source, that may provide a minimum age constraint are from the overlying Komatiitic units. These include:  1. An internal report for Western Mining Corporation by W. Stone (1997) reports on high precision zircon geochronology results done by with J. Claou&eacute;-Long. A mean U-Pb SHRIMP age of 2709 Â± 4 Ma is reported for zircons with &ldquo;igneous interiors&rdquo; extracted from an interflow sedimentary unit at the top of the lowermost komatiite flow in the Kambalda Komatiite near the Kambalda Dome. 2. 2709 Â± 4 Ma (SHRIMP, zircon) for the age of an intercalated sedimentary unit at the base of the Kambalda Komatiite and referenced to Claou&eacute;-Long et al. (1988). However the age is not cited in that paper (e.g. Neumayr et al., 2004). 3. 2702 Â± 4 Ma (SHRIMP, zircon). Mentioned in Squire et al. (1998), as an age on a sedimentary horizon above the second lowermost komatiite flow, overlying the Lunnon Basalt. Again attributed to Claou&eacute;-Long et al., 1988, but not cited in the paper. 4. Foster et al. (1996) used mineralized and unmineralized samples of the Kambalda Komatiite from Kambalda, and laterally equivalent ultramafic units from the Perseverance and Mt Keith deposits to define a Re-Os isochron age of 2706 Â± 36 Ma. 5. A sedimentary unit at the base of an ultramafic in the Cameron Deposit, at Bluebush area (ultramafic-mafic belt 50km SSE of Kambalda) yielded a SHRIMP zircon age of 2714 Â± 4 Ma. (written comm. Jon Claou&eacute;-Long to P. Morris (GSWA), 2009). The ultramafic is potentially a lateral equivalent of the Kambalda Komatiite.  6. A sedimentary unit at the base of an ultramafic at Widgiemooltha yielded a SHRIMP zircon age of 2717 Â± 4 Ma. (written comm. Jon Claou&eacute;-Long to P. Morris (GSWA), 2009). Again, the ultramafic is potentially a lateral equivalent of the Kambalda Komatiite.  If the sediments at the base of these komatiites units date the start of the ultramafic volcanism then it places a minimum age on the Lunnon Basalt at c. 2717 Ma.   Wider extrapolations on an age constraint for the Lunnon Basalt include: 1. The Lindsays Basalt (Coolgardie Subgroup) is interpreted to be a lateral equivalent of the Lunnon Basalt. The McPhersons Tonalite has intruded the Lindsays Basalt, and has a U-Pb zircon magmatic crystallisation age of 2699 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 182299), indicating that the Lindsay Basalt must be older than c. 2699 Ma. 2. In the Norsemen Terrane, the lower part Woolyeenyer Formation is interpreted to be a lateral equivalent of the Lunnon Basalt (Said et al., 2010; Squire et al., 2010). This unit includes mafic sills, and a differentiated portion of a cross-cutting sill (Crown Main Dyke) that yielded an age of 2714 Â± 5 Ma (Hill et al., 1992). Hill et al. (1992) interpreted this sill as a feeder to the basalts and therefore indicate Woolyeenyer Formation mafic volcanism started before c. 2714 Ma. A minimum age constraint for the Woolyeenyer Formation at c. 2691 (Campbell and Hill, 1988) is the magmatic age of a biotite granite, intrudes metasedimentary rocks stratigraphically above the Woolyeenyer Formation.

2905,10871,P_-_lu-se,1,Lupton Formation,1,Diamictite and sandstone,"The Lupton Formation is a poorly exposed enigmatic unit of diamictite and sandstone that rests on the Townsend Quatzite and Lefroy Formation in the southern Officer Basin adjacent to the Musgrave Province. Its age is constrained only by the Lefory Formation below and the Table Hill Volcanics above, but from regional relationships it is most likely (though not demonstrated unequivaocally) that it was probably deposited during the Sturtian glacial period, and that it may correlate with the Pirrilyungka Formation from Vines 1.","The narrative below is largely extracted from Grey et al. (2005).  The Lupton Formation is part of a southwesterly dipping succession exposed along the southern margin of the Musgrave Province on TALBOT and COOPER 1:250 000 sheets. The succession is very poorly exposed, and was originally measured at only two field sections. Several areas mapped as Paterson Formation may however be Lupton Formation, based solely on outcrop pattern and proximity ot the Townsend Quartzite and Musgrave Province.  Re-examination of the type locality suggests the type section is 69 m thick (not 240 m as originally indicated by Jackson and van de Graaff, 1981), but neither the stratigraphic base nor top is exposed. At Ainslie Gorge, 140 km to the west, the formation is 250 m thick and quite different lithologically. The diamictite is about 15 m thick at outcrops in the Lupton Hills (Grey et al., 1999), whereas all 250 m exposed at Ainslie Gorge is diamictite (Jackson and van de Graaff, 1981, fig. 13). This raises the possibility that the only true Lupton Formation is in the type area, and that the Ainslie Gorge succession is a different unit of unknown relationships (Grey et al., 2005).  The Lupton Formation may be a lateral equivalent of the Pirrilyungka Formation in Vines 1 (see Derivation of Name).","The  Lupton Beds  were named by Lowry et al. (1972), after the Lupton Hills, and defined by Jackson and van de Graaff (1981). Cockbain and Hocking (1989) amended the name to Lupton Formation. The type section of the Lupton Formation is at Lupton Hills (MGA Zone 52, 404800E 7063970N) on central COOPER 1:250 000 sheet. Jackson and van de Graaff (1981) described the type section as being 240 m thick, but failed to note a synclinal axis in the outcrop, which reduces the exposed thickness to 69 m (Grey et al., 1999; 2005). The section through the Lupton Formation south of Ainslie Gorge (immediately south of the type section of the Lefroy Formation) illustrated by Jackson and van de Graaff (1981, fig. 13) is a reference section (Grey et al., 2005), with the modification that the lower contact, with the Lefroy Formation, is at 600 m and is probably unconformable.  The Neoproterozoic diamictite succession in Empress 1A was tentatively assigned to the Lupton Formation by Stevens and Apak (1999), but was assigned to the Wahlgu Formation by Grey et al. (2005) because of uncertainties of correlation between the Empress 1A section and the outcropping Lupton Formation. The section in Empress 1A is reasonably well constrained to the Elatina glacial episode (c. 600 Ma; Grey et al., 1999; Walter and Hill, 1999). The age of the Lupton Formation in outcrop is constrained by the underlying Townsend Quartzite and Lefroy Formation, and the regionally overlying Phanerozoic Table Hill Volcanics. However, the presence of a thick interval attributable to the Sturtian glaciation in Vines 1 (Pirrilyungka Formation; Haines et al., 2008) nearby to outcrop suggests the Lupton Formation may be a product of the Sturtian glaciation. Several areas mapped as Phanerozoic Paterson Formation adjacent to Townsend Quartzite outcrops (southwest of the Hocking Range, and between Townsend Ridges and the Brown Range) may also be Lupton Formation, based on apparent trends in outcrop.",,"The Lupton Formation contains diamictite, cross-bedded sandstone, and minor siltstone (Jackson and van de Graaff, 1981). Early authors referred to the formation as a  tillite , but evidence of glacial influence is limited to rare facetted and striated clasts, and the very poor sorting, so the rock type is better described as a diamictite (Grey et al., 1999). The type locality at Lupton Hills consists of a lower unit of massive, very poorly sorted pebble to boulder conglomerate, overlain by an upper unit of interbedded conglomerate, sandstone, and siltstone. Outcrops elsewhere are mostly fine-grained diamictite with scattered large boulders, and interbedded fine-grained, well-bedded sandstone and coarse-grained, cross-bedded sandstone (Jackson and van de Graaff, 1981).  The basal part of the Lupton Formation in the Ainslie Gorge area is very different from the succession at Lupton Hills. It consists of an apparent gradation from the laminated siltstone of the Lefroy Formation to indistinctly bedded siltstone with isolated cobbles and boulders up to 0.4 m in diameter. The siltstone is overlain by a thick succession of mostly fine-grained diamictite with scattered larger boulders.  Southeast of Ainslie Gorge there is a folded succession of diamictite, fine-grained, well-bedded sandstone, and coarse-grained, cross-bedded sandstone that contains isolated boulders of granite and quartzite up to 0.9 m in diameter.","The Lupton Formation is probably glacigene, at least in part. However, it could simply be an alluvial fan to fluvial deposit related to uplift of the nearby Musgrave Province (Grey et al., 2005).",15,250,,"The lower contact is not generally exposed. Although it appears transitional in the Ainslie Gorge area, the juxtaposition of the Lefroy Formation with a glacigene unit, when glacigene rocks are not recorded elsewhere in the Officer or Amadeus Basins in the Buldya Group other than possibly at the base of the Pirrilyungka Formation in Vines 1 (Haines et al., 2008), indicates an unconformable relationship with a significant age difference. Elsewhere clasts of Townsend Quartzite, oolitic chert, and other rocks suggest that the contact is unconformable. The upper contact is not seen.",,17,,,,4,,,,720,,635,,"There is no internal evidence for the age of the Lupton Formation. It is uncertain whether the Lupton Formation in the type area and at Ainslie Gorge is related to the Sturtian or Elatina glaciation, or to neither. The presence of the Pirrilyungka Formation in central COOPER 1:250 000 sheet favours a correlation with Sturtian glacial rocks.  Grey et al. (2005) raised the possibility that the Lupton Formation might be Ediacaran, based on a canyon-cutting event in the eastern Officer Basin. A large canyon infilled by rocks mapped as glacigene Patterson Formation (Jackson and van de Graaff, 1981) is incised through the Lefroy Formation and Townsend Quartzite into the Mesoproterozoic Mission Group of the Musgrave Province near Ainslie Gorge on TALBOT 1:250 000 sheet. The interpreted strike-length of this feature is about 15 km, with Ainslie Gorge located at its northwestern edge. If the canyon correlates with the canyon-cutting event in the eastern Officer Basin (Morton and Drexel, 1997), and if the infill is Lupton Formation, then the Lupton Formation may correlate with the Narana Formation (Supersequence 4) in the eastern Officer Basin. Alternatively, the cutting and infill could be Carboniferous - Permian, related to the Permian Paterson Formation.

Together with the Mummawarrawarra Basalt they form the Kunmarnara Group, interpreted as the early volcano-sedimentary succession of the intracontinental Ngaanyatjarra Rift. Deposition of the MacDougall Formation is interpreted to have taken place between c. 1085 and 1075 Ma.","The MacDougall Formation forms thin, sporadic, east-trending outcrops immediately east of the Cavenagh Range on the western side of BLACKSTONE, and a similarly thin sporadic belt of outcrops along the southwestern base of MacDougall Bluff on the eastern side of BLACKSTONE. It is perhaps best exposed in the Mount Blyth area in the central parts of COOPER.  Muscovite-bearing quartzite (P_-KRd-mxsm), also thought to form part of the MacDougall Formation, outcrops sporadically along the northern edge of the Blackstone and Finlay Ranges, where it is interpreted to reflect a bedrock unit, forming a continuous, 1-2 km wide, west- to west-northwesterly trending belt that parallels the northern edge of these ranges. This quartzite unit is best exposed in the northwest of HOLT, 5-10 km south of Mount Muir, where it forms northwest-trending ridges, up to 200 m wide and 5 km long that trace the northeast limb of a large, west-northwesterly trending fold.  Outcrops within the large low-magnetic area at the junction between BENTLEY, DIORITE, GOLDEN POINT, and TABLE POINT are largely dominated by quartzofeldspathic rocks and interlayered quartzite and muscovite(-garnet-kyanite) schists assigned to the MacDougall Formation. This metamorphosed and strongly deformed component of the MacDougall Formation is best exposed in the northwest corner of BENTLEY, 5 km east of Mitika Homestead, where the quartzite-dominated beds are exposed as north-trending ridges that form the limbs of regional tight to isoclinal west-verging, overturned folds.","The name of this unit was derived by Daniels (1974) from MacDougall Bluff, 11 km north of Skirmish Hill.",,"The MacDougall Formation consists of interbedded, coarse-grained, arkosic sandstone, pebbly arkose, pebble beds, and matrix-supported conglomerate. Isoclinally folded muscovite-bearing quartzite and muscovite schist represent strongly deformed equivalents to this unit (P_-KRd-mxsm, P_-KRd-mhs, P_-KRd-mhe). In the undeformed units, most pebbles are well rounded, 2 to 3 cm in size, and consist of vein quartz. In strongly deformed portions the vein quartz pebbles reach 10 cm in length, displaying well-defined stretching lineations. On BLACKSTONE, the unit has a maximum thickness of ~500 m and dips at a shallow to moderate angle (typically ~30&ordm;) to the north or northeast. It unconformably overlies porphyritic granite, and is conformably overlain by lavas of the Mummawarrawarra Basalt. The sandstones locally show well-developed cross-bedding, and, according to Daniels (1974), preserve paleocurrent indicators, suggesting the depositional system flowed away from the area between MacDougall Bluff (southeast BLACKSTONE) and Mount Blyth (COOPER). In the northwest corner of BENTLEY, the metamorphic grade ranges from greenschist to upper amphibolite facies through a series of shallow east dipping thrusts and the rocks contain metamorphic minerals such as garnet, staurolite, and kyanite. In the Wannarn area, on DIORITE, the metamorphic grade reaches granulite facies and rocks of the MacDougall Formation have a granoblastic texture and are in mylonitic contact with slivers of older basement rock of the Musgrave Province.  A sample taken from an outcrop east of the Cavenagh Range (BLACKSTONE, WAROX site RHSMUG001189, GSWA 185597) is typical of this formation, and includes two domains: coarse-grained sandstone and pebble conglomerate. The sandstone is very poorly sorted, comprising subrounded to angular clasts up to 5 mm in size, mainly of quartz, but also containing feldspar and quartz-feldspar rock fragments. The matrix consists of muscovite-sericite, is locally epidote-rich, and most likely reflects the low- to medium-grade contact metamorphism of an initially clay-rich or feldspathic matrix. The conglomerate domain is clast-supported (just), and comprises subrounded to subangular pebbles of quartz and (rarely) cherty siltstone within a matrix of muscovite (sericite) and epidote. ","The association of coarse-grained fluvial sedimentary rocks (MacDougall Formation) and basaltic andesites, and andesites with a high-K intraplate geochemistry (Mummawarrawarra Basalt) observed in the Kunmarnara Group suggests deposition in an intracontinental rift-type setting.",,,,"The MacDougall Formation (P_-KRd-sg) nonconformably overlies older basement gneiss of the Musgrave Province. Contacts with the overlying Mummawarrawarra Basalt are conformable, and peperitic contacts observed at Mount Blyth (COOPER) indicate that the sandstones and conglomerates were unconsolidated at the time of basaltic eruption.  In the Mitika and Wanarn areas, the MacDougall Formation is interpreted to lie uncomformably over Mesoproterozoic rocks of the Musgrave Province. However, this contact is rarely well exposed. In contrast, mylonitic contacts between paragneisses of the MacDougall Formation (P_-KRd-mtn) and orthogneisses of the c. 1600 Ma Warlawurru Supersuite (P_-WR-mg) are well exposed 7 kilometres southwest of Wanarn. This is interpreted as a tectonic sliver of Musgrave Province basement, emplaced into the MacDougall Formation during the 580-520 Ma Petermann Orogeny.",,17,,,,4,,,,1085,,1075,,"A total of nine samples from the MacDougall Formation were collected throughout the west Musgrave Region to investigate the detrital zircon age spectra of this formation (Evins et al., 2010; GSWA 194420, Kirkland et al., 2010a; GSWA 194422, Kirkland et al., 2010b; GSWA 190292, Kirkland et al., 2011a; GSWA 201311, Kirkland et al., 2014a; GSWA 194806, Kirkland et al., 2014b; GSWA 205194, Kirkland et al., 2014c; GSWA 208414, Kirkland et al., 2014d; GSWA 185414, Kirkland et al., 2014e; GSWA 201307, Kirkland et al., 2014f; Quentin de Gromard et al., 2016). The nine samples show a dominant Musgrave Orogeny peak at c. 1179 Ma and other significant age components at c. 1611, 1566, 1505, 1428, and 1405 Ma (Quentin de Gromard et al., 2016). Interestingly, all samples of the MacDougall Formation lack detrital zircons of the voluminous Wankanki Supersuite of the 1345-1293 Ma Mount West Orogeny.  The maximum depositional age of the MacDougall Formation is constrained by the youngest detrital zircon age component of c. 1179 Ma. A more realistic maximum age is the c. 1085 Ma regional maximum age of magmatism associated with the Giles Event (Edgoose et al., 2004; Evins et al., 2010), which must be nearly coeval with the onset of the Ngaanyatjarra Rift and the deposition of the Kunmarnara Group.  A sample obtained from layered mafic intrusive rocks of the Giles Suite, emplaced within the Mummawarrawarra Basalt yielded a magmatic crystallization age of 1076 Â± 7 Ma (GSWA 194762, Kirkland et al., 2011c). Sun et al. (1996) obtained an age of 1078 Â± 3 Ma from a granitic layer within the layered BELL ROCK intrusion. Hence, an age range of 1078-1075 Ma can be inferred for these layered intrusions, which can also be interpreted as a minimum depositional age for the MacDougall Formation (Smithies et al., 2009).  A c. 630 Ma metamorphic zircon rim growth event is reported in the northwest corner of BENTLEY (GSWA 205194, Kirkland et al., 2014c; GSWA 208414, Kirkland et al., 2014d). It is coeval with the muscovite crystallization age in quartzite of the MacDougall Formation (GSWA 185414, Kirkland et al., 2013) and with the zircon crystallization age in pegmatites elsewhere in the Musgrave Province (GSWA 187175, Kirkland et al., 2011b).",No,,,3,,No,Submitted,No,Yes,P_,KRd,,,,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

It was deposited in a proximal ramp setting that passed into a deep-marine environment to the southwest between c. 2627 and 2598 Ma.","The MacLeod Member is present throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region, where it is exposed on the 1:250 000 map sheets YARRALOOLA, PYRAMID, WYLOO, MOUNT BRUCE, ROY HILL, BALFOUR DOWNS, TUREE CREEK, NEWMAN, and ROBERTSON and forms a poorly exposed unit in the middle of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation. The member is typically about 30-40 m thick, but is variable with a much reduced section recorded in the Chichester Range where a change to carbonate facies banded iron-formation (BIF) makes identification of the constituent members of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation contentious (Lascelles 2000; Hurst et al., 2013).","The MacLeod Member was formally named by Blockley et al. (1993) after Mount MacLeod (Zone 50, MGA 604807E 7523103N), about 28 km northwest of Marandoo camp in the Karijini National Park. The type section is defined as the interval between 419.65 and 465.80 m in DDH 275. Because of its susceptibility to erosion, complete natural exposures are rare, but it is well exposed on Kungarra Gorge on the northern limb of the eastward extension of the Mount Wall Anticline (Zone 50, MGA 494411E 7478870N), in the Turner Syncline (Zone 50, MGA 544596E 7492540N), and in two gorges in the Wanna Munna Anticline (Zone 50, MGA 720749E 7445814N and Zone 50, MGA 719102E 7445727N) (Blockley et al., 1993).   In addition to the formal lithostratigraphy, an informal numbering of the black stilpnomelane-rich shale bands, combined with four marker beds of chert pods is used by the mining companies for mapping and regional correlation. The shale bands are very distinctive in natural gamma-ray logs and they are numbered MS1 to MS13. The marker beds are known as the  football chert ,  stilpnomelane bed ,  Youngman pods , and the  Sullivan pods  (also referred to as the  Duncan pods ). The Vivash Riebeckite Zone locally extends down to about the level of MS10.",,"In fresh drill core, the MacLeod Member consists of interbedded iron formation, black shale, chert, and carbonate. The iron formations consist of chert, iron carbonates, and iron silicates with variable proportions of magnetite. The black shales are commonly stilpnomelane-rich and characterized by distinct natural gamma-ray peaks, but are difficult to identify in outcrop. Chert beds are commonly podded and some form distinctive marker horizons. Carbonates consist mainly of bedded dolomitic turbidites. The MacLeod Member is commonly weathered in outcrop, poorly exposed, and forms prominent strike gullies. In the Chichester Range, the member is thinner and dominated by carbonate facies (Hurst et al., 2013).   The presence of characteristic chert nodule beds in the MacLeod Member has been widely used in mapping (Kepert, 2018), but positive identification of specific horizons can be difficult without also identifying the associated, but poorly exposed shale bands. The basal  football chert  is located between shale bands MS1 and MS4 and consists of 4-6 m of distinctive large, ovoid chert pods, commonly with quartz-filled septarian fractures. The pods are less susceptible to weathering than the matrix, resulting in a lag of residual chert pods on highly weathered surfaces. The  stilpnomelane bed  is present between MS4 and MS5 and is a 10 m-thick tuffaceous, dark-green to black, stilpnomelane-rich unit that weathers red in outcrop. The  Youngman pods  and  Sullivan pods  are two thin intervals of cherty limonitic pods that are present immediately below MS6 and MS9, respectively. The  Sullivan pods  have also been referred to as the  Duncan pods .","There are lateral facies changes within the MacLeod Member from carbonate- to silicate-rich between the Chichester and Hamersley Ranges. These, combined with the presence of carbonate turbidites in the Hamersley Ranges, are indicative of deposition in a proximal ramp setting (Hurst et al., 2013), passing into a deep-marine environment towards the southwest (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003; Pickard et al., 2004).",,40,,"The MacLeod Member conformably overlies the Nammuldi Member and, in turn, is conformably overlain by the Mount Newman Member. The basal contact is marked by a change from cherty BIF to shale at the base of MS1. The upper contact is identified by the base of BIF overlying the MS13 shale band.   There is some confusion surrounding the assignment of the  potato bed , which has been included in the MacLeod Member by some authors and is used to define its base (Kepert, 2018). This assignment is useful for mapping purposes because it keeps all podded marker units in the middle Marra Mamba Iron Formation in the MacLeod Member. However, it does not conform to the formal definition of the member of Blockley et al. (1993). Based on the location of the  potato bed  with respect to marker shale bands, it would appear that Blockley et al. (1993) may have mistaken the  potato bed  for the  football chert . Correct identification of the various chert pod horizons is a common problem, and Blockley et al. (1993) advise against use of the  potato bed  to define the base of the MacLeod Member.",,17,,,,5,,,,2627,,2598,,"There are no depositional ages determined directly from the MacLeod Member, but it is younger than a 2629 Â± 5 Ma tuff bed at the top of the underlying Jeerinah Formation (Trendall et al., 2004), and older than a 2597 Â± 5 Ma tuff bed in the Mount Newman Member of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation (Trendall et al., 1998).

An equigranular groundmass is dominated by plagioclase and biotite with minor quartz. Dark mafic irregular inclusions, with diffuse boundaries up to 5cm in size are throughout the body. The inclusions comprise equal ratios of fine biotite and quartz.   Petrographical analysis indicates the mineral assemblage of 60-80% plagioclase with fine sericite throughout most grains. Quartz (15-25%) varies from having weak undulose extinction to subgrain domains. Mafic minerals include straw-yellow to brown biotite (5-7%) and green hornblende (1-3%). Rare minerals are zircon, titanate, epidote, apatite, opaques and carbonate. A single geochemical analysis (GSWA 182299) suggests the rock straddles the tonalite/granodiorite fields.

1503,26006,A-_mh-xbb-s,1,Maggie Hays Formation,1,Basalt and siliciclastic sedimentary rocks; metamorphosed,"The Maggie Hays Formation is the lowermost, formally described, unit in the Lake Johnston greenstone belt (southeastern part of the Youanmi Terrane, Yilgarn Craton). It has been mapped on ROUNDTOP, JOHNSTON, BRONZITE RIDGE and TAY. The original thickness of the formation is difficult to estimate due to shearing and possible structural repetition. Nevertheless, it has been estimated at about 2400 m by Gower and Bunting (1976).  The Maggie Hays Formation is a commonly deformed and metamorphosed, tholeiitic submarine volcanic succession, with thin sedimentary interlayers. The sporadic outcrop and variation in intensity and complexity of deformation make it difficult to define the overall younging direction. However, weakly deformed pillow structures in the western part of the greenstone belt consistently indicate younging to the west. ","The Maggie Hays Formation forms part of the Lake Johnston greenstone belt stratigraphy. The main exposure is on JOHNSTON, with minor exposures on ROUNDTOP, TAY and BRONZITE RIDGE. The best exposure of the formation is along the western shoreline of Lake Johnston, east of Maggie Hays Hill on JOHNSTON (Zone 51, MGA 292185E 6385261N), which is proposed as the type section.   Hills on the western shoreline of Lake Johnston are formed by rocks of the Maggie Hays Formation. Other major outcrop areas are at Mount Day (Zone 51, MGA 263750E 6441555N), about eight kilometres north of the Norseman-Hyden Road, and at Mount Gordon (Zone 51, MGA 268265E 6404640N) in the southernmost part of JOHNSTON, east of Lake Hope.  Gower and Bunting (1976) proposed a thickness of about 2400 m for the Maggie Hays Formation but this estimate is very approximate due to extensive deformation and metamorphism of the formation. ","The Maggie Hays Formation (Gower and Bunting, 1976) is named after Maggie Hays Hill (Zone 51, MGA 272514E 6425450N) on JOHNSTON. The best exposure of the formation is along the western shoreline of Lake Johnston, east of Maggie Hays Hill on JOHNSTON (Zone 51, MGA 292185E 6385261N), which is proposed as the type section.  The lowest exposed part of the Maggie Hays Formation in the type section is at its easternmost point (SSRJHS0000242, Zone 51 MGA 273930E 6425773N), close to where it has been intruded by a monzogranite that has been dated at 2696 Â± 14 Ma (Mole, 2012; Mole et al., 2015). The western end of the type section is formed by amphibolite after pillowed basalt (SSRJHS0001332, Zone 51, MGA 273873E 6425067N). The section follows the western shoreline of Lake Johnston for about 1000 m and represents a 527 m section across strike. Intervals include amphibolite after variably deformed pillowed basalts, amphibolite after feldspar-phyric basalt, meta-hyaloclastite (SSRJHS000228, Zone 51, MGA 273857E 6425175N), fine- to medium-grained amphibolite after basalt, minor para-amphibolites with aligned amphiboles and fine-grained mafic sedimentary rocks. Fine- to medium-grained amphibolite after dolerite crosscuts the succession. ",,"Away from the type section, the lowest exposed rocks in the Maggie Hays Formation are amphibolites (after tholeiitic basalt) with preserved pillow structures containing amygdales. Fine-grained, massive amphibolite containing variously deformed and recrystallized feldspar porphyroclasts (relict phenocrysts) is commonly associated with the metamorphosed pillowed basalts. Above the plagioclase-phyric amphibolite, a package of fine-grained amphibolite is overlain by finely layered, medium-grained amphibolite. This amphibolite is intercalated with pelite and minor thin layers of metamorphosed volcaniclastic rocks.   A prominent layer of metamorphosed pillow breccias with a hyaloclastite matrix is exposed east of Maggie Hays Hill and north of Mount Day. The fragments are heterogeneous and up to 10 cm in diameter. Some are flattened, angular, and aligned in a fine-grained matrix of feldspar, biotite, and altered glass. Fine-grained mafic clasts are typically altered. In the upper part of the Maggie Hays Formation, metabasalts are intercalated with thin, metamorphosed iron- and silica-rich interflow sedimentary rocks, which become more abundant towards the top of the formation. The interflow sedimentary rocks are commonly finely laminated, with banded cherts up to 50 cm thick or pelite less than 10 cm thick.  The irregular outcrop and the complexity of the deformation make it difficult to define the overall younging direction. However, weakly deformed pillow structures in the western part of the greenstone belt consistently indicate younging to the west (e.g. SSRJHS000500, Zone 51, MGA 288406E 6416370N). It is in sheared contact with internal granitic rocks (i.e. granites within the greenstone belt) near Maggie Hays Hill (SSRJHS000241, Zone 51, MGA 273997E 6425719N).

The type section is the interval 2967-3501 m in Kidson 1. Lehmann (1984) also recognized an informal  lower Mallowa Salt  over the interval 3419-3501 m, separated from the main unit by a widespread ca. 10 m shale horizon.",,"The followering is modified from Haines (2009). The Mallowa Salt comprises beds of halite interbedded with red, green, grey, and black mudstone, with lesser anhydrite and dolomite. The formation is cored in relatively few petroleum wells, so in most areas information is restricted to cuttings and wireline log data. Most of the formation is cored, however, in BHP potash exploration drillholes Gingerah Hill 1 and Brooke 1 in the Willara Sub-basin, and the following descriptions are substantially derived from these holes. Detailed descriptions are presented in BHP Minerals Exploration (1987), BHP-UTAH Minerals International (1989), Cathro (1989), and Cathro et al. (1992). Two cores (13 and 14) are available from the Kidson 1 type section. Halite petrography in Kidson 1 is described in Glover (1973). The halite varies in colour from clear and colourless to red-brown. Glover (1973) suggests that the red-brown colour is due to inclusions of ferric hydrate, a precursor of hematite, and appears mainly to be found in halite that has undergone reprecipitation.  The Mallowa Salt is notably cyclic; Cathro et al. (1992) recognize 2-15 m thick dolomite/anhydrite-halite-mudstone Type 1 cycles, and much more common (95% of halite sequence) 1-4 m thick halite-mudstone Type 2 cycles. The halite unit in both cycles comprises a mosaic of large random interlocking crystals, resulting mainly from recrystallization during early diagenesis. Relics of vertically elongate and chevron crystals, interpreted as primary fabrics, are preserved locally.  A typical Type 1 cycle consists of (Cathro et al., 1992): &bull; Terrigenous mudstone (top) &bull; Banded halite with variable, upwardly increasing clay content &bull; Clear, coarsely crystalline halite &bull; Massive to laminated anhydrite &bull; Dolomite (base)  A typical Type 2 cycle consists of (Cathro et al., 1992): &bull; Terrigenous mudstone (top) &bull; Banded halite with variable, upwardly increasing clay content &bull; Clear, coarsely crystalline halite (base)  The vertical Type 1 cycle approximates the theoretically predicted precipitation sequence for evaporative concentration of sea water, except that with modern seawater aragonite and gypsum, rather than dolomite and anhydrite would be expected. The Type 2 cycles are interpreted as incomplete Type 1 cycles, lacking the lower dolomite and anhydrite portions (Cathro et al, 1992).  The Mallowa Salt can be subdivided using widespread shale markers aided with the gamma ray and particularly the gamma ray-derived INPEFA curve (Haines, 2009). Two thicker markers lie stratigraphically near the base and top of the formation, respectively. The lower of these, up to 10 m in thickness was used by Lehmann (1984) to mark the top of a  lower Mallowa member  in Kidson 1, McLarty 1, and Willara 1, but this horizon can now be recognized in the majority of wells intersecting the Mallowa Salt. This shale marker is at the approximate position of the B1/B2 supersequence boundary recognized by Romine et al. (1994) and Kennard et al. (1994). The upper shale marker, up to 15 m thick, is only recognized in Brooke 1, Pegasus 1, Sally May 1, and McLarty 1 where the most complete salt sections are found. Elsewhere, the inferred time equivalent of this shale interval lies either within the zone of salt dissolution or above the depositional top of the salt, and can thus not be distinguished. Thin shale markers throughout the formation can commonly be correlated between nearby and sometimes distance wells with high to moderate confidence.",,,,,,,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,458.4,,433.4,,,No,,,3,,No,DE in Progress,No,No,OS,CRa,,,,,MIGSDPH,2.02E+13,,No,No

The leucotroctolite is interlayered with anorthosite, olivine gabbro, olivine-rich troctolite, gabbro, and gabbronorite.

The main leucotroctolite zone overlies olivine gabbro, and structurally overlies both gabbronorite and gabbro to the northwest. In outcrop, the leucotroctolite commonly contains layers of glomeroporphyritic-textured olivine, which show broad cross-bedding that suggests younging to the southwest.

The intrusion includes a thin, basal pyroxenite layer that is interpreted to be a cumulate layer, a middle medium- to coarse-grained gabbroic unit, and an upper unit of medium-grained dolerite. The gabbroic rocks include two magmatic cycles, which grade from melanocratic to leucocratic, with a very thin pyroxenite unit at the boundary between the two cycles.

","The Mapa Igneous Complex is named after the Ngaanyatjarra word for Mount Cumming, which forms a prominent hill in the range defined by the intrusion. ",,"The Mapa Igneous Complex is composed of a basal, thin pyroxenite layer, an overlying gabbroic unit, and an upper dolerite. The pyroxenite is dark-green, inequigranular to equigranular, and medium- to very coarse-grained.

175,23763,P_-_mr-mh,1,Marboo Formation,1,"Thin-bedded, turbiditic metasandstone and quartzâ€“chloriteâ€“muscovite phyllite; hornfelsed adjacent to granite intrusions","The c. 1872-1864 Ma Marboo Formation contains the oldest rocks in the western zone of the Paleoproterozoic Lamboo Province. The basement of the western zone is not exposed but is probably the early Paleoproterozoic Kimberley Craton (Sheppard et al., 2012). The top of the formation is not exposed, either eroded or intruded by granites and high-level porphyries of the Paperbark Supersuite in the west Kimberley region and Sally Downs Supersuite in the east Kimberley region. The true thickness of the formation is unknown but has been noted to be in excess of 7000 m (Hancock, 1991) although this might be tectonically thickened by layer-parallel faulting and isoclinal folding (Tyler et al., 1999). The formation is intruded by mafic sills of the Ruins Dolerite and unconformably overlain by the c. 1864-1854 Ma Whitewater Volcanics and younger Paleoproterozoic Speewah and Kimberley Basins.  The Marboo Formation is a thick package of low- to high-grade metasedimentary rocks of turbiditic origin, variously deformed and metamorphosed (Tyler et al., 1999, 2012). The formation is dominated by metamorphosed siliciclastic rocks with varying proportions of quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragments, siltstone, and claystone, and minor carbonate layers. Metadacitic and metarhyolitic tuffs have been previously identified but may be questionable and have been reinterpreted as higher grade equivalents of the turbidite sediments (Tyler et al., 1999; see lithology narrative). The Marboo Formation has reached greenschist metamorphic facies with amphibolite facies in association with felsic and mafic intrusions.  The formation is considered to have been deposited in a mid to outer fan setting sourced from a mature, continental province and a magmatic arc or orogenic source (Griffin et al., 1998; Tyler et al., 1999). Paleocurrent data indicate a source from the north and northwest (Hancock, 1991) from an area now covered by the Speewah and Kimberley Basins (Tyler et al., 1999).","The Marboo Formation is found in a discontinuous belt of Paleoproterozoic crystalline rock, restricted to the western zone of the Lamboo Province, bounding the eastern and southern margins of the Speewah and Kimberley Basins.","The Marboo Formation is named after the thin-bedded metaturbidites outcropping at Marboo Pool (Lat. -16&deg; 32' 28'' S, Long. 123&deg; 57' 42'' E), on the Townshend River on the YAMPI 1:250 000 map sheet (Tyler and Griffin, 1993).",,"The Marboo Formation has been divided into two units based lithofacies differences (Griffin et al., 1993; Tyler et al., 1999). The Lower Unit is thicker bedded with a higher proportion of sandstone to finer grained lithologies whereas the Upper Unit is thinner bedded with more fine-grained beds.  Lower Unit: The Lower Unit has been recorded up to 3000 m thick in the Richenda Anticline (located in the Richenda Gorge and River area, approximately 15 km southwest of Mount Broome on the LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 map sheet; Hancock, 1991). This great exposure may be tectonic thickened as a result of layer-parallel faulting and isoclinal folding (Tyler et al., 1999). The Lower Unit is a turbiditic package of metamorphosed quartzo-feldspathic wacke, siltstone, and claystone. The sandstone beds can be up to 10 m thick with current laminations as well as lenticular and climbing ripples preserved near their tops. At the base of sandstone beds load casts and erosional features such as scours channels are seen (Griffin et al., 1993). Petrography of the Lower Unit sandstones revealed that they were generally composed of 70% rounded quartz and 30% plagioclase (An 26 -An 40 ) with minor perthite in a metamorphosed/recrystallised matrix (Hancock, 1991). Accessory minerals include zircon, rutile, and tourmaline. Calcareous layers are found throughout the unit. No paleocurrent directions can be discerned from this division of the Marboo Formation. The Ruins Dolerite intrudes the contact between the Lower and Upper Units.  Upper Unit: The Upper Unit is thought to be up to 3500 m in Richenda Anticline; although this may not be a true thickness as once again the formation could be tectonically thickened (Tyler et al., 1999). A claystone-calcareous claystone package has been observed at the base of the unit in some areas (Hancock, 1991). The majority of the unit consists of < 1 m thick beds of variably metamorphosed claystone, siltstone, feldspathic and quartzose greywacke, and quartz wacke (Griffin et al., 1993). Sandstones are 10-30 cm thick, fine- or medium-grained, parallel laminated near the top, and composed of 50-80% subangular quartz in a peltic matrix. Upper Unit metasandstone beds commonly show normal grading into a finer grained material with sharp basal contacts between metasandstone-metasiltstone/metaclaystone packages. Hancock (1991) noted that the wackes contained 10-30% acid volcanic fragments, 10-30% phyllitic fragments, 0-10% K-feldspar and rare plagioclase, 0-5% quartzite fragments, 0-5% chert fragments, and rare pieces of vein quartz. Abundant detrital tourmaline is present with accessory apatite, allanite, rutile, zircon, and iron oxides. Very coarse-grained beds are found locally. Analysis of forty-four flute casts reveals a paleoflow from the north and northwest from the Upper Unit in the southwest of the western Lamboo Province (Hancock, 1991). Calcareous layers and concretions have been observed throughout the Upper Unit. Gellatly et al. (1974) and Hancock (1991) described thin beds of &ldquo;acid to intermediate crystal lithic tuff&rdquo; from the Upper Unit. These were redescribed as rocks similar to the rest of the unit (metaturbidites) of higher metamorphic grade. A dacitic to rhyodacitic lithic crystal tuff of Hancock (1991) was called a quartz-plagioclase-muscovite-(biotite) semischist by Tyler et al. (1999). Similar beds described as lithic crystal tuff near the top of the upper unit by Griffin et al. (1993) may, likewise, be higher grade metasedimentary units. Thorne et al. (1999) only found the Upper Unit in the Marboo exposures east of the Ragged Range and in the Wilson River area on the LISSADELL 1:250 000 map sheet. These exposures were originally described as phyllitic shale and siltstone with interbedded quartz wacke and quartzite assigned to the Olympio Formation by Gellatly and Derrick (1967). In these locations Thorne et al. (1999) described packages of metasandstone with normal grading to metasiltstone and metaclaystone, interpreted as Bouma turbidite divisions T ADE . The sandstones are composed of subangular to subrounded quartz, plagioclase, and K-feldspar as well as quartz-feldspar lithic fragments in a recrystallised matrix (Thorne et al., 1999). The larger volume of fine-grained sediment over sandstone suggests that these outcrops are mostly the upper unit defined by Griffin et al. (1993) and Tyler et al. (1999). Many of the outcrops on the YAMPI and LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 map sheets described by Tyler et al. (1999) and Griffin et al. (1993), respectively, contain 10-30 cm thick beds of sharp-based, parallel fine- to medium-grained, normally graded metasandstone with subangular quartz grains in a metaclaystone matrix. Rocks of the Upper Unit are assigned to Bouma division T BDE  by Tyler and Griffin (1993). Detrital tourmaline is abundant in the Upper Unit, a common feature of the Marboo Formation across the western Lamboo Province, along with lesser apatite, allanite, rutile, zircon, and iron oxides. On LISSADELL a thin-bedded limestone has been found unit near the top of the formation (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967). This lithofacies is not described anywhere else from the Marboo Formation outcrops and could possibly be a thicker expression of the calcareous layers seen throughout the formation.  Gellatly et al. (1969) described the Creek Group in the Hawkstone Creek area on the CHARNLEY 1:250 000 map sheet (later reassigned to the Marboo Formation) as consisting of phyllite, porphyroblastic mica schists, and quartzite. Sericitic phyllite is the most abundant lithofacies on CHARNLEY being buff-grey coloured, thin-bedded, and laminated to flaggy, composed of alternating bands of quartz, quartz and muscovite, or muscovite, with biotite-chlorite being less common (Gellatly et al., 1969). Rutile and tourmaline are common detrital components. Quartzites are fawn or grey, thin bedded, fine-grained, poorly cleaved, flaggy to fissile, with mica aggregates along bedding planes. Porphyroblasts of actinolite and rare andalusite are present with phyllitic interbeds, ripples, normal grading, cross-stratification, convolute bedding, flame and pull apart structures. Mica schists are also common with porphyroblasts of andalusite, chloritoid, stubby and elongate stuarolite, garnet 2-10 mm long, and kyanite 1-5 mm long. Andalusite crystals are 1-10 mm long and can constitute up to 10% of the rock. Sericite aggregates form andalusite pseudomorphs. A rare kyanite schist was noted in the Hawkstone-Alexander Creeks area, associated with lenses of kyanite rock, corundum rock, and kyanite-topaz rock. The kyanite rock contains 1-2 mm kyanite porphyroblasts in a fine-grained topaz matrix. Tourmaline and rutile are common detrital components. The kyanite-bearing rocks are found in an outcrop 400 m long (Gellatly et al., 1969). Hornfels is found in contact with granites of the Paperbark Supersuite (e.g. biotite-andalustie-quartz-granofels). ","The Marboo Formation is interpreted as a deep marine, turbiditic package of metasedimentary rocks source from a &ldquo;mature quartzose to quartzo-feldspathic hinterland with some acid volcanic material interlayered or overlying granite&rdquo; (Hancock, 1991). More specifically the thicker bedded and quartz-rich sandier Lower Unit of the Marboo Formation is considered to have been deposited in a mid fan setting with the lack of lithic fragments indicating that material was sourced from a mature, continental province (Griffin et al., 1993; Tyler et al., 1999). The Upper Unit turbidites were probably deposited in a more distal, lower fan setting with the constituent acid volcanic fragments and low grade quartz-rich metasediment and lithics indicating the material was sourced from a magmatic arc or orogenic source (Griffin et al., 1998; Tyler et al., 1999). Purported tuffs in the Upper Unit of the formation are considered to be precursor volcanogenic material to the Whitewater Volcanics (Griffin et al., 1993). Palaeocurrent data indicate a source for the turbidites from the north and northeast (Hancock, 1991) from an area now covered by the Speewah and Kimberley Basins (Tyler et al., 1999).",,7000,,"The Marboo Formation is the oldest unit in the western zone of the Lamboo Province and neither the base nor top of the Marboo Formation is exposed. The basement of the western zone is not exposed but is considered to be earliest Paleoproterozoic crust. The formation is intruded by the Ruins Dolerite and Mount Joseph Migmatite. All of these units were deformed during D1/M1 in the western Lamboo Province (Tyler et al., 1995). The Marboo Formation is also intruded by the various granitic bodies of the Paperbark and Sally Downs Supersuites which as either immediately pre- or syn-D2/M2 (Tyler et al., 1999). The formation is unconformably overlain by the Whitewater Volcanics (coeval with Paperbark Supersuite emplacement). The Marboo Formation is also unconformably overlain by the younger Paleoproterozoic rocks of the Speewah and Kimberley Groups. The formation underwent further deformation during the Yampi Orogeny (1475-1000 Ma), the King Leopold Orogeny (c. 560 Ma), and the Speilers Event (c. 500 Ma; Tyler et al., 1999).",,17,,,,4,,,,1872,,1864,,"The following geochronology data from the Marboo Formation is taken from Tyler et al.

A maximum depositional age for the formation comes from a zircon core dated at 1872 Â± 9 Ma.

It is an undeformed alkali granite characterized by abundant muscovite and distinctive accessory fluorite. This unit is the youngest dated granite of the Bald Rock Supersuite (Wogala Suite) and the youngest dated Archean rock in the Youanmi Terrane.,"The Marlomumbah Granite is a single pluton located to the east of the Weld Range on MADOONGA. The interpreted outcrop (Ivanic, 2009) is an irregular and elongate form along a northeast-trending axis, approximately 10 km long and 2 km wide. This form is also evident on aeromagnetic surveys.","This unit is named after the nearby Marlomumbah Well (Zone 50 MGA 604000E 7051000N), located on MADOONGA (Ivanic, 2009; Van Kranendonk and Ivanic, 2009).  The type locality for the Marlomumbah Granite is the same as for the Wogala Suite as a whole (A-BRO-gfv).",,"This granite has an equigranular texture with a variable grain size (2-8 mm).  The modal proportions for the majority of the pluton consist of approximately: 50% alkali feldspar, 25% plagioclase, 15% quartz, 5% muscovite, 5% biotite, <1% fluorite and <1% oxides. K-feldspar phenocrysts may be present, locally up to 15 mm in size set in a finer-grained matrix.  Igneous foliation primarily marked by preferred alignment of euhedral K-feldspar phenocrysts is prominent towards the margins of the pluton. No penetrative deformation is generally visible. Minor metamorphic chlorite is observed mainly at the edges of biotite crystals.

2258,11353,A-HAm-cib,4129,Marra Mamba Iron Formation,1,"Chert, banded iron-formation, mudstone, and siltstone; minor carbonate; metamorphosed","The Marra Mamba Iron Formation is the lowermost unit of the Hamersley Group that marks the onset of extensive banded iron-formation (BIF) deposition and forms an invaluable marker that outlines the principal structural elements of the central part of the southern Pilbara region. Regional correlation of a c. 2630 Ma impact spherule layer indicates that the Marra Mamba Iron Formation is a partial lateral correlative of the Carawine Dolomite. The bulk of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation consists of distinctively podded, yellow-weathering BIF and chert, as well as thin shale beds and lesser carbonate that were predominantly deposited in a pelagic environment in front of a carbonate shelf.   The Marra Mamba Iron Formation conformably overlies the Roy Hill Member of the Jeerinah Formation, and is gradationally overlain by the West Angela Member of the Wittenoom Dolomite. The depositional age of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation is constrained between c. 2629 and 2597 Ma. Iron ore deposits within the Marra Mamba Iron Formation are characterized by low levels of deleterious elements such as phosphorus and alumina, making it one of the most economically important units in the region. The Marra Mamba Iron Formation is also well known for its deposits of crocidolite asbestos.","The Marra Mamba Iron Formation is present throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region, where it is exposed on the YARRALOOLA, PYRAMID, WYLOO, MOUNT BRUCE, ROY HILL, BALFOUR DOWNS, TUREE CREEK, NEWMAN, and ROBERTSON 1:250 000 map sheets. The formation has an average thickness of about 180-230 m throughout most of the outcrop area (Blockley et al., 1993), but is apparently less than 30 m thick near Mount Florance Station on PYRAMID (MacLeod et al., 1963). Thickness variations are also strongly dependent on the extent of iron enrichment, with mineralized sections characterized by reduced thickness.","The Marra Mamba Iron Formation was defined by MacLeod et al. (1963), who defined a type section at Marra Mamba (Zone 50, MGA 522750E 7532220N) in the west-central part of the southern Pilbara region. Early subdivision of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation, first by Ryan and Blockley (1965) and then by Trendall and Blockley (1970), recognized an informal twofold and later a threefold subdivision, as well as identifying a number of crocidolite-bearing horizons that were initially used for correlation. The threefold subdivision of Trendall and Blockley (1970) was later formalized from bottom to top as the Nammuldi, MacLeod and Mount Newman Members by Blockley et al. (1993). In addition to the formally recognized lithostratigraphy, there is a commonly recognized informal subdivision of these member level units that is used by the iron-ore mining companies on a prospect to deposit scale. These subdivisions are based on the recognition of distinctive marker horizons and shale beds that are easily identified in natural gamma-ray logs. Shale beds are numbered according to their stratigraphic position within each member, but unlike the similar nomenclature used for the Dales Gorge Member, the banded iron-formation intervals are usually not numbered in the Marra Mamba Iron Formation. The shale bands in the Nammuldi Member are designated as US1-18, in the MacLeod Member as MS1-13, and in the Mount Newman Member as NS1-8.",,"The Marra Mamba Iron Formations are characterized by low levels of deleterious elements such as phosphorus and alumina, making it one of the most economically important units in the region (Harmsworth et al., 1990).   The Marra Mamba Iron Formation consists predominantly of distinctively podded, yellow-weathering BIF and chert, as well as thin shale mesobands and lesser carbonate (MacLeod, 1966; Trendall and Blockley, 1970), and lacks the distinctive macrobanding that characterizes the Dales Gorge Member of the Brockman Iron Formation. Magnetite mesobanding is absent, and chert mesobanding is generally rather thick with coarse microbanding that is commonly indistinct (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). Both the weathering pattern and topographic expression of the formation are controlled by shale distribution, mesobanding characteristics, chert structure, and mineralogy (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). Rare dolerite sills locally intrude the base of the Nammuldi Member in the Weeli Wolli Anticline, Turee Creek Syncline, and southwest of Newman.   Three main crocidolite-bearing horizons have been recognized in the Marra Mamba Iron Formation, some of which have been economically exploited in the past and used for early stratigraphic correlation prior to the recognition of formal subdivisions. These crocidolite seams are spatially associated with zones of riebeckite enrichment, of which there is one named horizon (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). The lowermost crocidolite horizon is about 40 m above the base of the formation, within the Nammuldi Member, and is known as the Mackay Crocidolite Horizon. The Dun Crocidolite Horizon is about 80 m above the base, also within the Nammuldi Member, and the Foxall Crocidolite Horizon is located at the contact with the overlying MacLeod Member. The Vivash Riebeckite Zone is situated at the contact between the MacLeod and Mount Newman Members of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation, extending mostly into the Mount Newman Member, and locally contains crocidolite.","The demonstrable lateral correlation with the Carawine Dolomite (Simonson et al. 1993; Rasmussen et al., 2005) and the gradational stratigraphic relationship with the overlying Wittenoom Formation combined with its carbonate-rich composition and lack of any indication of deposition above storm wave-base, suggests that the Marra Mamba Iron Formation was deposited in front of a carbonate shelf in a pelagic environment (Morris and Horwitz, 1983; Rasmussen et al., 2005; Hurst et al., 2013). There are no specific facies-based studies of the depositional environment of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation, but studies of Hamersley Group banded iron-formation in general suggest deposition and reworking of hydrothermal muds, followed by sea-floor silicification (KrapeÅ¾ et al. 2003; Pickard et al., 2004) in the basinal environment of the Hamersley Range passing into a carbonate ramp-to-shelf environment in the Chichester Range (Hurst et al., 2013).",,230,,"The Marra Mamba Iron Formation conformably overlies the Roy Hill Member of the Jeerinah Formation, and is gradationally overlain by the West Angela Member of the overlying Wittenoom Dolomite (Trendall and Blockley, 1970; Blockley et al., 1993). The slumped basal contact suggested by Horwitz and Ramanaido (1993) is now identified as part of the Soda Fault (Johnson et al., 2013). In other areas where the basal contact appears to be weakly discordant (e.g. Radio Hill at Paraburdoo, and DMMHAM000305 Zone 50, MGA 703821E 7445401N) this discordance can also be attributed to faulting or bedding-parallel shearing (possibly due to flexural slip during folding).",,17,,,,4,,,,2629,,2597,5,"The maximum age of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation is constrained by a tuff bed in the uppermost Jeerinah Formation that has been dated at 2629 Â± 5 Ma (Trendall et al., 2004).

It consists of two siltstone and mudstone intervals separated by a central sandstone (or, in Dirk Hartog 1B, dolomite) interval, that were deposited in sabkha and nearshore marine conditions and generally have an oxidised appearance. The member appears to thin away from the Dirk Hartog area, from 148 m in Dirk Hartog 17B to 100 m in Yaringa 1, 75 m in Tamala 1, 65 m in Coburn 1, and 53 m in Kalbarri 1.

The unit is composed of greenschist facies meta-andesite to metatrachyte and associated volcaniclastic rocks interbedded with metasedimentary carbonate rocks and polymictic carbonate-siliciclastic breccia beds. Subordinate lithologies consist of ferruginous metachert and interbedded turbidite metasandstone and metasiltstone of the underlying and overlying Olympio Formation. The Maude Headley Member represents submarine volcanism with breccia beds, most likely to result from sliding and slumping on volcano flanks. A porphyritic felsic metavolcanic rock from the Maude Headley Member was sampled for SHRIMP U-Pb zircon geochronology and yielded a weighted mean 207Pb*/206Pb* date of 1856 Â± 5 Ma, which is interpreted as the age of volcanism.","The Maude Headley Member is exposed over 700 km 2  (Warren, 1997) in a series of north-northeasterly trending outcrops on the very northeast of HALLS CREEK, southeastern MCINTOSH, and southwestern DIXON. The most aerially extensive outcrops are found west of Mount Coghlan (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 393827E 8009195N), north of the Sophie Downs Dome and Saunders Creek Dome on northeastern HALLS CREEK, and southeastern MCINTOSH. Smaller exposures of the Maude Headley Member extend to the north, west of the Dry Creek Mine (DIXON, Zone 52, MGA 394445E 8015991N) and further north into the Bay of Biscay Hills and Grant Peak (MCINTOSH, Zone 52, MGA 395124E 8032217N).","Warren (1997) described metamorphosed A-type volcanic rocks and volcaniclastic units in the northern part of 1:250 000 map sheet GORDON DOWNS and the southern part of 1:250 000 map sheet DIXON RANGE as the Maude Headley Volcanic Member. Subsequent mapping referred to these rocks as Maude Headley Member (Tyler et al., 1997; Blake et al., 1999a,b), but the unit was not defined. The formal definition of the Maude Headley Member is presented in Blake et al. (2000).  The Maude Headley Member is named after the Maude Headley gold prospect (MCINTOSH, Zone 52, MGA 388623E 8013788N), about 7 km northwest of Mount Coghlan (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 393827E 8009195N). The type section is preserved along a gorge on the Panton River in the Bay of Biscay Hills between DIXON, Zone 52, MGA 394509E 8020303N and MCINTOSH Zone 52, MGA 393179E 8020175N.",,"The Maude Headley Member consists of up to 1000 m of greenschist facies felsic and mafic alkaline volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, calcareous sedimentary rocks, and breccia and lesser siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. The member is situated 50 to 100 m stratigraphically above the base of the Olympio Formation, overlying siliciclastic metasedimentary units, which are interpreted to have been deposited from turbidity currents (P_-HCo-xmt-ml, P_-HCo-mt, and P_-HCo-mh). The base of the member is commonly marked by matrix-supported, poorly sorted, 50 cm to 1 m-thick, polymictic breccia beds. Clasts are angular, up to 30 cm long, and composed of laminated or massive metasedimentary carbonate, metachert, vein quartz, recrystallized psammitic and phyllitic material, banded and massive aphyric metavolcanic rocks, feldspar-phyric and aphyric metavolcanic fragments with quartz amygdales, and vesicular metabasalt and metarhyolite. Volcanic bombs and scoria are found in some breccia beds with possible pumice breccia, intercalated with beds of granule breccia, metasiltstone, and metasandstone. Some breccia beds have normal grading. The breccia matrix is commonly a crystalline or schistose, fine-grained metacarbonate, or less commonly a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic metasandstone matrix. Breccia beds are overlain by thick-bedded, very fine-grained metacarbonate, or metamorphosed calcarenite units, which contain <1 cm-thick, highly siliceous, and discontinuous beds or lenses. These basal units are overlain by thick-bedded, meta-andesitic and metatrachytic volcanic, and volcaniclastic material, which is commonly fine-grained and equigranular. Warren (1997) also noted that basal lithologies could consist of a package of thin-bedded, siliceous metavolcanic rocks to thicker bedded, pillowed metarhyolite, overlain by fragmental felsic metavolcanic rocks with a carbonate matrix. Calcite also infills vesicles in pillow lavas.  Warren (1997) noted massive rhyolite forming large hills southeast of the Maude Headley gold prospect (MCINTOSH, Zone 52, MGA 388623E 8013788N), while laminated chert and carbonate form prominent crests on anticlinal axes between the abandoned Dry Creek Mine (DIXON, Zone 52, MGA 394445E 8015991N) and the Grants Patch area (MCINTOSH, Zone 52, MGA 386380E 8028804N). Northwest of Grant Peak (MCINTOSH, Zone 52, MGA 395124E 8032217N), laminated units are capped by about 20 m of black carbonate rock and a thin crystal tuff (Warren, 1997).  A sill of the Maude Headley Member intrudes Biscay Formation south of Dry Creek Mine. The sill is up to a few hundred metres thick and has a granophyric texture in the northern extent, suggestive of the upper part of a layered sill. The sill may be compositionally layered and contains fluorite and abundant zircon euhedra (Warren, 1997).  The volcanic units are intercalated with siliciclastic turbiditic rocks similar to those of the underlying and overlying Olympio Formation (P_-HCo-xmt-ml, P_-HCo-mt, and P_-HCo-mh).","The Maude Headley Member was emplaced onto, and is intercalated with, siliciclastic metasedimentary rocks of the Olympio Formation (P_-HCo-xmt-ml). Siliciclastic metasedimentary rocks in the Olympio Formation are interpreted to have been deposited by a series of turbidity currents in middle to lower fan settings (Hancock, 1991; Griffin and Tyler, 1993; Warren, 1997; Tyler, et al., 1998; Blake et al., 1999b; Phillips et al., 2016).  The metacarbonate clasts in polymictic breccias may be derived from a shallow-marine environment or from hydrothermal venting associated with local felsic and mafic volcanic centres. Hydrothermal activity at the time of volcanism is also indicated by the silicified lava clasts incorporated in unaltered breccia (Phillips et al., 2016). Chert-carbonate layers may be an exhalative deposit as a result of siliceous and CO 2 -rich fluids (Warren, 1997). Warren also noted that the volcanic complex may have evolved from small-scale eruptions of felsic tuff and thin flows to explosive, vapour-rich stage, followed by the growth of domes of viscous rhyolite and slow discharge of fluids enriched in SiO 2  and CO 2 .  Fine-grained, volcaniclastic rocks and pumice breccia are consistent with deep subaqueous environments and may indicate explosive volcanism, distally in a subaerial setting or locally in a subaqueous setting. The confining pressure of deep-water is an impediment to explosive volcanic eruptions (Kokelaar, 1986). Generally, explosive, pumice-and ash-forming eruptions take place in water depths of <1000 m (Kokelaar, 1986; Garcia et al., 2006). However, magma composition and gas chemistry and content will influence the depth of explosive eruption. If a mafic magma is high in CO 2  and/or H 2 S, then violent eruptions can take place at depths of more than 1000 km below sea level (e.g. Loihi volcano, 1200 m; Schipper et al., 2010).",,1000,,"The Maude Headley Member was emplaced onto, and is intercalated with, metasedimentary rocks of the Olympio Formation (P_-HCo-xmt-ml). This relationship is commonly conformable although, due to the structural complexity in the area, some fault contacts are noted. The member is commonly in fault contact with the underlying Biscay Formation, with some minor intrusive contacts (e.g. south of the Dry Creek Mine on DIXON, Zone 52 MGA 394445E 8015991N; Warren, 1997). The Woodward Dolerite intrudes the Maude Headley Member in a small number of places, e.g. less than 3 km southwest of Grant Peak on MCINTOSH, Zone 52, MGA 395124E 8032217N). In its most northern extent, the Maude Headley Member crops out in two very thin north-northeasterly trending exposures against the Halls Creek Fault south of the Ord River Small and Black Point (DIXON, Zone 52, MGA 411676E 8062183N).

The lower part of the formation is particularly recessive, and may contain more siltstone. The formation is largely restricted to Western Australia (WA), but extends to the western part of the MOUNT RENNIE 1:250 000 scale map sheet area in the Northern Territory (NT). It is thickest in the south, possibly up to 3600 m in the southern Wallace Hills (RAWLINSON 1:250 000 map sheet), but generally thins to the north. The Maurice Formation is interpreted as a braided fluvial succession deposited contemporaneously with uplift of the Musgrave region and southern margin of the Amadeus Basin during to 580-520 Ma Petermann Orogeny. Detrital zircon age spectra and the paleocurrent data (directed towards the northwest to north) are consistent with such a provenance (Haines et al., 2015).

It is locally pebbly, particularly near the Sir Frederick Range, but this isn't a regionally significant component. Cross-bedding is very common, and can be of large scale, with massive to plane-laminated beds also present. The sandstone is typically red-brown or purple-brown when fresh, but may weather to yellow or white locally. The sandstone in commonly texturally immature, being poorly-sorted with abundant clay matrix. It is also mineralogically immature, being lithic, feldspathic and micaceous. Heavy mineral bands are locally common. While some outcrops develop hard surface silicification, the majority are weathered and friable. Where pebbly, the clasts are rounded, up to a few centimetres in size, and composed of quartzite, silicified quartz sandstone, vein quartz, and chert. Interbedded siltstones are commonly red-brown and micaceous. Beds containing red mud clasts are common in the sandstone, suggesting erosion and reworking of the siltstone units.","The Maurice Formation is inferred to be mainly of braided fluvial origin, including channel and flood plain facies.

571,74822,A-ANM-xony-amy,63,Meeline Suite,1,"Layered maficâ€“ultramafic intrusive rocks; gabbro with subordinate anorthosite, magnetitite, and ultramafic cumulate rocks; metamorphosed","The main components of the Meeline Suite are, in order of size: the Windimurra, Youanmi, Barrambie, Atley and Lady Alma Igneous Complexes (Ivanic et al., 2010) and the Buddadoo Gabbro. Volumetrically, the suite is estimated as second only to the Bushveld system, South Africa (Ivanic et al., 2017). The focal region for these complexes is a 220 x 120 km expanse within the central Youanmi Terrane, western Yilgarn Craton. They intrude into Norie Group host rocks. Intrusion of the complexes was likely broadly contemporaneous with the intrusion of granitic rocks of the Mount Kenneth Suite and felsic volcanic members within the Yaloginda Formation of the Norie Group, which are also dated at c. 2813 Ma.  Rocks of this suite are typically modally layered gabbroic and minor ultramafic cumulates. Layering of each lithology varies from centimetre- to decametre-scale and also up to hectometre-scale megacyclic layering, typically from a pyroxenitic base to a leucogabbro top. Lower zones of the complexes are dominantly gabbroic and the upper zones host more magnetite-rich leucogabbro and anorthosite. Ultramafic zones of these complexes are typically unexposed or detached from the main bodies along shear zones. However, it is inferred from geophysical data that thick, layered ultramafic sequences underlie the Windimurra and the Youanmi Igneous Complex. Locally, dolerite is preserved at the margins of the complexes, which is interpreted to represent a chilled marginal border zone facies.   The primary mineralogy of the suite is typically mafic-ultramafic and nearly entirely anhydrous. Textures range from ophitic orthocumulate to adcumulate with local porphyritic and finer-grained facies. The more evolved upper zones of the complexes are characteristically iron-rich, and are host to magnetitite horizons. These form a multitude of targets for vanadium exploration and mining. The suite is also associated with lesser orthomagmatic Ni-Cu-Cr-PGE and peripheral Cu-Pb-Zn mineralization.","The focus for igneous complexes of the Meeline Suite is over 220 x 120 km areal extent in the central Youanmi Terrane. This region is located in the eastern Murchison Domain with several of the complexes preserved along shear zones that define the Murchison-Southern Cross Domain boundary. The suite occurs on GABANINTHA, NOWTHANNA, WYNYANGOO, WOODLEY, YOUNO DOWNS, SANDSTONE, CHALLA, WINDIMURRA, COOLAMANINU, YOUANMI, MELLENBYE and BADJA.   The Meeline Suite has not been documented east of the Barrambie Igneous Complex and hence is not clearly prevalent in the Southern Cross Domain. The Buddadoo Igneous Complex, though without chonological constraints, is likely the westernmost complex of the suite, which is located approximately 50 km southwest of Yalgoo. Seismic data indicate that the thickest igneous complex, the Windimurra Igneous Complex, occurs down to a depth of about 11 km  where it is likely in contact with basement gneisses (Ivanic and Brett, 2015). The complexes are typically emplaced into and juxtaposed against Norie Group volcanic and sedimentary rocks. ","The Meeline Suite (Ivanic et al. 2010) is named after the Meeline Homestead (Zone 50 MGA 624000E 6853000N), located on CHALLA.   The type section for the Meeline Suite is the same as for the Windimurra Igneous Complex (A-ANwi-xony-am) as follows: This section comprises a traverse from east to west across the Windimurra Hills to the Windimurra vanadium pit. The start of the traverse (at site TJIWIN000062, Zone 50, MGA 654321E 6869458N) is in the lower zone of the eastern lobe where modally layered olivine gabbronorites and leucogabbros dominate. Moving 1 km to the west, intercumulus magnetite enters the gabbroic lithologies marking the start of the middle zone. It is within this part of the middle zone that a late stage gabbroic pegmatite has been dated at 2813 Â± 3 Ma (GSWA 194747; Wingate et al., 2012), which is interpreted to represent the age of the complex as a whole (at site CLKWIN090003, Zone 50, MGA 627876E 6880157N). At the end of the traverse (at site TJIWIN000124, Zone 50, MGA 650233E 6869373N) thick cumulate horizons of magnetitite interlayered with leucogabbro are exposed in the faces of the Windimurra vanadium pit, marking the start of the upper zone. More details can be found in field trip guide books (e.g. Localities 3.1-3.2; Ivanic, 2016). ",,"Rocks of the Meeline Suite are typically modally layered gabbroic and ultramafic cumulates. Layering within each lithology varies from a centimetre to a decametre vertical scale and can be gradational or sharp. Graded layers (i.e. involving grain size gradation) are present but are typically not distinct. On a larger scale, repetitive cyclical layering from a melagabbro-pyroxenitic base to an anorthositic top over a ~200 m vertical scale is the dominant layering style. Textures vary from orthocumulate-mesocumulate-adcumulate-pegmatitic with orthocumulate being the most abundant in gabbroic units and meso-adcumulate being the most abundant in ultramafic units.   Dolerite at the chilled margins (border zones) of the igneous complexes have been observed at the Windimurra, Youanmi and Atley Igneous complexes, though these are not extensively preserved and are typically deformed and metamorphosed. The ultramafic zones at the bases of these igneous complexes are typically unexposed or detached from the main body of the complex along adjacent shear zones (Ivanic et al. 2010). However, deep seismic reflection data suggest that the Windimurra Igneous Complex likely has a thick, subsurface ultramafic zone contiguous with the lower zone of the eastern lobe (Ivanic et al., in press). From the few examples thought to represent ultramafic zone material at the surface (e.g. Muleryon Hill, Zone 50, MGA 636080E 6833448N, adjacent to the contiguous Windimurra Igneous Complex), olivine pyroxenite with lesser peridotite and dunite with locally abundant disseminated chromite is present; in addition there are minor gabbroic rocks interlayered with ultramafic rocks on a decametre scale.   The lower zones of the igneous complexes primarily include gabbro to leucogabbro. Olivine gabbro-olivine gabbronorite-gabbronorite-norite locally represent the dominant rock types. Subordinate layers of peridotite, pyroxenite, anorthosite or troctolite are also present. The lower zones contain more abundant layers of ultramafic rocks than middle or upper zones, which largely comprise intercumulus-, or cumulus-magnetite(Â± ilmenite)-bearing gabbro, leucogabbro, gabbronorite, anorthosite, troctolite and dunite.  Discordant layering features in the Meeline Suite are notably present in the Windimurra and Youanmi Igneous Complexes. In these two complexes, igneous layering becomes shallower towards their tops as a result of their bowl-shaped (or inverted cone-shaped) overall vessel form. Most complexes show examples of small-scale angular discordances (or minor igneous unconformities). The Windimurra Igneous Complex hosts the widest array of these structures, for example the decametre-scale erosional channel structures (e.g. at the base of the upper zone magnetitites of the western lobe, TJIWIN000424, Zone 50, MGA 647409E 6867180N) and depositional features such as 'boulder horizons' (Ahmat, 1986). The largest example of discordance is in the 'Shephards Discordant Zone' of the Windimurra Igneous Complex where several kilometres of mineral-stratigraphic offset occurs, dividing the complex into eastern and western lobes (Ivanic and Brett, 2015).  This suite is nearly entirely anhydrous and it is distinguished from the younger Boodanoo Suite by having scarce-absent primary amphibole (Ivanic et al., 2010). The only observed primary amphibole occurs in a single layer of the upper part of the Youanmi Igneous Complex (TJIYOU100027, Zone 50, MGA 668131E 6830687N). The Meeline Suite is characteristically iron-rich in the more evolved zones of the complexes. These upper zones all host abundant magnetitite, the lowermost of which are the targets for vanadium exploration and mining. Trace element profiles are distinctly flat and only slightly elevated above primitive mantle values. At Windimurra there is indication of a slight depletion of light rare earth elements (Van Kranendonk et al., 2013).  All complexes in this suite recorded variable metamorphic overprint, mainly under greenschist-amphibolite facies conditions. Proximity to shear zones and granitic bodies is correlated to the degree of recrystallization and hydration of the nominally anhydrous gabbroic and ultramafic rocks. Metamorphic assemblages typically include chloriteÂ±talcÂ±serpentineÂ±actinoliteÂ±tremoliteÂ±magnetite and hornblendeÂ±epidoteÂ±actinoliteÂ±magnetiteÂ±titanite.",,,11000,,"The Meeline Suite is in contact with host rocks of the Norie Group. The roof zone of the Windimurra Igneous Complex likely represents the chilled upper contact with the Kantie Murdanna Volcanics Member (A-NOyk-xfr-cib). For example, at site TJIWIN090427 (Zone 50, MGA 645322E 6886149N) a harrisitic gabbro of the Windimurra Igneous Complex is in contact with a feldspar-phyric rhyo-dacite of the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member. The border zone of the Youanmi Igneous Complex has been the focus of Cu-Pb-Zn exploration since it has been a site of significant hydrothermal activity. For example, at site TJIYOU100071 (Zone 50, MGA 664341E 6817887N) the border zone dolerites of the Youanmi Igneous Complex have copper mineralization at their contact with quartzite and banded iron formation of the Youangarra Volcanics Member .  There are many examples of younger rock units cross-cutting the Meeline Suite. Granitic rocks (currently undated and assigned to the Mount Kenneth Suite) intrude into the northern part of the Windimurra Igneous Complex (e.g. at site TJIWIN090453, Zone 50, MGA 646680E 6905407N). These may be contemporaneous with the development of the roof zone of the complex and/or deposition of parts of the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member. The Big Bell and Tuckanarra Suite metamonzogranites are in sheared contact with parts of the Windimurra, Youanmi, Atley, Barrambie and Lady Alma Igneous Complexes, truncating many of the igneous layers on aeromagnetic maps. These layers are locally deformed into parallelism with shear zones and metamonzogranites, e.g. the Challa Shear Zone.   In addition, post-tectonic Walganna Suite granites (e.g. the Walgoo Monzogranite, A-BRwa-gm) intrude across the southern part of the Windimurra Igneous Complex and the western part of the Youanmi Igneous Complex, where they are interpreted to have cut across layering of the complexes and also across local shear zones. Here the contact zones within the complexes are inundated with Li-rich pegmatites, which crosscut layers of the lower zone of the Windimurra Igneous Complex (e.g. at site TJIWIN090040, Zone 50, MGA 652796E 6844034N) and also the border zone of the Youanmi Igneous Complex (at site TJIYOU100074, Zone 50, MGA 663693E 6818485N).",,17,,,Mixed,9,,,,2825,,2813,,"Gabbroic rocks from the Meeline Suite have yielded very few zircons. The only directly-dated rock is from one late-stage pegmatite from the Windimurra Igneous Complex which yielded an age of 2813 Â± 3 Ma (GSWA 194747, Wingate et al., 2012a). This is thought to represent the crystallization age of the Windimurra Igneous Complex and also provides an age estimate of the suite as a whole. Other ages either have a large error or are interpreted as being the result of Norie Group xenocrystic zircon populations (Ivanic et al., 2010).   At 2813 Â± 3 (GSWA 169003: Nelson, 2001a) Ma the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member provides a maximum age constraint for the Windimurra Igneous Complex since they are thought to represent roof pendants to the complex. These volcanics are thought to have been erupted during the intrusion of the Windimurra Igneous Complex, located just above its roof zone. Similarly, adjacent to the Youanmi Igneous Complex, felsic volcanic rocks of the Youangarra Volcanics Member have been dated at 2814 Â± 14 (GSWA 169067: Nelson, 2001b). These volcanic rocks likely crystallized within error of the age of intrusion of the Youanmi Igneous Complex (2819 Â±10 Ma; Gill, 2011).  Single populations of xenocrystic zircons from the igneous complexes of the Meeline Suite provide additional maximum age constraints. The Lady Alma Igneous Complex yields a zircon population dated at 2821 Â± 5 Ma (Wang, 1998), the Youanmi Igneous Complex again yields 2825 Â± 7 Ma (GSWA 194751; Wingate et al. 2012b), the Windimurra Igneous Complex yields 2802 Â± 19 Ma (GSWA 194749; Wingate et al., 2012c). These zircon populations have ages that are either within error or a few million years older than crystallization ages inferred for these igneous complexes. They are thought to represent the ages of felsic volcanic host rocks of the Norie Group, possibly within the Yaloginda Formation.  Crosscutting granitic rocks of the Mount Kenneth Suite have been dated adjacent to but not specifically cross-cutting the Youanmi Igneous Complex (Courlbarloo Tonalite 2813 Â± 5 Ma; Fletcher and McNaughton, 2002). Other younger crosscutting granitic rocks of the Tuckanarra Suite have also been dated in the region, the oldest of which is 2668 Â± 8 Ma (Wang, 1998). This unit crosscuts the Windimurra Igneous Complex to the west and a large dated pluton of the Big Bell Suite crosscuts it to the north (2729 Â± 9 Ma, GSWA 155511, Wingate et al., 2014). In the absence of younger ages or age constraints, the total duration of the Meeline Suite is thought to have been approximately 1 Ma, the result of a short lived but voluminous mantle plume (Ivanic et al., 2010), and is consistent with other short-lived but very voluminous systems such as the Bushveld (Zeh et al., 2015).",No,,,33,,No,Submitted,Yes,No,A,ANM,,,,,MIGSDTI,2.02E+13,,No,No

3213,78757,A-GIm-xfr-b,3212,Melita Formation,1,"Rhyolitic to dacitic rocks interleaved with basalt, basaltic andesite, dolerite and gabbro; metamorphosed","The Melita Formation, in the central western part of the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane in the Yilgarn Craton, is a c. 2683 Ma (Brown et al., 2002), bimodal (rhyolite-basalt) volcanic succession that outcrops mainly south-southeast of the town of Leonora on MELITA. It is interpreted here as part of the Gindalbie Group (A-GI-xf-b), a 2694-2676 Ma (Kositcin et al., 2008) volcanic association of bimodal (basalt-rhyolite) and calc-alkaline (intermediate to silicic) volcanic successions from several discrete volcanic centres. The rhyolitic components of the Melita Formation are among the best preserved felsic eruption centres in the Eastern Goldfields. They are interpreted as products of shallow subaqueous eruptions (Hallberg, 1985; Brown et al., 2002).  The felsic volcanic rocks of the Melita Formation are high-silica rhyolites and dacites that are enriched in incompatible elements, particularly high field strength elements (HFSE), compared to the other felsic associations in the eastern Yilgarn Craton (Brown et al., 2002).   Melita Formation felsic rocks are interleaved with mafic extrusive and intrusive rocks including lavas, shallow sills, including gabbros and minor amounts of ultramafic rocks interpreted as the bases of differentiated mafic sills (Witt, 1994). This package is interpreted as tholeiitic with trace-element concentrations similar to modern arc tholeiites (Brown et al., 2002). The geochemistry and volcanology of the Melita Formation is interpreted as similar to that generated by modern intra-arc or arc-rift settings, leading to the interpretation of the Melita Formation as representing the initial stages of back-arc rifting within a complex convergent margin (Brown et al., 2002). Barnes and Van Kranendonk (2014) have interpreted rocks of the Gindalbie Group as products of plume-crust interaction.  All rocks have undergone at least low-grade metamorphism.","The best outcrops of the Melita Formation are east of the Goldfields Highway in an area approximately 25 km south-southeast of the town of Leonora. The formation is mapped on MELITA, with extensions to the east, north and south that are poorly exposed and not well documented. Distal felsic pyroclastic deposits have been mapped on LEONORA and YERILLA, both approximately 35 km from the proposed Melita volcanic centre in northeastern MELITA. Also, in southeastern LEONORA, some felsic and mafic schists have been assigned to the Melita Formation, partly on the basis of a c. 2681 Ma SHRIMP U-Pb zircon on schist from a diamond drillhole (Baggott, 2006). However, there are insufficient data to demonstrate whether all these rocks are part of the Melita Formation, or were sourced from another volcanic centre.  Witt (1994) proposed that the Melita Formation volcanic rocks constitute an erupted volume of 900 km 3 , with an unfolded stratigraphic thickness of at least 700 m. However, Brown et al. (2002) estimated the stratigraphic thickness of the felsic volcanic components of the Melita Formation at 3 km. Gabbro and dolerite sills are estimated to constitute up to one third of the rock volume in the formation (Brown et al., 2002).  Brown et al. (2002) described the lower part of the Melita succession as dominated by pillowed to massive basalt lavas and mafic hyaloclastites, and the upper 1 to 1.5 km as dominated by subaqueously resedimented volcaniclastic sandstones and breccias, and rhyolite flows and sills. Brown et al. (2002) also summarized the spatial distribution of the volcanic facies within the Melita Formation, arguing that thick volcaniclastic units, breccias and minor rhyolitic and basaltic lavas dominate in the northeast of the MELITA area, and that volcanic and sedimentary rocks coarsen to the east. The proportion of felsic lava increases towards the east (Brown et al., 2002). Volcaniclastic units were described by Brown et al. (2002) as rare in the Hawk Well (Zone 51, MGA 345060E 6775630N) area, where basaltic andesite lavas and mafic sills are the most common rock types. However, particularly west of Hawk Well, thin layers of bedded volcaniclastic to reworked sediments can be used to trace bedding around the map-scale fold in this area (NLPEYS120059, Zone 51 MGA 341866E 6775490N). Brown et al. (2002) also described the typical along-strike variations in volcanic facies within the Melita Formation.  Hallberg (1985) suggested that the presence of clast-supported, proximal breccias in northeastern MELITA indicates that this is the main eruptive centre for the Melita volcanic rocks. The Melita Formation was originally defined as including two discrete volcanic centres: the Melita rhyolite and Jeedamya porphyry of the Melita Complex of Hallberg (1985) &mdash; also known as the Melita Rhyolite centre and Jeedamya porphyry pluton (Witt, 1994). This may be the case but, as there are very few data from the Jeedamya area and the two areas have geochemically similar rocks (e.g. similar REE patterns), the Melita and Jeedamya rocks are not separated into different formations in the current interpretation.","The Melita Formation is named after Melita homestead, located at Zone 51, MGA 348900E 6784910N. Brown et al. (2002) have described a traverse through the Melita Formation (between Zone 51, MGA 351220E 6779500N and Zone 51, MGA 353685E and 6781385N) that includes most of the major rock types exposed in the Melita Formation. This traverse is taken to be the type section for the formation. A well-exposed section along the traverse (between Zone 51, MGA 352157E 6779684N and Zone 51, MGA 352102E and 6780548N) shows mafic rocks interbedded with a variety of volcaniclastic rocks (Brown et al., 2001) and good examples of lava breccias, and volcaniclastic sandstone which are present near the eastern end of the traverse at Zone 51, MGA 353437E 6781583N (Brown et al., 2001).",,"It is not possible to represent the range of lithological variation present in the Melita Formation at 1:100 000 scale as individual layers of felsic and mafic rock types range in thickness from a few tens of centimetres to over 200 m (Brown et al., 2002). Individual units in the current GSWA interpretation represent the dominant lithology in each area, although mixed rock types are present almost everywhere. Map units A-GIm-fr, A-GIm-bb, A-GIm-bd and A-GIm-frp represent the coherent rhyolitic lava, mafic lava, basaltic andesite lava and rhyolitic porphyritic rocks, respectively. Map units A-GIm-frv and A-GIm-frx are units dominated by rhyolitic fine-grained distal and coarse-grained proximal breccias, respectively. All rocks have undergone at least low-grade metamorphism.  Areas dominated by medium- to coarse-grained, mafic intrusions are identified by the code A-GIm-od and the ultramafic bases of differentiated mafic intrusions are shown as A-GIm-up. Dolerite and quartz dolerite are locally significant components of the layered sills (Witt, 1994) in the Hawk Well (Zone 51, MGA 345060E 6775630N) and Mount Melita (Zone 51, MGA 333570E 6724450N) areas and north of Heron Well (Zone 51, MGA 342320E 6779990N). Representative photographs of outcrops and petrographic thin sections for rocks of the Melita Formation can be viewed in the WAROX database for sites in the range NLPEYS120001-64 and NLPEYS130001-152.  Brown et al. (2002) published detailed stratigraphic sections for the Melita Formation and proposed four facies associations: a mafic to intermediate lava association; a re-sedimented felsic volcaniclastic association; a coherent rhyolite association; and a fine-grained sedimentary association. Mapped rhyolitic to dacitic rocks include lavas, rhyolitic ash tuff, lapilli tuff and pyroclastic breccia, clast-supported autobreccia, and fine- to medium-grained sills.   Rhyolitic to dacitic pyroclastic units are typically massive to poorly sorted, and are interpreted as subaqueously deposited pyroclastic flows (Witt, 1994). Other pyroclastic units are well-bedded, fine-grained ash deposits with rare lapilli. Clast compositions in the poorly sorted volcaniclastic rocks include basalt, rhyolite and chert (Brown et al., 2002). Vitric and crystal fragments are common but lithic fragments are only locally a significant component of the pyroclastic rocks (Witt, 1994). No eutaxitic textures demonstrating the presence of welded or ignimbritic subaerial pyroclastic deposits in the MELITA area are documented (Brown et al., 2002) but preserved pumice clasts and lapilli indicate subaerial explosive activity.   Intrusive rhyolitic to dacitic rocks include shallow sills and porphyries, which can be difficult to distinguish from lava and ash deposits when fine grained. The Dairy Monzogranite (A-_dm-gmb) and other small HFSE-enriched granite plutons near the historical Kookynie townsite in southeastern MELITA are similar in composition and age to the Melita Formation rhyolites and have been interpreted as coeval plutons (Hallberg, 1985; Champion and Sheraton, 1997; Brown et al., 2002).  Mapped mafic rock types include massive and pillowed lavas and associated hyaloclasite (some resedimented), pumice breccias, and numerous sills of varying grain size. Many basalts and dolerites appear to be conformable with layering in other rock types but intrusive contacts have also been documented (Witt, 1994).  Ultramafic rocks include coarse-grained pyroxenite and peridotite (Witt, 1994), which have been mapped at the base of layered mafic sills near Hawk Well (Zone 51, MGA 345060E 6775630N) and north of Heron Well (Zone 51, MGA 342320E 6779990N). Many mafic rock successions show modal layering, which Brown et al. (2001, 2002) interpreted as products of crystallization from tholeiitic magma.    Geochemistry   Melita felsic volcanic rocks are highly enriched in incompatible elements (particularly HFSE: Sc, Y, Th, U, Pb, Zr, Hf, Ti, Nb, and Ta). Concentrations of light rare earth elements (LREE) are up to 40 times average chondritic values, much higher than in other east Yilgarn felsic rocks (Brown et al., 2002). Both mafic and felsic lavas in the Melita area have relatively high &epsilon;Nd T  values (+1 to +3), interpreted as indicating fractionation from mantle-derived magmas with minimal involvement of older crust (Barley et al., 2002).  Analyses of samples collected in 2013-14 by GSWA (data available from GSWA GeoChem Extract database http://geochem.dmp.wa.gov.au/geochem/) found differences in the REE contents of some felsic rocks but that an overall weakly negative slope of REE patterns and distinct Eu depletions are characteristic of Melita Formation felsic rocks. Plots of yttrium (Y) against zirconium (Zr) may also provide a means of discriminating Melita felsic rocks as analysed samples have geochemical patterns that cluster in three groups on Zr/Y plots: &bull; Group 1: rhyolitic to dacitic rocks with the highest REE concentrations and smallest negative Eu anomalies. These rocks outcrop in the Heron Well area and to the northwest. This group has the highest Zr and Y contents (typically about 600 and 150 ppb, respectively) &bull; Group 2: rhyolitic to dacitic rocks with the lowest REE concentrations and strongest Eu depletion outcrop in the Jeedamya area. This group, which has the lowest Zr and Y contents (typically about 100 and 25 ppb, respectively), contains the most altered rocks within the Melita Formation Group 3: rhyolitic to dacitic rocks in northeastern and central MELITA have REE patterns between the other groups and have Zr and Y concentrations that are typically about 300 and 75 ppb, respectively.   Brown et. al. (2002) also proposed two geochemical groups for coherent Melita rhyolites. The  Type 1  rhyolites of Brown et al. (2002) are equivalent to Group 3 above. Their  Type 2  rhyolites (shallow sills) were mapped west of Melita homestead (Zone 51, MGA 348900E 6784910N) and in the Heron Well area, and were described as lower in SiO 2 , higher in Fe 2 O 3  and TiO 2 , and more enriched in most incompatible elements than  Type 1  rhyolites. Brown et al. (2002) suggested that the Melita rhyolites may have formed from high-volume (90%) fractionation of more mafic lava, by partial crustal melting, or by a combination of these processes. They proposed derivation from an intermediate to calk-alkaline source for their  Type 1  rhyolites, and a tholeiitic to intermediate source for their  Type 2  rhyolites.  Mafic and andesitic lavas are typically very altered, with silica contents that plot in the dacite or low-silica rhyolite fields (Brown et al., 2002), making interpreting the geochemistry of these rocks difficult. Brown et al. (2002) described the geochemistry of the mafic rocks as transitional between arc tholeiites and MORB-type basalts, and interpreted the basaltic to andesitic rocks as enriched in incompatible elements in a pattern similar to the Melita rhyolites.  ","The facies preserved within the Melita Formation, particularly the interpretation of pyroclastic sequences as poorly sorted subaqueous turbidites, indicates a shallow subaqueous eruptive setting (Hallberg, 1985). The depositional environment for the Melita Formation has been interpreted as a rift-basin margin setting (Witt, 1994), potentially an intra-arc or arc-rift formed during the initial stages of back-arc rifting within a convergent margin (Brown et al., 2002; Barley et al. 2008). The geochemistry of the mafic volcanic and intrusive rocks of this formation is comparable with that of modern arc tholeiites (Brown et al., 2002).  Barnes and Van Kranendonk (2014) proposed that the calc-alkaline successions of the Gindalbie Group could have been generated through plume-crust interaction rather than in a convergent margin setting. ",,,,"The Melita Formation is separated from the granites to the west of the Mount George Shear Zone by a mixed felsic and mafic schist unit (A-GI-xmws-mfs). The felsic schist component of this unit may be deformed rocks of the Melita Formation.

Only one small outcrop, in the northeast corner of the RAWLINSON 1:250 000 map sheet area, has been identified in Western Australia (WA).","The Mereenie Sandstone is widespread in the NT component of the Amadeus Basin, although it is absent along the southern margin, and has been eroded during the late Devonian in the far northeast. The maximum thickness of about 900 m is reached in the Gairdner Range in the central-north part of the basin (NT). The only known outcrop in WA lies in the sand dunes between Lake Hopkins and the NT border in the northeastern corner of the RAWLINSON 1:250 000 map sheet area, where the low 1 km-long exposure dipping 10 degrees north is only about 10 m thick (Wells et al., 1964; Forman, 1965).","The name 'Mareeno Bluff Series' was first used by Chewings (1894), while Madigan (1932) referred to 'Mareenie Sandstone', with the spelling being finally amended to Mereenie Sandstone by Prichard and Quinlan (1962). The name is derived from Mereenie Range in the NT (spelling on maps has changed over time). The type section is about 8 km west of the point where Ellery Creek cuts the formation in the MacDonnell Ranges, NT (Prichard and Quinlan, 1962; Edgoose, 2013). At this location the formation unconformably overlies the Stokes Siltstone, and is overlain by the Hermannsburg Sandstone.",,"Based on outcrops in the NT (see Edgoose, 2013) the Mereenie Sandstone is variably thinly- to thickly-bedded and comprises white to pale brown, fine- to medium-grained, very pure quartz sandstone. Grains are typically well rounded and well sorted. Weathered surfaces are often medium brown to orange-red. Cross-beds and ripples are common, and locally very large scale trough cross-beds up to 10 m thick are present in the upper part of the formation. Trace fossils are present locally in the Mereenie Sandstone, typically in the lower part, and include vertical burrows ( Skolithos ) up to 90 cm long (Edgoose, 2013). Gouramanis and McLoughlin (2016) report arthropod trackways ( Diplichnites ) and sub-horizontal burrows referable to  Beaconites  and  Taenidium  from near the base at Kings Canyon (central NT Amadeus Basin). The only known outcrop in WA is described as a white fine-grained quartz sandstone which dips northwards at 10 degrees (Wells et al., 1964).","The depositional environment of the Mereenie Sandstone is variable (Edgoose, 2013).

The metasedimentary rocks have a strike length of approximately 42 kilometres in a plunging syncline. The sandstones comprise abundant volcanic quartz minor feldspar fragments, and rock fragments in centimetre to metre thick beds with tabular to channel fill geometry. Beds are commonly massive, or contain structures such as cross-bedding and pebble lags. Polymicitic conglomerate beds are most common at the base of the 1800m plus thick unit and are characteristic of a fluvial environment. Clasts are dominated by well-rounded granite cobbles to pebbles in a clast-supported matrix that also includes clasts of dacite, metamafic and quartzofeldspathic schist. KrapeÅ¾ et al. (2000; 2008) interpret deposition by fluvial process across a braidplain in a fault-bounded basin during exhumation of the underlying basement. Alternatively, Squire et al. (2010) suggest the sandstones were a product of quartz-rich pyroclastic volcanism and rapid reworking in an emergent to submarine environment.   The unit unconformably overlies very fine-grained, sandstones to mudstones of the Black Flag Group. The angle of unconformity is very low at the regional scale, while at the outcrop scale the contact appears conformable. A maximum deposition age of 2664Â± 6 Ma is provided by KrapeÅ¾ et al. (2000). ","A narrow (6 km wide) elongate (42 km long) syncline extending from just north of West Kambalda (MGA zone 51, 364218E, 6552224N) southwards to the south southeastern shoreline of Lake Lefroy, in the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane. The best exposures are along the western shoreline of Lake Lefroy and Merougil Creek (MGA zone 51, 370037E, 6543329). A lateral equivalent of the Merougil Formation is considered to be the Navajo Sandstone (Squire et al. 2010).",Named after Merougil Creek.,,"The formation is dominated by coarse- to medium-grained, well sorted sandstones with abundant volcanic quartz. The base of the unit may comprise tabular, clast-supported polymictic conglomerates, but these form less than 5 percent of the formation (Squire et al., 2010).    The sandstones comprise angular volcanic quartz with minor feldspar, metasedimentary and volcanic rock fragments, and abundant metamorphic biotite. Bedding is commonly upwards fining and may contain a pebble lag. The geometry of the sandstones varies from tabular to channel fill, with sedimentary structures that include trough cross bedding, parallel-stratification, and rare planar cross-bedding.   Basal tabular-bedded, clast-supported conglomerates are well exposed on the western margin of Lake Lefroy (MGA zone 51 370471E, 6541970N). Sorting varies from poorly to moderate, with a maximum clast of 40 cm, averaging approximately 15-20 cm. Clast composition includes and chert, metamafic (basalt to dolerite), quartzofeldspathic schist, dacite and well-rounded cobbles to boulders of granite. Bedding is massive to diffusely graded, with thickness from decimetre to metre scale. Conglomerate beds maybe intercalated with thinly- to medium bedded sandstones. ","KrapeÅ¾ et al. (2008) interpret the geometry and architecture of the Merougil Formation sandstones and conglomerate (their Merougil Supersequence), to characterize deposition in a fault-bounded basin by fluvial processes across a braid-plain. Clast and sandstone composition is consistent with a local provenance within the Kalgoorlie terrane (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2008).   Where KrapeÅ¾ et al (2008) interpret the abundant quartz grains to be derived from the erosion of exhumed granites, Squire et al. (2010) identified the quartz as volcanic that was sourced from a large-volume quartz-rich pyroclastic eruption and was rapidly reworked prior to deposition in a subaqeuous environment. Furthermore, Squire and others (2010) suggest the present distribution of the Merougil Formation, with apparent confinement to narrow northwest-trending basins, is a preservation bias and that distribution was much wider at the time of deposition.

(2000) yielded mean ages of 2664 Â± 6 Ma and 2671 Â± 3 Ma, with younger 95 percentiles defining maximum depositional ages of 2685 and 2668 Ma , respectively. Simultaneous SHRIMP dating of the underlying Black Flag Group by KrapeÅ¾ et al. (2008), lead them to conclude that the Merougil Formation was younger than 2655 Ma.   Squire et al. (2010) sampled a sandstone unit from diamond core (drill hole GVD141) within the St Ives gold camp. The sandstone comprised volcanic quartz and minor feldspar crystal fragments, plutonic quartz and chert. A SHRIMP U-Pb age of 2663 Â± 2 Ma was returned, and the spread of ages from the 76 zircons analysed indicated a unimodal, detrital zircon population. The unimodal population was part of the evidence used by Squire et al (2010) for a large pyroclastic eruption as the source of the volcanic quartz-rich sandstones, contemporaneous with high-Ca granite magmatism (Champion and Cassidy, 2002). Squire et al. (2010) suggest rapid reworking following the eruptive phase, and deposition of the formation was between 2670-2658 Ma.

4101,27276,P_-TKkm-se,4100,Meteorite Bore Member,1,"Diamictite and minor siltstone and sandstone; clasts comprise sandstone, felsic volcanic rock, quartzite, chert, BIF and dolomite","The Meteorite Bore Member is a useful stratigraphic marker within the upper third of the Kungarra Formation on HARDEY and ROCKLEA, and consists of glacigenic diamictite, sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone, with minor local carbonate beds. As originally defined, it consists of a single glacigenic interval, between 300 and 500 m thick, but a second interval, the Calgra Member (P_-TKkg-sd), has since been identified approximately 500 m higher in the Kungarra Formation. The interval containing these two diamictite members records two cycles of glacio-eustatic sea level change. The Meteorite Bore Member has a maximum depositional age of c. 2420 Ma and is intruded by c. 2208 Ma dolerite sills.","The known distribution of the Meteorite Bore Member is restricted to the Hardey Syncline on HARDEY and ROCKLEA. Correlation of glacigenic facies outside of the Hardey Syncline with the Meteorite Bore Member is controversial because their stratigraphic position is within the upper Boolgeeda Iron Formation, as originally defined by Trendall and Blockley (1970). In the type area in the Hardey Syncline, the Meteorite Bore Member is thicker at the type locality on the southern limb (c. 500 m) than it is in the type section on the northern limb (c. 300 m). There are no diamictites known from the Turee Creek Group in the Turner or Turee Creek synclines, or from the thin succession southeast of Mount Maguire (Zone 50, MGA 576473E 7418996N).","The Meteorite Bore Member was first named and interpreted as a glacigenic deposit by Trendall (1976) from a prominent exposure about 1 km northeast of Meteorite Bore on ROCKLEA (Zone 50, MGA 504276E 7464582N). The type section (Trendall, 1979, 1981) is south of Horseshoe Creek on the northern limb of the Hardey Syncline on HARDEY (in the vicinity of Zone 50, MGA 486660E, 7473450N). More recently, stratigraphic sections representative of the name locality have been measured in a larger more extensive outcrop about 1.5 km northwest of Meteorite Bore (Martin, 1999; Van Kranendonk and Mazumder, 2015). A second diamictite horizon higher in the succession is not considered part of the Meteorite Bore Member (Martin and Morris, 2010), and it is here named the Calgra Member, although it is part of an overall glacigenic interval consisting of two glacio-eustatic cycles (Van Kranendonk and Mazumder, 2015; Van Kranendonk et al., 2015).",,"The Meteorite Bore Member was originally defined as consisting of massive &ldquo;mixtite&rdquo; (Trendall, 1976) with a strong penetrative cleavage that obscures most primary depositional fabrics. The diagnostic feature of the unit was that it contained distinctive faceted and striated boulders, up to 50 cm long, which were interpreted to be of glacial origin. In defining the type section for the Meteorite Bore Member, Trendall (1979) did not present a measured section and described the type section as consisting of &ldquo;mixtite&rdquo;, albeit containing smaller clasts than those preserved at Meteorite Bore. Subsequent measured sections at both localities (Martin, 1999; Van Kranendonk and Mazumder, 2015) have recognised that the diamictites in both areas are interbedded with mudstone and fine-grained sandstone. In addition to the differences in average clast size, these studies have also recognised stratigraphic differences in the abundance of rhyolite, sandstone, carbonate, and granitic clasts. However, all localities in the Hardey Syncline are so intensely affected by the penetrative axial planar cleavage that diagnostic macroscopic glacigenic features, other than faceting and striation of clasts, has been obscured.  The largest clasts are composed of distinctive rhyolite that can be correlated with the Woongarra Rhyolite on the basis of textural features (Trendall, 1976, 1979, 1981; Martin, 1999) and detrital zircon ages (Martin, 1999; Takehara et al., 2010). BIF clasts are rare, and do not bear any resemblance to lithologies of the Hamersley Group, being pale in colour and iron-poor (R.C. Morris pers. comm. 1979 in Horwitz, 1980). Distinctive jaspilite clasts correlated with the Weeli Woli Formation of the Hamersley Group do not appear in the succession until the upper part of the Kazput Formation in sandstones and conglomerates that underlie the Anthiby Formation in the Hardey Syncline.","The Meteorite Bore Member is interpreted to have been deposited in open marine conditions during the first of two recognised glacio-eustatic sea level cycles within the Kungarra Formation that are characterised by the rapid onset of falling-stage systems tracts, followed by glacigenic deposition in a transgressive systems tract (Van Kranendonk and Mazumder, 2015). Facies associations in the Hardey Syncline suggest deposition in a distal setting with respect to the grounding line of marine glaciers, predominantly by submarine debris flows with probable additional contribution due to rain out from floating sea ice or icebergs (Martin, 1999). The decrease in clast size and overall unit thickness from south to north in the Hardey Syncline implies that this area was proximal to a rapidly melting ice front.",,,,The Meteorite Bore Member has sharp conformable upper and lower contacts with the parent Kungarra Formation.,,17,,,,5,,,,2420,,2208,,"The depositional age of the Meteorite Bore Member is poorly constrained by geochronology. The maximum possible age is given as the youngest reliable isotopic age obtained on the Woongarra Rhyolite, c. 2445 Ma (Trendall et al., 2004). The minimum age is c. 2208 Ma as constrained by the age of the Cheela Springs Basalt and associated Balgara Dolerite sills that intrude the Kungarra Formation (M&uuml;ller et al., 2005; Martin and Morris, 2010).

Part of the unit is interpreted as a recrystallized mylonitic metamonzogranite (P_-MOmi-mgmy) that was emplaced syntectonically with the Capricorn Orogeny. The protolith to the Middle Spring Granite was an equigranular or sparsely porphyritic monzogranite with about 5% thin tabular K-feldspar phenocrysts 5-10 mm long. The Middle Spring Granite contains inclusions of rock types similar to those observed in the Halfway Gneiss.","The Middle Spring Granite forms an easterly trending belt about 10 km wide and 50 km long south of Burringurrah Community on the eastern part of PINK HILLS and the adjacent western part of CANDOLLE. The granite forms low undulating country typically with good exposure comprising low outcrops and pavements. Exposure at both ends of the belt is commonly poor, as it is largely covered by sheetwash or partly consolidated colluvial deposits.","The Middle Spring Granite (Thorne et al., 2010) was named after Middle Spring, on the central-eastern part of PINK HILLS.",,"Most of the Middle Spring Granite comprises a fine-grained, gneissic metamonzogranite characterized by a 2-3 mm-thick gneissic banding or foliation. This fabric is parallel to the S 1n  gneissic layering or foliation in metasedimentary rocks of the Leake Spring Metamorphics. Most of the rocks are pale grey, and contain approximately 10% biotite or less as the only mafic mineral. Locally the rocks consist of augen gneiss. Pegmatite veins in within the foliation or banding are rare. This unit also contains narrow horizons of recrystallized mylonitic monzogranite (P_-MOmi-mgmy). Low-strain domains show that the protolith to the Middle Spring Granite was typically equigranular or sparsely porphyritic with about 5% thin tabular K-feldspar phenocrysts 5-10 mm long.  Most of the Middle Spring Granite is homogeneous, but locally (as at SXSPKH008176, 4.5 km northeast of Middle Spring) the metamonzogranite is heterogeneous, comprising banded and schlieric, inclusion-rich varieties. In this area, parts of the unit superficially have the appearance of a diatexite. Inclusions comprise foliated metamonzogranite and metatonalite, calc-silicate gneiss, biotite-rich mesocratic tonalitic gneiss, and rare amphibolite.

The host metamonzogranite truncates the gneissic banding in the raft.  The Middle Spring Granite is intruded by several granitic units of the Moorarie Supersuite, in particular by veins and dykes of variably porphyritic metamonzogranite of the Rubberoid Granite. Irregular veins of leucocratic granite with biotite clots up to 2 cm in diameter intrude the Middle Spring Granite at many localities, as do veins and thin dykes of muscovite-tourmaline granite and pegmatite (P_-DU-gmvt, P_-DU-gpt).

The quartz-feldspar-biotite rocks are derived from granitic protoliths that have magmatic ages of c. 2770 Ma and are cross cut by undeformed granite dykes at c. 2645 Ma. Intrusion of the granite protoliths was contemporaneous with deposition of lithic rich sandstone of the Palkapiti and Hanns Jasper Formations. ,"Orthogneisses of the Minigwal suite are located southeast of Laverton on the LIGHTFOOT and MINIGWAL 1:100,000 map sheets. Aeromagnetic data indicate that different formations of the suite are extensive, covering hundreds of square kilometres. However, this interpreted extent of the suite is in stark contrast to the crop outs which are few in number and limited to weathered breakaways, platforms near Lakes Lightfoot and Minigwal and small pavements within sandy regolith. ",,,"The Minigwal suite is characterized by metatextitic migmatites with granitic sheets that are sub-parallel to the foliation in the migmatite. The metatextite has pale blue-grey, medium-grained and a relatively equigranular palesome (quartz-feldspar-biotite), with continuous, centimetre-wide leucosomes aligned parallel to the foliation in the paleosome. The granite sheets are leucocratic, coarse-grained and equigranular and locally include folded mafic schlieren. The age and source of the granite sheets is unknown, but the orientation of the sheets, parallel to dominant the trend of metatexites suggests penecontemporaneous injection of deeper level melts at higher levels during migmatization. Petrographically the migmatites are composed of 70-80% quartz, 10-18% plagioclase, 2-3% microcline and 5-8% biotite. Subordinate minerals include magnetite, chlorite after biotite, zircon and epidote. // The suite has at least two solid state deformation fabrics and these fabrics are commonly cross cut by both sinistral and dextral shears (some locally melt-filled), late stage pegmatites, and undeformed c.2645 Ma granite dykes.

The group as a whole was deposited in coastal to inner shelf settings, between c. 1865 and ?1815 Ma. It is composed dominantly of fine-grained sandstone and siltstone, with a limestone and siltstone interval near the top. Stromatolitic limestone is common in parts of the Wongawol Formation, and a characteristic feature of the Kulele Limestone.","The Miningarra Group is preserved in the core of the east-plunging syncline that forms the bulk of the exposed Earaheedy Basin. The contact with the underlying Frere Formation is generally poorly exposed, and the depositional top of the group is not preserved - the highest strata are the eroded top of Mulgarra Sandstone, beneath Paleozoic or Cenozoic deposits.","The Miningarra Group was named and briefly defined, as Miningarra Subgroup, by Hall et al (1977). The name Miningarra Group was used, but not explained, by Purfahl et al. (2015) and Martin et al. (2015, 2016), in anticipation of the revised terminology set out here and by Occhipinti et al. (2017). The Tooloo and Miningarra Subgroups of the Earaheedy Group are here upgraded to group status (and the Earaheedy Group abandoned) following re-assessment of a discontinuous basal conglomerate at the base of the Miningarra Group on WONGAWOL. This is now thought to mark a significant hiatus, rather than simply to have formed as a marine hardground (Jones, 2004; Pirajno et al., 2004). Additional geochronological work, and re-assessment of earlier geochronological data by Halilovic et al. (2004), by Rasmussen et al. (2012) and Sheppard et al. (2016), and reassessement of tetonstratigraphic relationships and correllations by Occhipinti et al (2017) also suggest a hiatus between the Frere Formation and Miningarra Group of greater significance than previously thought by Bunting (1986) and Pirajno et al. (2009).  The group is named after Miningarra Creek, which drains north into Lake Carnegie on WINDIDDA, or Miningarra Pool, a pool on the creek.",,,,2500,3800,,,,17,,,Mixed,2,,,,1876,,1650,,"The age of the Miningarra Group is poorly constrained. Initial U-PB detrital zircon geochronology by Haliliovic et al. (2004) was reviewed and recalculated by Sheppard et al. (2016), who concluded that the only firm constraints were 1876+/- 19 Ma from a single grain in the Chiall Formation, and 1867 +/- 25 Ma from the Mulgarra Sandstone. They considered the detrital zircon age of 1808 +/- 36 Ma from the Mulgarra Sandstone by Halilovic et al. to be unreliable. The 1870 - 1860 Ma age component coincides with a hiatus in igneous activity elsewhere in the Capricorn Orogen (Sheppard et al., 2016), indicating an exotic source or multiple generations of zircon weathering.   The only minimum constraint is the age of metamorphic micas in dynamically metamorphosed Yelma Formation from the underlying Tooloo Group in central RHODES, c. 1650 Ma (Pirajno et al.

(2017) considered that the entire Miningarra Group was most likely older than c. 1820 Ma. They inferred that the 1815 Ma age of mineralization in the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite reported by Muhling et al. (2012) reflected fluid flow during deformation of the entire succession, rather than the passage of mineralizing fluids after deposition of the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite but before the overlying Frere Formation as inferred by Muhling et al. (2012). Occhipinti et al.

Outcrop of this suite lies entirely to the north of the Mann Fault, and is scattered widely throughout the southeastern part of BATES. The metamorphic mineralogy of the hornblende-garnet granodioritic augen gneiss reflects recrystallization at the high-pressure granulite facies, probably during the Petermann Orogeny. The protoliths to these rocks intruded between c. 1190 and c. 1155 Ma during the later part of the Musgrave Orogeny.","This hornblende-garnet granodioritic augen gneiss unit forms limited rubbly outcrop, approximately 4.5 km to the southeast of Mount Gosse, in the southeastern part of BATES (MGA 498667E 7137797N).",,,"This augen gneiss is locally mylonitic, incorporated into a zone of shearing between older quartzofeldspathic granulitic gneiss of the Wirku Metamorphics and structurally overlying granofels. It is typically a mesocratic, medium-grained (to very fine grained in ultramylonites) rock, with highly stretched K-feldspar augens that locally form up to 25% of the rock. It is interleaved with, intrudes, and contains inclusions of, quartzofeldspathic granulitic gneiss (Wirku Metamorphics), but shows only structural contact with the overlying granofels.  Sample GSWA 180283 (taken from this unit s type locality) is a medium-grained, K-feldspar porphyritic blastomylonite. Felsic domains are of granoblastic quartz and feldspar. Elongate domains of granoblastic polygonal feldspar represent original phenocrysts. Quartz ribbons are common. Mafic domains are 1 to 5 mm thick, highly elongate, and comprise granoblastic polygonal assemblages of garnet, clinopyroxene, and hornblende, with lesser amounts of biotite and opaque minerals. Polygonal grains of hornblende rim larger anhedral grains of clinopyroxene. Garnet is clear (inclusion-free) and pink in the groundmass or in coronas; however, large anhedral garnets also occur and typically comprise cores rich in quartz inclusions, surrounded by clear pink rims. The mylonitic fabric is early (early- to syn-metamorphic) and has been recrystallized, most likely at upper amphibolite facies, but the garnet cores (in porphyroblasts) provide evidence for a possible earlier metamorphic event.  In samples collected from elsewhere in the west Musgrave Province (e.g. GSWA 174716: BATES, MGA 474185E 7147627N), much of the mafic assemblage has been recrystallized to an assemblage comprising clinopyroxene, green hornblende, garnet, and biotite, although large cores of clinopyroxene are also preserved and possibly represent primary minerals. Textures are typically granoblastic elongate, indicating post-mylonitic recrystallization to blastomylonite, most likely at upper amphibolite facies. Garnets form distinct porphyroblasts, which are up to 5 mm in size, with cores crowded with inclusions of quartz, biotite, and ?feldspar, surrounded by inclusionfree rims. These mylonitic rocks provide evidence for two phases of, or at least protracted, garnet growth.  Regionally, the hornblende-garnet granodioritic augen gneiss unit varies in terms of the proportions of interleaves and inclusions within quartzofeldspathic granulitic gneiss. These interleaves and inclusions are locally abundant in the vicinity of the type locality, but are rare in outcrops to the west of Mount Daisy Bates (e.g. around BATES, MGA 474185E 7147627N).",,,,,,,8,,,,4,,,,1183,,1176,,"Rocks of the Mirturtu Suite form part of the late Pitjantjatjara Supersuite (Smithies et al., 2009, 2010).

Outcrops south of the King Leopold Ranges on the CHARNLEY 1:250 000 map sheet are characterized by the presence of abundant, well-formed, bipyramidal phenocrysts of quartz, 2-3 mm wide. Quartz can form up to 30% of the surface area of some Mondooma Granite outcrops. K-feldspar (microcline-microperthite) and plagioclase phenocrysts are less obvious than quartz forming subhedral to anhedral crystals 0.2-1.0 cm long, found individually or in bands and patches (Gellatly et al., 1969). Both feldspars are zoned. Andesine (An 30 -An 70 ) is the most abundant phenocryst-forming mineral with subhedral to anhedral crystals 0.6-5.0 mm long (Gellatly et al., 1969). Biotite is found in clots of fine-grained flakes. Laths of green amphibole (possibly actinolite) and associated hornblende are found in 3 mm long crystals, possibly altered from orthopyroxene (which is subordinate in the groundmass). Orthopyroxene (or other mafic minerals) pseudomorphs are present (Gellatly and Halligan, 1971). Accessory minerals include zircon and apatite.  Xenoliths of the highly porphyritic Mount Disaster Porphyry have been found in various stages of assimilation on CHARNLEY (Gellatly and Halligan, 1971). Gellatly et al. (1969) noted that &ldquo;these xenoltithic remnants are from 10 cm to 1 m long, and contain anhedral to euhdral alkali feldspar phenocrysts from 1 cm to 4 cm long, and locally ovoid phenocrysts up to 3 cm across. Contacts between these xenoliths and host rocks are sharp to gradational, and some xenoliths are partly resorbed. Many of the large discrete potash feldspar phenocrysts in Mondooma Granite may in fact be xenocrysts derived by partial resorption of these xenoliths&rdquo;. ","The Mondooma Granite is a high-level intrusion of the Paperbark Supersuite which has probably undergone rapid magma-phenocryst equilibrium (Gellatly et al., 1969). It is considered a subvolcanic equivalent of the Whitewater Volcanics (Tyler and Griffin, 1993; Griffin et al., 1993) with some of the Mondooma Granite resembling crystal-rich phases of the Whitewater Volcanics (Gellatly et al., 1969).

These units are intercalated with minor calc-silicate gneiss (P_-MG-mkq) and marble (P_-MG-mkk). The units occur within the Paradise, Mooloo, and Mutherbukin Zones at the southern end of the Gascoyne Province as three linear belts intercalated and interfolded with basement gneisses of the Halfway Gneiss. The precursor sediments were deposited sometime between c. 2240  and c. 2125 Ma, as a result of uplift during the Ophthalmia Orogeny to the north, and were sourced directly from the underlying Halfway Gneiss, as well as from lithologies along the southern Pilbara margin.","The Moogie Metamorphics are distributed within the Paradise, Mooloo, and Mutherbukin zones as three main west-east to northwest-southeast trending belts comprising mainly schistose rocks of the Mumba Psammite (P_-MGm-mtsf). The southerly belt forms a 30 km-long series of outcrops on DAURIE CREEK and GLENBURGH, centred on and around Mount Dalgety. The central belt is roughly 40 km long and straddles the southern parts of LOCKIER, YINNETHARRA, and the northern parts of DAURIE CREEK and GLENBURGH, whereas the northern belt forms a discontinuous train of outcrops some 150 km long on the northern parts of LOCKIER, YINNETHARRA, and central and southern parts of PINK HILLS and CANDOLLE. Thin, disparate lenses and rafts of quartzite (P_-MGm-mtq) are tectonically intercalated with leucocratic Halfway Gneiss and porphyritic granitic gneisses of the Durlacher Supersuite on the southern part of MOUNT SANDIMAN.   Intermittent, decimetre-scale outcrops of calc-silicate gneiss, amphibolite, metagabbro, marble, and ultramafic schist are found within and between these schist belts where they are interleaved and folded with gneissic rocks of the Halfway Gneiss, and deformed meta-igneous rocks of the Moorarie Supersuite.","Metasedimentary rocks of the Moogie Metamorphics were previously included within the Morrissey Metamorphic Suite (Williams et al., 1983a; Williams, 1986), the name given to a suite of metamorphosed and deformed Proterozoic sedimentary rocks thought to outcrop throughout the Gascoyne Province (Williams et al., 1983b). The suite was considered to be equivalent, in part, to sedimentary rocks of the Wyloo Group to the north, and sedimentary rocks of the Yerrida and Bryah Groups (Pirajno et al., 1998) to the east. However, it is now clear that all the metasedimentary rocks throughout the Gascoyne Province were not deposited in the same sedimentary basin, nor are they all the same age. The Moogie Metamorphics on GLENBURGH, DAURIE CREEK, LOCKIER, MOUNT SANDIMAN, YINNETHARRA, PINKS HILLS, and CANDOLLE are separated from the Morrissey Metamorphic Suite, as defined on the GLENBURGH 1:100 000 sheet (Occhipinti and Sheppard., 2001), by large areas of granitic gneiss, supracrustal metasedimentary and mafic meta-igneous rocks, and large fault structures.   The Moogie Metamorphics were named after Moogie Well in the western part of GLENBURGH.",,"The Moogie Metamorphics comprise mainly a series of psammitic schists known as the Mumba Psammite (P_-MGm-mtsf). This unit not only contains abundant psammitic schist (P_-MGm-mtsf), but also pelitic schist (P_-MGm-mls), and quartzite (P_-MGm-mtq). Minor lithologies within the Moogie Metamorphics are calc-silicate gneiss (P_-MG-mkq) and associated marble (P_-MG-mkk).  The Mumba Psammite is dominated by medium- to coarse-grained, feldspathic psammitic schist, but discrete belts of pelitic schist and massive recrystallized quartzite are common. Most of the lithologies have been metamorphosed at medium to high grade during the 2005-1950 Ma Glenburgh Orogeny, with the pelitic lithologies undergoing melting and migmatization. However, all of the peak metamorphic assemblages, including key metamorphic porphyroblasts such as garnet and sillimanite, have been retrogressed during subsequent deformation and metamorphism.  Calc-silicate gneiss (P_-MG-mkq) and associated marble (P_-MG-mkk) are minor, but widespread rock types within the Paradise, Mooloo, and Limejuice Zones. The units commonly have a fine-scale compositional layering defined by alternations of amphibole- or diopside-rich and quartz-rich layers.",,,,,"The Mumba Psammite forms three sub-parallel, east-west to northwest-southeast trending belts, each of which is some 3-10 km wide and with strike lengths of greater than 50 km. The contacts with other rock units are rarely exposed. It is interpreted that most contacts with the underlying Halfway Gneiss are tectonic, although in rare, low-strain pockets on the southern part of YINNETHARRA (SPHYIN000220), the Mumba Psammite is observed to rest unconformably on the Halfway Gneiss. This interpretation is supported by a detrital zircon geochronological study, which indicates that the Mumba Psammite was sourced, in part, directly by the erosion of the Halfway Gneiss (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011). On southern YINNETHARRA, the psammitic schists are intruded by numerous sub-parallel sheets of leucocratic metamonzogranite to pegmatite (P_-MO-gmvl) of the Moorarie Supersuite, and on PINKS HILLS the psammitic schists are in tectonic contact with numerous rocks of the Moorarie Supersuite, Durlacher Supersuite, and Edmund Group.  The minor lithologies generally form disparate infolds within the Mumba Psammite or, more commonly, as folded imbricates within the Halfway Gneiss. In the northern part of GLENBURGH and on southern and central YINNETHARRA, lenses of calc-silicate gneiss and marble appear to be faulted against the Halfway Gneiss and contain a moderate to well-developed gneissic layering that is folded with the Halfway Gneiss. On GLENBURGH, in the vicinity of Hectors Bore and Middle Well, the calcsilicate gneiss and marble are locally intruded by granites of the Moorarie Supersuite. In the southeastern part of GLENBURGH, several rafts of calc-silicate gneiss are present in foliated and gneissic granite of the Nardoo Granite.",,17,,,Mixed,2,,,,2240,8,2125,5,"Detrital zircon and metamorphic zircon and monazite from nine samples of the Mumba Psammite have been dated using SHRIMP U-Pb methods. The psammitic schists were collected from the Paradise, Mooloo, and Mutherbukin Zones. Samples GSWA 183275, 184160, 184161, 190651, and 187403 (Kirkland et al., 2009a,b; Wingate et al., 2010a,b, 2011), and NP20 (Kinny et al., 2004), were collected for detrital zircon geochronology and samples GSWA 164333, 164369, and 168713 (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011) were collected for in situ monazite dating.  The detrital zircon age spectra from all samples are similar, with abundant dates in the 2800-2300 Ma range, together with minor older and slightly younger age components. The youngest detrital zircons in all samples are similar in age, with the youngest grain present in GSWA 184160 dated at 2239 Â± 16 Ma (Johnson et al., 2011). The next three youngest grains from two other samples (GSWA 187403 and NP20) provide a more robust maximum age of deposition of c. 2280 Ma. Additionally, sample GSWA 164369 contains partially recrystallized monazite with cores of probable metamorphic origin and discrete metamorphic zircon grains dated at c. 2125 Ma. This date is taken to represent the age of metamorphism of the psammitic schist during a currently unknown tectonic event. This also provides a minimum age for deposition of the protolith.  Abundant metamorphic zircon rims and monazite are present within all dated samples. The range of dates for this metamorphic event are mainly constrained between 1965 and 1950 Ma and represent the age of high-grade metamorphism and migmatization that affected most of the Moogie Metamorphics during the D 2g  event of the collision-related Glenburgh Orogeny. In addition, younger metamorphic rims with ages of c. 1770 and c. 1790 Ma (samples GSWA 187403 and 184160, respectively) are interpreted to date low- to medium-grade overprinting during the intracontinental Capricorn Orogeny, presumably during the D 2n  event. No samples of the minor lithologies (calc-silicate rock or marble) have been dated directly, although their field relationships suggest that they are an integral part of the Moogie Metamorphics and have similar depositional ages and settings.  Based on the ages of both detrital zircons and metamorphic events, this package is interpreted to have been deposited between 2240 and 2125 Ma, possibly as a result of uplift during the Ophthalmia Orogeny (Johnson et al., 2010), and was affected by high-grade metamorphism at 1965-1950 Ma during the Glenburgh Orogeny, and subsequent low-grade overprinting during the intracontinental Capricorn Orogeny at c. 1780 Ma (Johnson et al., 2010).",No,,,13,c,No,Published,Yes,Yes,P_,MG,,13,33,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,No,No

The formation has a conformable lower contact with the Bywash Formation and an unconformable upper contact with the Edmund Group. The stratigraphy consists of fine- to very coarse-grained sandstone, siltstone, conglomerate, dolostone, dolomitic siltstone, and felsic volcaniclastic sandstone. These rocks are interpreted as an assemblage of predominantly shallow-marine (or lacustrine), braided fluvial, and fan-delta deposits that were laid down in a rapidly subsiding basin, located to the north of a tectonically active upland area in the central part of the Capricorn Orogen. The age of the Mooline Formation is uncertain, but it was probably deposited between c. 1799 and 1738 Ma.","The Mooline Formation is confined to the Capricorn Range on CAPRICORN and ASHBURTON. Attempts to determine the thickness of the Mooline Formation are made difficult by the nature of Ashburton Fold Belt D 2a  and D 3a  faulting and folding. Estimates range from about 1100 m in the area south of Koonong Pool (Zone 50, MGA 492800E 7416700N) to about 2500 m in the western Capricorn Range (Zone 50, MGA 464628E 7419600N).","The Mooline Formation was established by Martin et al. (2005) as a result of their mapping on the EDMUND 1:250 000 map sheet. It forms the upper part of the Capricorn Group and is named after Mooline Bore (Zone 50, MGA 469310E 7437720N) on central CAPRICORN. A representative section of the Mooline Formation is exposed in the type section for the Capricorn Group in Stockyard Creek (Zone 50, MGA 487880E 7414580N).",,"The Mooline Formation is composed of fine- to very coarse-grained sandstone, siltstone, conglomerate, dolostone, dolomitic siltstone, and felsic volcaniclastic sandstone. More significant thicknesses of siltstone, mixed dolostone and sandstone, and conglomerate have been mapped as separate members of the formation (P_-CPm-sf, P_-CPm-kt, P_-CPm-sc). The Mooline Formation is generally resistant to weathering and erosion, and outcrops as a series of prominent ridges and low hills.  Fine- to very coarse-grained sandstones are commonly micaceous or dolomitic and are often interbedded with variable amounts of siltstone. Fine- to medium-grained quartz sandstones or lithic quartz sandstones are thin- to medium-bedded and display a range of internal structures including parallel-planar lamination, low-angle planar cross-lamination, undulatory lamination, and ripple cross-lamination. Linsen- or flaser-laminated, fine-grained sandstone beds are locally associated with mixed sandstone and siltstone units. Medium- to very coarse-grained or pebbly lithic sandstones and quartz sandstones form medium- to very thick-bedded tabular to lenticular units. Internal structure is dominated by stacked sets of medium- to large-scale trough or planar tabular cross-stratification, interlayered with parallel-planar or undulatory stratification. Symmetrical straight-crested ripples and linguoid ripple bedforms are also preserved. Trough cross-stratification axes generally record a broad, northward paleocurrent flow. Soft-sediment deformation, in the form of ball-and-pillow structures or convolute lamination, may modify the primary internal structure. Petrographically the lithic sandstones are poorly sorted and contain a diverse suite of rock fragments including sedimentary and metasedimentary rock, altered felsic volcanic rock, and chlorite-rich rock. Single crystal quartz grains may form a relatively minor (20-25%) component of the rock and many are derived from a felsic volcanic source. Accessory minerals include disseminated, ragged limonite and leucoxene, and rare grains of tourmaline and fractured zircon.  Thin beds and laminae of felsic volcaniclastic sandstone are interlayered with non-volcanic sandstone and siltstone units within the Mooline Formation. The thickest volcaniclastic sandstone bed is 1.2 m thick and is characterized by a massive internal structure. Thinner beds consist of fine- to medium-grained felsic volcaniclastic sandstone and display parallel-planar or undulatory lamination or ripple cross-lamination.  Siltstones and dolomitic siltstones are parallel-planar laminated or ripple cross-laminated. Dolostones are strongly recrystallized and form lenticular, thinly to thickly bedded layers. They are generally composed of dolarenite or granule- to pebble-dolorudite and their internal structure is massive to irregularly stratified. Pseudocolumnar and domical stromatolites, up to 10 cm across, are preserved locally. Lenticular beds of massive to weakly stratified polymictic, granule- to cobble-conglomerate are interbedded with sandstone in the upper part of the Mooline Formation. Clasts are poorly sorted, subangular to rounded, and consist mostly of quartz sandstone, vein quartz, silicified siltstone, jaspilite, and dolostone (dolarenite and dololutite).  ","Thorne and Seymour (1991) interpret the middle to upper part of the Capricorn Group, including the Mooline Formation, as an assemblage of predominantly shallow-marine (or lacustrine) deposits. They were deposited in a rapidly subsiding basin, located to the north of a tectonically active upland area that occupied the central part of the Capricorn Orogen. In the latter stages of the basin s evolution, source-area uplift was accompanied by braided fluvial progradation. Finally, localized proximal fan-delta deposits, containing a high proportion of carbonate and felsic volcanic material were introduced from the south.",,2500,,The Mooline Formation has a conformable lower contact with the Bywash Formation and an unconformable upper contact with the Edmund Group.,,17,,,,4,,,,1799,,1738,,"The Mooline Formation was probably deposited between c. 1799 and 1738 Ma.  The youngest age component of detrital zircons in a coarse-grained lithic sandstone from the Mooline Formation gives this unit a maximum depositional age of 1801 Â± 14 Ma (GSWA 148925, Nelson, 2004a), although the youngest zircon is 1800 Â± 14 Ma (1&sigma;). This date is within uncertainty of felsic volcanic rocks within the Koonong Member (Hall et al., 2001; Wingate et al., 2107a,b) of the conformably underlying Bywash Formation as well as with deformed felsic rocks within the unconformably underlying Wyloo Group (Evans et al., 2003; Nelson, 2004b). Therefore, we here use the age of the youngest deformed rock in the underlying Wyloo Group, at c. 1799 Ma (Evans et al., 2003) to define both the base of the Capricorn Group and the maximum age of the Mooline Formation.   A conservative younger age limit for the Mooline Formation is fixed by the c. 1738 Ma age of gold mineralization at the Mount Olympus deposit (Sener et al., 2005) that post-dates the D 2n  event responsible for much of the deformation in the Capricorn Group.",No,,,1,,No,Published,No,No,P_,CPm,,,,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

The supersuite forms the Minnie Creek batholith in the centre of the Gascoyne Province, as well as plutons, dykes, and veins elsewhere. Although much of the granite in the western part of the Capricorn Orogen is now known to belong to younger and older supersuites, the Moorarie Supersuite still comprises a large volume of granite. The Moorarie Supersuite is dominated by granodiorite and monzogranite, and their metamorphosed equivalents, with a conspicuous paucity of coeval mafic rocks. The Minnie Creek batholith is notable for the presence of tonalite, quartz diorite, and some metagabbro.","Granitic rocks of the Moorarie Supersuite intruded across the Gascoyne Province and into adjacent tectonic units. The Minnie Creek batholith in the Limejuice Zone is composed entirely of granites of the Moorarie Supersuite. The batholith has an exposed length of more than 270 km and is about 30-50 km wide. The western and eastern ends of the batholith are unconformably overlain by younger sedimentary rocks. Substantial volumes of coeval granites were emplaced into the Boora Boora and Mooloo Zones in the northern and southern parts of the region, respectively (Occhipinti and Sheppard, 2001; Martin et al., 2005). Reworked granites of the Moorarie Supersuite form the basement to the Pooranoo Metamorphics in the Mangaroon Zone. Granites of the supersuite form plutons that intruded the Ashburton Fold Belt (KrapeÅ¾ and McNaughton, 1999); large amounts of granite and pegmatite of the Moorarie Supersuite also intruded the Yarlarweelor Gneiss Complex during the Capricorn Orogeny (Occhipinti et al., 1998; Sheppard et al., 2003).","The Moorarie Supersuite name is derived from the Moorarie Homestead on the homonymous 1:100 000 map sheet on which the supersuite was first mapped (Occhipinti and Myers, 1999).",,"In the Limejuice Zone the Minnie Creek batholith comprises biotite-bearing porphyritic monzogranite, granodiorite, and tonalite plutons, with minor quartz diorite and syenogranite. Igneous muscovite is a very minor component of some granites. Although igneous structures and textures are typically well preserved, many of the rocks have undergone low-grade static metamorphism. Hornblende-bearing granites are rare, and are mainly restricted to quartz diorites, where hornblende is intergrown with biotite. Some tonalites contain intergrowths of recrystallized biotite and epidote, with the shape of some intergrowths suggesting that they are pseudomorphed amphibole. The granites are medium and coarse grained, and range from equigranular to coarsely porphyritic. Many of the granodiorites and tonalites are equigranular to sparsely porphyritic, whereas many of the monzogranites contain up to 30% tabular or round microcline or microperthite phenocrysts that may reach 6 cm in length. Basic and intermediate rocks, including fragments of layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions, are scattered through the batholith as rafts. Some basic rocks have associated net-vein structures indicative of mafic-felsic magma mingling. Round to elliptical basic to intermediate inclusions in the granites are widespread, although not abundant.  In the Mutherbukin Zone, Moorarie Supersuite rocks comprise foliated to gneissic biotite(-muscovite) metamonzogranite, metagranodiorite, and metatonalite. Farther south in the Mooloo Zone, the Moorarie Supersuite forms several large, sheet-like plutons striking in an easterly direction, and associated dykes. These comprise medium-grained, equigranular biotite(-tourmaline- muscovite) monzogranite and biotite(-muscovite) monzogranite, and porphyritic, fine- to medium-grained biotite metagranodiorite (Occhipinti and Sheppard, 2001).  In the Boora Boora Zone, granites of the supersuite are foliated and gneissic granodiorite, with subordinate tonalite and monzogranite. Low-strain areas show the rocks to contain primary biotite, or biotite and minor muscovite; there is no evidence for igneous hornblende. In the Mangaroon Zone, exposure of the Moorarie Supersuite is restricted to rafts or inliers of biotite monzogranite and granodiorite gneiss (Gooche Gneiss; Martin et al., 2005).  In the Yarlarweelor Gneiss Complex (the reworked northern margin of the Yilgarn Craton) Moorarie Supersuite rocks comprise sheets, dykes, and veins. The rock types include coarse-grained to very coarse grained, leucocratic biotite granodiorite, monzogranite, and syenogranite; biotite(-muscovite) pegmatite; and medium grained, equigranular to moderately porphyritic biotite granodiorite, monzogranite, and leucocratic tonalite (Sheppard et al., 2003). Mafic rocks are conspicuously absent.",,,,,"The Moorarie Supersuite intrudes a wide range of units. Over a large part of the Gascoyne Province the supersuite intrudes metasedimentary rocks of the Leake Spring Metamorphics. In the Mooloo Zone, the supersuite intrudes metasedimentary rocks of the Moogie Metamorphics and meta-igneous rocks of the Halfway Gneiss. In the Errabiddy Shear Zone and Yarlarweelor Gneiss Complex, the Moorarie Supersuite intrudes the Camel Hills Metamorphics, the Bertibubba Supersuite, and reworked Archean granitic gneisses (AP_-mgnl-YNAY, AP_-mgnw-YNAY). Along the northern edge of the Yilgarn Craton, the supersuite also intrudes Archean granitic gneisses (A-mngl-YNA, A-mngw-YNA) and late Archean granites.  The Moorarie Supersuite is unconformably overlain by the Pooranoo Metamorphics. This relationship is evident in the Limejuice Zone, although the effects of younger tectonic events have obscured the relationship in the Mangaroon and Mutherbukin Zones. The supersuite is intruded by granites of the Durlacher Supersuite, most notably in the Mangaroon, Boora Boora, and Mutherbukin Zones. The Moorarie Supersuite is unconformably overlain by sedimentary rocks of the Mesoproterozoic Edmund Group to the east and by sedimentary rocks of the Phanerozoic Carnarvon Basin to the west. Numerous dykes of the Neoproterozoic Mundine Well Dolerite intrude the Moorarie Supersuite.",,17,,,,8,,,,1817,11,1773,,"About 50 granites from the Moorarie Supersuite have been dated using SHRIMP U-Pb zircon techniques: the granites yield igneous crystallization ages between 1817 Â± 11 Ma and 1773 Â± 15 Ma (GSWA 142931; Nelson, 1999a, and GSWA 195858; GSWA preliminary data, respectively). Overall, magmatism in the southern part of the Gascoyne Province, and adjacent Yarlarweelor Gneiss Complex, appears to be slightly older than in the Minnie Creek batholith and northern Gascoyne Province. The significance of this age trend is unclear. Apparently older magmatism in the southern part of the province at c. 1825 Ma is restricted to a suite of volumetrically minor peraluminous, two-mica granite dykes and plugs (P_-MO-ggev; Occhipinti and Sheppard, 2001). The two dated rocks (GSWA 142924 and 142931) are leucocratic, and contain very low abundances of Zr (<60 ppm), Y (<5 ppm) and REE (rare earth elements). These characteristics are shared by several other granites in the region that failed to yield igneous crystallization ages (Sheppard et al., 2007). These two samples were re-examined with cathodoluminescence in 2009, and extra spots analyzed by SHRIMP. The two samples yield igneous crystallization ages of 1817 Â± 11 Ma (GSWA 142931; Nelson, 1999a) and 1812 Â± 9 Ma (GSWA 142924; Nelson, 1999b).",No,,,13,e,No,Published,Yes,Yes,P_,MO,,13,16,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

It has an estimated maximum thickness of about 1400 m and is apparently overlain by the Yilgatherra Formation of the Edmund Group. The succession was laid down in a braided fluvial environment and comprises coarse-grained feldspathic quartz sandstone and pebbly sandstone with subordinate conglomerate and finer grained sandstone. Paleocurrent data indicate that sediment transport was towards the southeast. The Mount Augustus Sandstone has not been dated directly. However, age data from detrital zircons from within the formation and its relationship to the overlying Edmund Group suggests it was probably deposited between c. 1680 and 1610 Ma.","The Mount Augustus Sandstone is exposed in the type area on MOUNT AUGUSTUS and on adjacent parts of eastern MOUNT PHILLIPS. It also outcrops in the fault-bounded core of the Sullivan Anticline on southwestern CANDOLLE, where it includes rocks that were formerly mapped as part of the Tringadee Formation by Muhling et al. (1977).  The formation has an estimated maximum thickness of about 1400 m, based on a measured thickness of 1150 m for an incomplete section near Mount Samuel (Zone 50, MGA 445730E 7303190N), on southwest MOUNT AUGUSTUS. The Mount Augustus Sandstone is thinner on southwest CANDOLLE where its total thickness is probably about 800 m. ","The Mount Augustus Sandstone was named after the topographic feature of Mount Augustus (Zone 50, MGA 484190E 7309650N) on the MOUNT AUGUSTUS 1:250 000 map sheet. The term was first used by Brakel and Muhling (1976) and later formally defined by Muhling and Brakel (1985) as the lowermost formation within the Edmund Subgroup of the Bangemall Group. Martin et al. (2008) followed this usage and placed the Mount Augustus Sandstone, along with the lowermost Yilgatherra Formation, at the base of the redefined Edmund Group of the Bangemall Supergroup. An alternative interpretation was adopted by Chuck (1984) who considered the Mount Augustus Sandstone to be a separate stratigraphic unit underlying the Edmund Group. This view was also held by Cooper et al. (1998) who correlated the Mount Augustus Sandstone with similar coarse-grained sedimentary rocks in the Bresnahan Group.   The Mount Augustus Sandstone is now considered to be an older sedimentary unit that is separate from the Edmund Group. This interpretation is based on its considerable thickness (~1.4 km), dominantly fluvial character, and stratigraphic position where it underlies the Yilgatherra Formation &mdash; the basal unit of the Edmund Group &mdash; on southwest CANDOLLE. In addition, the localized preservation of the Mount Augustus Sandstone contrasts with the laterally continuous units in the lower Edmund Group in the same area and suggests that much of the Mount Augustus Sandstone was removed from the western Capricorn Orogen during a period of pre-Yilgatherra Formation erosion. There are also important differences in sediment transport patterns between the Mount Augustus Sandstone and the lowermost Edmund Group. Paleocurrent data from the former indicates the fluvial transport direction was consistently towards the southeast and east, whereas data from similar facies in the Yilgatherra Formation show considerable local variation.  Whether or not the Mount Augustus Sandstone is a correlative of the Bresnahan Group, as proposed by Cooper et al. (1998) remains equivocal. Both units are present in approximately the same stratigraphic position and are composed largely of thick fluvial deposits, derived from a granitic source area to the northwest and west of their respective outcrop areas. However, there is no observed continuity between the two units, and this, together with the poor age controls on both units, renders a direct correlation uncertain.",,"The Mount Augustus Sandstone (P_-_au-sp) generally consists of feldspathic sandstone and pebbly sandstone, interbedded with subordinate conglomerate and siltstone. Units containing a higher proportion of sandstone (P_-_au-st) and conglomerate (P_-_au-sc) are also recognized on southwest CANDOLLE and southwest MOUNT AUGUSTUS, respectively.  The angular unconformity between the Mount Augustus Sandstone and the underlying schistose metasedimentary and granitic rocks of the Gascoyne Province is exposed at the northwestern end of Mount Augustus and in the area around Mount Samuel on MOUNT AUGUSTUS, and also in the Sullivan Anticline on CANDOLLE. At Mount Augustus the unconformity surface has a local paleorelief of 60 m (Muhling and Brakel, 1985) and is immediately overlain by massive, very coarse grained feldspathic lithic sandstone, containing scattered angular to subrounded pebbles, cobbles and boulders up to 0.6 m in diameter. Lenticular beds of pebble- to cobble-conglomerate are also observed. Vein quartz is by far the dominant clast type, but micaceous schist, phyllite, and a quartz-tourmaline rock are also abundant. Similar lithologies are observed in the core of the Sullivan Anticline (Zone 50, MGA 538920E 7246800N), although here the pebbly to bouldery sandstone is cut by a strong foliation, at a high angle to bedding. In the area around Mount Samuel, the basal part of the Mount Augustus Sandstone is largely made up of conglomerate and sandstone (P_-_au-sc).  Above the basal unconformity, there is little stratigraphic variation within the sandstone unit (P_-_au-sp), which mostly comprises very thick, tabular to lenticular beds of pebbly to cobbly sandstone, medium- to very coarse-grained sandstone, and pebble- to cobble-conglomerate. Although these beds are commonly massive or crudely parallel stratified in the very lowest levels, most of the stratigraphy is medium- to very large-scale cross-stratified with normally graded sets. Some over-steepened foresets and deformed stratification are also present locally. Stratification is defined either by changes in sediment grain-size, or by variations in heavy mineral concentration, particularly detrital tourmaline, which is abundant in many beds. Thin beds of parallel-planar laminated or ripple cross-laminated, fine- to medium-grained sandstone are also present locally between the thicker bedded parts, and symmetrical, sinuous-crested ripples are preserved on some bedding surfaces.  Paleocurrent data from trough cross-stratified sandstone and pebbly sandstone beds on MOUNT AUGUSTUS, MOUNT PHILLIPS, and CANDOLLE show that sediment transport was generally directed towards the southeast, with some local flow towards the east and northeast.  A sample of sandstone taken from unit P_-_au-sp on MOUNT PHILLIPS is coarse- to very coarse-grained and contains disseminated feldspar (GSWA 148972, Wingate et al., 2007). It is dominated by quartz (about 60%) and alkali feldspar (35%, orthoclase and microcline) with interstitial limonite (3-5%), and accessory biotite, riebeckite, and zircon. Single-crystal quartz and feldspar grains are poorly sorted, but well rounded, typically 0.5 - 3 mm in diameter, but sparse grains of polycrystalline quartz are also present. Rare rounded grains of zircon or monazite range up to 0.2 mm in diameter and blue riebeckite forms prisms, rosettes, and small (up to 0.5 mm) spherulites that cut across quartz and feldspar grains. Interstitial limonite may have been derived from carbonate minerals.    ","The Mount Augustus Sandstone is interpreted as a braided fluvial deposit based on its generally coarse grain-size, compositional immaturity, limited range of traction-dominated sedimentary structures, and unidirectional paleocurrents. Finer grained intervals with symmetrical, sinuous-crested ripples were probably deposited in shallow fluvial pools during low-water stages. The feldspathic nature of the sandstones suggests they were sourced from granitic rocks in the west-central Capricorn Orogen, although quartzite boulders that are locally present near the base of the succession were probably locally derived.  The unidirectional paleocurrent regime and uniform nature of the stratigraphy throughout the outcrop area suggests the Mount Augustus Sandstone was formerly a continuous, ribbon-like fluvial deposit, rather than one that was laid down in isolated, faulted sub-basins. The formation's present distribution, where it is located in close proximity to the Lyons River and Flint Hill Fault systems, appears to result from post-depositional down-faulting in these areas, which preserved the fluvial succession from much of the subsequent pre-Edmund Group erosion.",,1400,,"The Mount Augustus Sandstone unconformably overlies Paleoproterozoic rocks of the Gascoyne Province, comprising low-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Pooranoo Metamorphics (P_-POb-mlpc), Leake Spring Metamorphics (P_-LS-xmd-mk), and granitic rocks of the Moorarie Supersuite (P_-MO-gmp and P_-MO-gmeb; Sheppard et al., 2010). The nature of the contact between the Mount Augustus Sandstone and the Yilgatherra Formation (P_-MEy-st), the lowest formation in the Edmund Group, is unclear as this boundary is generally either faulted or not exposed. The Yilgatherra Formation appears to overlie the Mount Augustus Sandstone in the eastern closure Sullivan Anticline on CANDOLLE (Zone 50, MGA 594600E 7249700N), however the exact nature of the contact in this area is equivocal.",,17,,,,4,,,,1679,,1610,,"The age constraints on the Mount Augustus Sandstone are poor and based on geochronological data from detrital zircons in samples collected from the formation and also from the age of the overlying Edmund Group. These data suggest the Mount Augustus Sandstone was probably deposited between c. 1679 and 1610 Ma.   The maximum depositional age of the Mount Augustus Sandstone is provided by the youngest group of detrital zircons in a sandstone sample (GSWA 148972) taken from the formation near Ulna Well (Zone 50, MGA 437561E 7323910N) on MOUNT PHILLIPS, which has been dated at 1679 Â± 3 Ma (Martin et al., 2008). A less conservative estimate is provided by the youngest zircon, dated at 1613 Â± 21 Ma (1&sigma;). Wingate et al. (2007) determined a conservative maximum depositional age of 1664 Â± 6 Ma from the same data, by excluding certain analyses from the youngest statistically coherent group. The youngest group of detrital zircons in a sandstone sample from unit P_-_au-st of the Mount Augustus Sandstone on CANDOLLE is less useful in this regard and gives a conservative maximum depositional age of 1753 Â± 28 (GSWA 149029, Wingate et al., 2010).  The minimum age for the Mount Augustus Sandstone is loosely constrained by the maximum age of the overlying Edmund Group.

In southwestern WEEBO, where the formation is best exposed, it consists of an altered olivine adcumulate body at the base overlain by olivine orthocumulate with pockets of olivine harrisite. The orthocumulate continues upwards into layered gabbro followed by a finer grained unit at the top with pyroxene-spinifex texture. Stratigraphically, the Mount Clifford Komatiite lies between the underlying Hangover Formation and the overlying Mount Fouracre Basalt.","In aeromagnetic images, the Mount Clifford Komatiite outlines major folds on WILDARA and WEEBO, in the areas of Marshall Pool (Zone 51, MGA 302592E 6866232N), Mount Clifford (Zone 51, MGA 310485E 6849606N), Mount Fouracre (Zone 51, MGA 302795E 6844714N), North Well (Zone 51, MGA 292309E 6856560N) and Wildara Outcamp (Zone 51, MGA 288868E 6876485N).

The Mount Clifford Komatiite was informally referred to as the  Mount Clifford peridotites  by Barnes et al. (1974), who described a detailed section through a typical flow unit in a diamond drillhole near Mount Clifford. Textural and lithological variations within the Mount Clifford Komatiite are best exposed in the Mount Clifford area (Donaldson, 1982; Hill et al., 2001), which is the type locality for the formation.",,"The base of the Mount Clifford Formation in the Mount Clifford area is a thick olivine adcumulate unit, which locally outcrops as silica caprock that pseudomorphs the cumulate texture. The adcumulate body passes upwards into olivine orthocumulate with lenses of olivine harrisite. The orthocumulate-harrisite zone is overlain by a variety of rock types including porphyritic pyroxenite, coarse clinopyroxenite and pyroxene-rich gabbro. These continue upwards into layered gabbro with a fine-grained zone at the top with locally preserved pyroxene-spinifex texture. Based on the conformable nature of the contact between gabbro and ultramafic rocks, and the presence of spinifex texture, the gabbro has been interpreted to be an extrusive differentiated component formed within the same flow complex as the adcumulate body (Hill et al., 2001). The gabbroic sequence is overlain by spinifex-textured komatiite flows with laterally restricted olivine orthocumulate (Donaldson, 1982; Hill et al., 2001). Metamorphism is typically in the greenschist facies.  The olivine adcumulate base of the Mount Clifford Komatiite is locally exposed on the limbs of a north-northeasterly plunging syncline at Marshall Pool (e.g. JKSEGN000114, Zone 51, MGA 302213E 6865666N). The core of this syncline is occupied by a thick sequence of komatiite flows and komatiitic basalt. Thinner komatiite flows (2-5 m thick) preserve a variety of spinifex textures, whereas the thicker flows are predominantly olivine orthocumulates (Hill et al., 2001).  The komatiite unit between Victor Well and Royal Arthur Bore in the eastern part of the Wildara-Leonora greenstone belt was described by Th&eacute;baud et al. (2012), who called it the Sullivans unit. The base of this steeply east-dipping unit consists mainly of serpentinized, fine-grained, olivine ortho- to mesocumulate. The basal zone passes upwards into coarse-grained olivine mesocumulate with discontinuous lenses of olivine adcumulate. The mesocumulate is in turn overlain by olivine orthocumulate or spinifex-textured flows. The spinifex textures suggest younging to the east. Hyaloclastite flow-top breccias have been identified locally.  The Mount Clifford Komatiite hosts nickel mineralization in several places in the Marshall Pool - Mount Clifford region, most notably near Mount Clifford (Travis, 1975).",,,,,"The Mount Clifford Komatiite overlies the Hangover Formation (A-KGho-b) and underlies the Mount Fouracre Basalt (A-KGmf-b).

The outcrops on the YAMPI, CHARNLEY, and LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 map sheets all contain pink or white, euhedral K-feldspar (microperthite, 2-3 cm across), green or cream plagioclase (up to 1 cm across), and blue-grey quartz 0.5-1.0 cm across (Gellatly et al., 1969; Gellatly and Halligan, 1971; Tyler and Griffin, 1993; Griffin et al., 1993). In some places on CHARNLEY plagioclase has altered to sericite and clinozoisite (Gellatly et al., 1969). Other minerals present include biotite (found in elgonate clots associated with chlorite and clinozoisite), muscovite (which can replace some of the K-feldspars), and hornblende (which post-dates the biotite and chlorite). The groundmass of the Mount Disaster Porphyry is fine-grained, granular, and K-feldspar dominated with quartz, biotite, and almost no plagioclase (Gellatly et al., 1969; Gellatly and Halligan, 1971; Tyler and Griffin, 1993; Griffin et al., 1993).

The porphyry commonly intrudes the Whitewater Volcanics with the inclusion of tuffaceous xenoliths but the formation may also be a subvolcanic equivalent of the volcanics. The contact relationship with the Mondooma Granite is unclear in some locations and appears to be coeval. Xenoliths 8-30 cm across of coarsely porphyritic material resembling the Mount Disaster Porphyry has found at the margins of the Mondooma Granite with both sharp and gradational contacts possibly suggesting there was little difference in composition and temperature at the time of intrusion (Gellatly et al., 1969; Gellatly and Halligan, 1971).

It consists of four formations. In ascending order they are the Walsh Tillite, Traine Formation, Throssell Shale, and Estaughs Formation. The Mount House Group is unconformable on the c. 1800 Ma Kimberley Group. The group has been tentitivelly correlated with the Moonlight Valley Tillite in the Duerdin Group of the east Kimberley (Gellatly and Halligan, 1970) and the Landrigan and Moonlight Valley Tillites by Derrick and Playford (1973), Plumb and Gemuts (1976), and Plumb (1981). More recent work combining geochronology, stratigraphy, and detailed lithological comparisons has lead to correlations between the Mount House Group and the Louisa Downs Group in the east Kimberley (Coats and Preiss, 1980). This work suggests the the glacial interval preserved in the Mount House Group corresponds to the Marinoan glaciation event worldwide. The group consists of a basal tillite overlain by algal and stromatolitic dolomite which is overlain by coarse- and fine-grained clastics including shales, siltstone, and sandstone with scattered glacial erratics sourced from the underlying c. 1835 Ma Speewah Group and c. 1800 Ma Kimberley Group. The group is more-or-less flat-lying and undeformed. ","The Mount House Group outcrops in the central and west Kimberley region on the MOUNT ELIZABETH, CHARNLEY, LENNARD RIVER, and LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 map sheets. ","The Mount House Group was probably named after the exposures near Mount House, approximatley 7 km southest of Mount House Homestead off the Mornington Road (MOUNT HOUSE 1:100 000; LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000). ",,"Lithologies within the Mount House Group are mainly glaciogenic. The Walsh Tillite represents deposition from a retreating continental glaciation. It preserves a matrix-supported, polymictic, pebble-cobble-boulder tillite with a matrix made of a green siltstone or shale. The Walsh Tillite is topped by an algal or stromatolitic dolomite. The Traine Formation conformably overlies the Walsh Tillite and is a green to brown, coarse-grained, lithic sandstone with minor sandy dolomite and dolomitic sandstone. The Traine Formation contains scattered glacial erratics up to 2.5 m diameter. The Throssell Shale either conformably overlies the the Traine Formation is gradational above the Walsh Tillite to the west on LANSDOWNE 1:250 000. The Throssell Shale is a blue-grey or grey-green, poorly laminated micaceous siltstone with minor shale interbeds.

146,75712,P_-POJ-md,145,Mount James Subgroup,1,"Pelitic and psammitic schist, metamorphosed quartz sandstone, feldspathic metasandstone and metaconglomerate","The Mount James Subgroup contains a well-defined stratigraphy and on this basis has been divided into a lower fluvial unit called the Biddenew Formation (P_- POb-mtef) and an upper marine quartzite unit called the Spring Camp Formation (P_-POs-mtqs). The Biddenew Formation outcrops mainly in the Mutherbukin and Mooloo Zones but thins rapidly south in the Paradise Zone and does not outcrop in the Errabiddy Shear Zone. The Biddenew Formation is also present in the Mangaroon Zone to the west of the Collins Fault, in the northern part of the Gascoyne Province. The Spring Camp Formation is laterally extensive and a highly recognizable stratigraphic marker that outcrops across the southern Gascoyne Province from the Limejuice Zone through to the Errabiddy Shear Zone. The Spring Camp Formation does not appear to be present in the Mangaroon Zone, but may be equivalent to undivided feldspathic metasandstones (P_-PO-mtsf). The Biddenew Formation is a package of immature medium- to coarse-grained feldspathic low grade metasedimentary rocks that show abundant centimetre- to metre-scale trough cross-bedding, scour horizons and discontinuous channel horizons that are characteristic of high energy fluvial environments; it contains abundant metaconglomerate, pebble metasandstone and feldspathic metasandstone. The Spring Camp Formation consists of a single horizon of a pure, mostly recrystallized sugary textured white quartzite that contains abundant asymmetric and longitudinal ripples, trough cross-stratification and occasional current lineations indicative of deposition in a shallow marine to intertidal environment. The top of the succession is nowhere exposed, but most units of the Mount James Subgroup are unconformably overlain by sedimentary rocks of the Mount Augustus sandstone or the Edmund Group. The subgroup was deposited sometime between c. 1760 and 1680 Ma.","The Mount James Subgroup outcrops out mainly in the Mutherbukin and Mooloo Zones of the Gascoyne Province (EUDAMULLAH, MOUNT PHILLIPS, MOUNT AUGUSTUS, LOCKIER, YINNETHARRA, PINK HILLS, GLENBURGH, and DAURIE CREEK) although the Biddenew Formation occurs in the Mangaroon Zone on northern TOWERA and southern UAROO, and isolated outcrops of Spring Camp Formation quartzites (P_-POs-mtqs) lie in the Errabiddy Shear Zone on YALBRA, ERRABIDDY, and MARQUIS. As most of the subgroup has been extensively folded and faulted during the Edmundian Orogeny and subsequent events, most outcrops are small (less than 5 km 2 ), although on MOUNT PHILLIPS on the southern side of the Ti Tree Syncline there is a single extensive outcrop of semipelitic staurolite-bearing schist of approximately 100 km 2 . The fluvial Biddenew Formation is extensively present in the Limejuice and Mutherbukin Zones but appears to thin to the south so that only some members are intermittently present in the Mooloo and Paradise Zones and totally absent in the Errabiddy Shear Zone. A nearly complete stratigraphic section of the Biddenew Formation is present in the Johnson Creek Syncline in the Mangaroon Zone on TOWERA and UAROO. The Spring Camp Formation is comprised of a single, laterally extensive marine quartzite that can be traced from the Limejuice Zone through to the Errabiddy Shear Zone, but does not appear to be present in the Mangaroon Zone.","The type area for the Mount James Subgroup is defined in the explanatory notes to the MOUNT PHILLIPS 1:250 000 map sheet (Williams et al., 1978) as the area between Mount Gascoyne and Spring Camp outcamp on southern YINNETHARRA and PINK HILLS. The derivation of the name  Mount James  for the formation is not known, although presumably it is after Mount James, a significant hill some 15 km to the west-northwest of the type area. The subdivision and reclassification of the Mount James Formation to the Mount James Subgroup and its constituent Biddenew and Spring Camp formations was conducted during the second edition mapping in the type area on YINNETHARRA and PINK HILLS in 2007-08 (Sheppard et al., 2008; Sheppard and Johnson, in prep.). The Biddenew Formation was named after Biddenew Creek, which flows from the southern side of Mount Gascoyne and the Spring Camp Formation after Spring Camp Creek (rather than the now abandoned Spring Camp outcamp) that flows northeastward from the western margin of Mount Gascoyne.",,"The Mount James Subgroup contains a well-defined stratigraphy and on this basis has been divided into a lower fluvial unit called the Biddenew Formation (P_-POb-mtef) and an upper marine quartzite unit called the Spring Camp Formation (P_-POs-mtqs). The Biddenew Formation is a package of immature medium- to coarse-grained feldspathic low-grade metasandstones (P_-POb-mtef, P_-POb-mqef, P_-POb-mxq), including low- to medium-grade pelitic (P_-POb-mlsm), semipelitic (P_-POb-mhs), and sericitic schists and phyllites (P_-POb-mlpc). The more abundant feldspathic metasandstones and metaconglomerates show abundant cm- to m-scale trough cross-bedding, scour horizons and discontinuous channel horizons that are characteristic of high energy fluvial environments. The base of the formation is locally marked by a matrix supported, cobble to boulder metaconglomerate (P_-POb-mxq) that contains up to and over 60% rounded quartz vein clasts. Elsewhere the unconformable base is marked either by fine grained sericite or biotite schists (P_-POb-mlpc, P_-POb-mlsm) that appear to be lateral equivalents of the metaconglomerate or pebble (P_-POb-mqef) and feldspathic metasandstone (P_-POb-mtef) of the overlying members, indicating that this is a very transgressive sequence or that it was deposited over an angular unconformity with significant topography. Where the entire stratigraphy is present, it is observed that the lowermost metaconglomerate grades upward into a granule to pebbly feldspathic metasandstone (P_- POb-mqef). This in turn grades up into a medium-grained feldspathic metasandstone (P_ POb-mtef) with the progressive loss of pebbles and gritty horizons. This unit contains local, discontinuous gritty or pebbly horizons and is the thickest member of the Biddenew Formation. Directly to the east and west of Mount Gascoyne the base of the feldspathic metasandstone is locally underlain by a sequence of 2-3 m-thick interbedded siltstones, fine grained metasandstones, and medium-grained feldspathic metasandstones (P_-POb-mhs).  The top of the feldspathic metasandstone member (P_- POb-mtef) of the Biddenew Formation grades rapidly up into a pure, mostly recrystallized sugary textured white quartzite of the Spring Camp Formation (P_-POs-mtqs). This quartzite contains abundant asymmetric and longitudinal ripples, trough cross-stratification and occasional current lineations indicative of deposition in a shallow marine to intertidal environment. The stratigraphic top of the Spring Camp Formation is nowhere present and so the original thickness of this upper marine unit is not known. However, the Spring Camp Formation is very laterally extensive, being present as a distinct mappable unit from the Limejuice Zone in the north through to the Errabiddy Shear Zone in the south &mdash; a distance of 120 km. This is in contrast to the Biddenew Formation which is laterally extensive in the Limejuice and Mutherbukin Zones but appears to thin rapidly to the south where it is only a thin, discontinuous unit in the Paradise Zone and is absent from the Errabiddy Shear Zone. Both the Biddenew and Spring Camp Formations are overlain with angular unconformity by low-grade sedimentary rocks of the Mount Augustus Sandstone (P_-_au-sp) and Edmund Group (P_-ME-xs-k) suggesting that the Mount James Subgroup must have been tilted prior to deposition of these Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks.",,,700,,"In the Limejuice Zone scattered and isolated outcrops of quartzite (P_-POs-mtqs), metasandstone (P_-POb-mtef), and phyllite (P_-POb-mlpc) sit unconformably on granites of the Moorarie Supersuite (P_-MO-g) that form the Minnie Creek batholith. At and around Mount Augustus, these rocks are unconformably overlain by the Mount Augustus Sandstone (P_-_au-sp).   In the Mutherbukin Zone most members of the Biddenew Formation and Spring Camp Formation are present. The Spring Camp Formation quartzites are mostly in conformable contact with the underlying members of the Biddenew Formation except where they are in faulted contact with the Halfway Gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgn) and granites of the Moorarie Supersuite (P_-MO-g). The Biddenew Formation unconformably overlies most basement rocks including the Halfway Gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgn) and various granites of the Moorarie Supersuite, and schists of both the Moogie Metamorphics (P_-MG-xmh-mk) and Leake Spring Metamorphics (P_-LS-xmd-mk). Along the southern margin of the Ti Tree Syncline rocks of the Biddenew Formation are in faulted contact with low grade sedimentary rocks of the Edmund Group (P_- ME-xs-k). In this area the Mount James Subgroup is intruded by sheets, stocks, dykes, and veins of younger granites that belong to the Durlacher Supersuite (P_-DU-g) and the Thirty Three Supersuite (P_-TT-g). Abundant metre-wide unmetamorphosed mafic dykes of the Mundine Well Dolerite (P_-_mw-od) also intrude the Mount James Subgroup.   On the southern parts of YINNETHARRA and PINK HILLS the Mount James Subgroup is overlain with angular unconformity by Edmund Group sedimentary rocks (P_-ME). In the Mooloo and Paradise Zones the Biddenew Formation is much attenuated, but the Spring Camp Formation quartzites are well represented. These units unconformably overlay higher grade metasedimentary rocks of the Moogie Metamorphics (P_-MG-xmh-md), gneisses of the Dalgaringa Supersuite (P_-DA-mg), and granites of the Moorarie Supersuite (P_-MO-g).   In the Errabiddy Shear Zone, Spring Camp Formation quartzites are everywhere in tectonic contact with older and younger units including gneisses of the Yarlarweelor Gneiss Complex (AP_-mgnl-YNAY), granites of the Moorarie Supersuite (P_-MO-g), granites of the Durlacher Supersuite (P_-DU-g), Edmund Group sedimentary rocks (P_-ME-xs-k), and the Narimbunna Dolerite (P_-_nr-od).  In the Mangaroon Zone the Biddenew Formation unconformably overlies multiply deformed, interlayered pelitic and psammitic schist of the Leake Spring Metamorphics (P_-LS-mhs). This contact on the eastern limb of the Johnson Creek Syncline is progressively truncated by the Collins Fault. On the western side of the Kimbers Fault, pebbly sandstone (P_-POb-mqef) and phyllite (P_-POb-mlpc) are intruded by porphyritic granitc rocks of the Durlacher Supersuite (e.g. FJKGAS000502, Zone 50, MGA 320705E 7450674N).

The youngest detrital zircon in the sample has a  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1758 Â± 18 Ma, providing a maximum age of deposition (Wingate et al., 2009a). Five samples of the Spring Camp Formation quartzite (P_-POs-mtqs), from various parts of the southern Gascoyne Province, were also selected for SHRIMP U-Pb zircon geochronology to determine their maximum ages of deposition and provenance. The sample from furthest south on YALBRA in the Errabiddy Shear Zone (Nelson, 2001a) indicated a very local provenance, mainly from the Archean Yilgarn Craton. The youngest detrital zircon age component (26 grains) yielded a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 2616 Â± 6 Ma (Nelson, 2001a) providing a maximum age for its deposition. The other four samples from the Limejuice Zone through to the Mooloo Zone, including two samples from the type locality at Mount James on YINNETHARRA, yielded very similar results (Nelson 2001b; Wingate et al., 2010a, b; Wingate et al., 2009b). The youngest zircons in all samples range in age between c. 1800 Ma and c. 1780 Ma, only slightly older than that obtained from the Biddenew Formation sample. The metasediments unconformably overlie granites of the Moorarie Supersuite, the youngest of which is dated at 1782 Â± 5 Ma.  A younger age limit for sediment deposition is constrained only indirectly. A phyllite from the basal part of the Biddenew Formation is unconformably overlain by the Mount Augustus Sandstone, and detrital zircons from the sandstone indicate a maximum depositional age of 1679 Â± 3 Ma (Wingate et al., 2007).

Joints in the rocks are lined with coarse, prismatic, undeformed kyanite (Stewart, 2004).   In thin section, the quartz-andalusite schist is characterized by a strongly foliated matrix assemblage of quartz aggregate ribbons - graphite - skeletal andalusite - skeletal kyanite(-muscovite) and synkinematic poikiloblastic andalusite (Czarnota et al., 2008; Goscombe et al., 2009).

The formation is composed of ferruginous sandstone, conglomerate, and pebbly sandstone and minor quartz sandstone, siltstone, dolomitic siltstone, and dolostone. These rocks were laid down in a braided delta and shallow-marine setting that formed part of an intracontinental foreland basin.

It has a maximum thickness of at least 1200 m.","The Mount McGrath Beds was named by MacLeod et al. (1963) in reference to the predominantly coarse-grained sedimentary rocks that are present beneath the Duck Creek Dolomite in the then newly defined Wyloo Group. The exact stratigraphic context for the beds was uncertain, however, and this unit was thought to both overlie and underlie the Cheela Springs Basalt. Subsequently, Halligan and Daniels (1964) and de la Hunty (1964) confirmed that these coarse-grained sedimentary rocks are located above the Cheela Springs Basalt and upgraded the name of the unit to Mount McGrath Formation, with the Cheela Springs Basalt included as a member of this formation. This nomenclature was later followed by Daniels (1970) and Trendall (1975, 1979).  Horwitz (1980) recognized the presence of a regional disconformity at the top of the Cheela Springs Basalt Member and removed these rocks from the Mount McGrath Formation, while at the same time upgrading them to the level of formation. The Mount McGrath Formation was then defined as  the essentially clastic rocks that overlie disconformably the Cheela Springs Basalt and overlap unconformably onto older formations. It is overlain conformably by the Duck Creek Dolomite, which itself overlaps onto older units.  This definition was followed by Seymour et al. (1988) and Thorne and Seymour (1991), with the qualification that along the southeastern margin of the Wyloo Dome, the Mount McGrath Formation also unconformably overlies the Wooly Dolomite.   Although the disconformity at the base of the Mount McGrath Formation was recognized by various workers (Horwitz, 1980; Seymour et al., 1988; Thorne and Seymour, 1991), its temporal significance was unknown and did not lead to a redefinition of the Wyloo Group. More recently a c. 2208 Ma mafic magmatic event, responsible for deposition of the Cheela Springs Basalt and coeval dolerite intrusion into the Beasley River Quartzite and underlying Turee Creek Group has been identified and provides a reliable minimum age for the lower Wyloo Group (Martin et al., 1998; M&uuml;ller et al., 2005; Martin and Morris, 2010). In contrast, the maximum age of the upper Wyloo Group is fixed by ages of c. 2030 and 2008 Ma that were published for the Wooly Dolomite and for dolerite dykes that post-date the lower Wyloo Group but pre-date the Mount McGrath Formation (M&uuml;ller et al., 2005). These dates show that a hiatus of at least 200 Ma separated deposition of the lower and upper parts of the Wyloo Group and that this time break was partly coeval with the 2215-2145 Ma Ophthalmia Orogeny in the southern Pilbara region (Rasmussen et al., 2005). This has necessitated a revision of the Wyloo Group, with the lower Wyloo Group (Beasley River Quartzite, Cheela Springs Basalt) now being assigned to the Shingle Creek Group, and the upper Wyloo Group (Mount McGrath Formation, Duck Creek Dolomite, June Hill Volcanics, and Ashburton Formation) being retained within the revised Wyloo Group (P_-WY-s). The c. 2030 Ma age for the Wooly Dolomite indicates that this unit was laid down separately &mdash; following the Ophthalmia Orogeny &mdash; in the interval between deposition of the Shingle Creek and Wyloo Groups.  No type section for the Mount McGrath Formation was defined by MacLeod et al. (1963), however, the succession is well exposed around Zone 50, MGA 440890E, 7479200N, 21 km southeast of Mount McGrath on eastern WYLOO.",,"The Mount McGrath Formation is composed of ferruginous sandstone, conglomerate, and pebbly sandstone, together with quartz sandstone and siltstone. Dolostone and dolomitic siltstone are also present in upper parts of the stratigraphy. Sandstone, pebbly sandstone, and conglomerate units are generally resistant to weathering and erosion and form prominent hills and strike ridges. Siltstones and dolostones are less resistant and usually outcrop as low mounds and recessive slopes. Dolostones may be partially covered by a thin Phanerozoic silica caprock.  Ferruginous sandstones are usually medium- to very coarse-grained and appear in units up to 20 m thick. Their internal structure is dominated by trough cross-stratification or less commonly by parallel-stratification or isolated scour-and-fill. Trough cross-stratification is present as individual sets or appears stacked to form thick cosets up to 40 m wide and with a maximum downcut of 3 m. Individual sets are 0.05 - 0.5 m (generally 0.1 - 0.25 m) thick. Both set and coset boundaries may be marked by a gravel lag. Paleocurrent data indicate that sediment transport was mostly towards the south and southwest with some flow towards the west and southeast locally (Thorne and Seymour, 1991). Quartz sandstones are mostly fine- to medium-grained with rare laminae of quartz granules or mud clasts. They display a wide range of sedimentary structures, including trough and tabular cross-stratification, parallel-stratification, and very low-angle planar cross-stratification. In addition, a variety of ripple types have been recognized. In most of them the laminae are of alternating quartz- and iron-rich layers. Subcritical to supercritical climbing ripple profiles are abundant. Symmetrical and asymmetrical straight-crested forms exhibit a complex internal structure, characterized by chevron upbuilding, form-discordant, and draped laminae and bidirectional cross-laminae. Ripple profiles are often overlain by irregular undulating laminae, which may constitute most of the thickness of the bed.   Pebbly sandstones mostly outcrop in lenticular units up to 8 m thick. Beds are either massive, parallel-stratified, or trough cross-stratified (sets 0.1 - 0.3 m thick). Pebbles are generally equant, 4-20 mm in diameter and set in a poorly sorted matrix of ferruginous lithic arenite or wacke. Ferruginous conglomerates are mostly clast-supported and appear in lenticular or tabular beds up to 4 m thick. Most exhibit parallel or very gently inclined stratification, with normal or inverse grading. Some thick-bedded conglomerates are structureless. Clasts are generally poorly sorted (4-60 mm), equant to bladed, and angular to well rounded. They are mainly of banded iron-formation (with hematite ore locally), vein-quartz, chert, quartz amygdales, and felsic igneous rock and appear to be derived principally from the Fortescue, Hamersley, and Turee Creek Groups, with a smaller contribution from the Shingle Creek Group.   Siltstones are mostly green to purple and are either parallel-laminated or ripple cross-laminated. They may incorporate beds of fine- to medium-grained quartz sandstone and intraclast pebble conglomerate or ferruginous, coarse-grained sandstone, pebbly sandstone, and conglomerate. Dolomitic siltstones are lighter in colour and commonly exhibit parallel or gently undulose lamination with rare shallow scours. In addition, decimetre-scale soft sediment folds are locally present.   Dolomitic siltstone is commonly transitional into crystalline dolostone, which appears as thin, isolated beds or as units 2-180 m thick. These carbonates are generally parallel-laminated, but may also contain small soft sediment folds and thin beds of intraformational breccia. Domical and columnar stromatolites are locally present.","Thorne and Seymour (1991) proposed that the Mount McGrath Formation was deposited in response to a major episode of uplift and erosion in the southeastern Hamersley Basin. To the southeast of the Hardey Syncline the principal controls on sedimentation were:  &bull; a tectonically active upland region of Mount Bruce Supergroup and Shingle Creek Group rocks located to the north and east of Paraburdoo; &bull; a coastal plain of variable width to the southwest of the upland; and &bull; a marine shelf of low wave energy located further to the southwest.  Braided streams, entering the marine environment from the upland area, constructed a delta complex on the folded, eroded surface of Shingle Creek Group and Mount Bruce Supergroup rocks (Thorne and Seymour, 1991). On proximal parts of the delta plain (close to the present day exposed margin of the Hamersley Basin), sedimentation took place in gravelly, braided fluvial channels. Near the delta front, deposition of mud and immature sand and gravel took place in shallow bays formed between the channels. Cleaner sands were laid down on bars located at the mouths of major channels. Mudstone and thin dolomite layers accumulated in deeper water farther offshore.  Near the Wyloo Dome, sediments from the uplifted southwestern Hamersley Basin were deposited as a distal deltaic complex on folded Shingle Creek Group and Mount Bruce Supergroup rocks. On the southern margin of the dome, sands were extensively reworked by coastal marine processes and deposited on delta front beaches. North of the dome, pre-Mount McGrath uplift and erosion was minimal and thin deltaic facies, together with thicker offshore shelf deposits, were laid conformably on the Cheela Springs Basalt.  The stratigraphy of the Mount McGrath Formation records a similar evolution throughout the eastern and central part of the Ashburton Basin (Thorne and Seymour, 1991). Much of the lower part of the succession contains a high proportion of coarse-grained rocks, and records the main period of source area uplift, clastic input, and delta growth. In contrast, the upper part of the formation, which contains more fine-grained detritus and carbonate, was laid down during a period of waning siliciclastic supply, which led to the abandonment of the delta complex. The sedimentary facies in this upper part of the formation indicate that the dwindling of clastic input was accompanied by the gradual deepening of shelf waters. In the area north of the Wyloo Dome, the supply of coarse-grained siliciclastic material was generally low throughout deposition of the Mount McGrath Formation. Here, the trend towards deeper water sedimentation during the latter part of Mount McGrath Formation history is also evident.  The tectonic setting of the Mount McGrath Formation is thought to be an intracratonic foreland basin associated with the onset of the 1820-1770 Ma Capricorn Orogeny (Tyler and Thorne, 1990; Thorne and Seymour, 1991, Evans et al., 2003), although Martin and Morris (2010) suggest that the setting may have been extensional in its early stages.",,1200,,"The Mount McGrath Formation unconformably overlies the Fortescue, Hamersley, and Shingle Creek Groups and the Wooly Dolomite. It has a conformable, gradational contact with the overlying Duck Creek Dolomite. However, on UAROO, where there is significant structural complication, the lower contact is not exposed as it is either faulted out against the Uaroo Fault or intruded by voluminous granitic rocks of the Moorarie Supersuite (P_-MO-mggn). The upper contact is locally gradational into the Duck Creek Dolomite although this now forms a series of disrupted lenses and so coarse-grained rocks of the Mount McGrath Formation are mostly in ?sheared contact with interbedded sandstone and siltstone of the Ashburton Formation (P_-WYa-st).",,17,,,,4,,,,2008,,1799,,"The age of the Mount McGrath Formation is poorly constrained, but was deposited sometime between c. 2008 and 1799 Ma.  The older age limit for the Mount McGrath Formation is provided by its unconformable relationship to the c. 2008 Ma northwest-trending dolerite dykes in the underlying Shingle Creek Group (formerly lower Wyloo Group) (M&uuml;ller et al., 2005). The Mount McGrath Formation also unconformably overlies the Wooly Dolomite from which M&uuml;ller et al. (2005) acquired a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon depositional age of 2031 Â± 6 Ma.  The youngest detrital zircons obtained from two samples of sandstone from the lower part of the Mount McGrath Formation are some 450 million years older than the inferred maximum age of deposition for the unit.

The younger age limit for the Mount McGrath Formation is given by the SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 1799 Â± 8 Ma, obtained from the June Hill Volcanics that are located at a higher stratigraphic level in the Wyloo Group than the Mount McGrath Formation and overlying the Duck Creek Dolomite. Wilson et al. (2010) recorded a similar age of 1795 Â± 7 Ma from the same unit. Despite this younger age limit, depositional ages of 1806 Â± 9 Ma (GSWA 148922, Nelson, 2004c) and 1829 Â± 5 Ma (Sircombe, 2003) have been obtained from felsic volcanic units in the upper part of the Ashburton Formation, which stratigraphically overlies both the Duck Creek Dolomite and the June Hill Volcanics. Furthermore, SHRIMP U-Pb dates of 1804 Â± 7 Ma, 1800 Â± 7 Ma and 1801 Â± 6 Ma (Hall et al., 2001; Wingate et al., 2017a,b) have been obtained from accretionary lapilli tuffs within the Koonong Member of the Capricorn Group that unconformably overlies the Ashburton Formation. These results suggest that sedimentation in the upper part of the Wyloo Group was diachronous (Tyler and Thorne, 1990; Thorne and Seymour, 1991; Evans et al., 2003).",No,,,4,,No,Published,No,Yes,P_,WYm,,,,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No
2259,12926,A-HAr-xsk-c,4129,Mount McRae Shale,1,"Shale, dolomitic shale, chert, and minor banded iron-formation","The Mount McRae Shale is a 50 m-thick unit consisting predominantly of shale and dolomitic shale with minor chert, dolomite, and banded iron-formation (BIF). It conformably overlies the Mount Sylvia Formation and, in turn, is conformably overlain by the Dales Gorge Member of the Brockman Iron Formation. Various informal subdivisions of the formation have been recognized, based on the proportion of shale-to-chert and on the characteristics of different shale horizons (particularly the abundance of pyrite). A deep-water anoxic depositional environment for the Mount McRae Shale is indicated by the high organic carbon content, lack of any shallow-water sedimentary structures, and the predominance of siderite. The Mount McRae Shale was deposited between c. 2505 and 2494 Ma. It has both regional and global significance because it possibly contains the chronometrically defined Archean-Proterozoic boundary. It also has been the subject of numerous studies of the chemistry of the late Archean ocean and atmosphere.","The Mount McRae Shale is a 50 m-thick, predominantly recessive weathering unit exposed on the 1:250 000 map sheets DAMPIER, YARRALOOLA, PYRAMID, WYLOO, MOUNT BRUCE, ROY HILL, TUREE CREEK, NEWMAN, and ROBERTSON. It maintains roughly the same thickness throughout the Hamersley Basin, but is faulted out at Wyarma Spring in the nose of the Hardey Syncline (Zone 50, MGA 524753E 7460789N). It is also absent in the vicinity of Seven Mile Creek (Zone 50, MGA 556776E 7432112N) (Trendall and Blockley, 1970).","The type locality of the Mount McRae Shale is at Mount McRae (Zone 50, MGA 559598E 7535716N) from which the name is derived. The type section is about 5 km to the southeast at Mount Sylvia (Zone 50, MGA 561979E 7533671N), southwest of Hamersley Homestead (MacLeod et al., 1963). The type section of the Mount McRae Shale conformably overlies the type section of the Mount Sylvia Formation. The base of the formation is the top of Bruno s band. The top is marked by a thin shale horizon at the top of the informally named 'Colonial chert member' (Harmsworth et al., 1990). This shale horizon directly overlies a BIF unit, which at its upper contact contains a 15 cm-thick bed of holes (informally known as  Trendall s Bed of Holes ), formed by the weathering of carbonate nodules (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). The Mount McRae Shale is generally considered to be about 50 m thick (Trendall et al., 2004), but its thickness is highly variable between fold hinges and limbs.  The Mount McRae Shale was further informally subdivided by Trendall and Blockley (1970) into a basal shale member, a dolomite member, and an upper iron formation member. However, this subdivision only applies where the formation is thick and dolomite is present. Harmsworth et al. (1990) recognized a fourfold subdivision that included the Colonial chert member. An alternative fourfold informal subdivision is applied by BHP Billiton below the Colonial chert member and consists of the basal shale and chert zone, the chert zone, the nodule zone, and the shale zone (Kepert, 2018). A similar fourfold subdivision has recently been used by Raiswell et al. (2011) in which their lower two units (lower shale interval and BIF interval) are broadly equivalent to those of Kepert (2018). However, they combine the nodule zone and shale zone into a single unit (upper shale interval) and also recognize an upper carbonate interval. This upper carbonate interval appears on the sections of Raiswell et al. (2011) to underlie the Colonial chert member, which would make a fivefold subdivision.  By some mining companies, the Colonial chert member at the top of the Mount McRae Shale is included within the overlying Dales Gorge Member of the Brockman Iron Formation (Kepert, 2018). This is primarily for ore definition purposes because this unit is commonly mineralized. Six shale macrobands are recognized as informal markers within the Colonial chert member and are designated CS1 to CS6 (Kepert, 2018). Macrobands CS3, CS5, and CS6 are shale couplets with a thin BIF or chert parting, with CS6 containing an informal marker bed known as  Trendall s bed of holes . The appearance of this distinctive unit is the product of weathering of small carbonate concretions within the chert.",,"The Mount McRae Shale consists mainly of carbonaceous and dolomitic shale, sideritic BIF, chert, and dolomite. Carbonaceous and dolomitic shale and minor chert predominate in the lowermost informal subdivision, where four chert beds form conspicuous markers that are designated C1 to C4 (Kepert, 2018). The overlying informal subdivision consists predominantly of sideritic BIF, chert, and minor shale, which form a distinctive marker within the middle of well-exposed sections. This marker is colloquially known as the  triplets . Above this marker, the Mount McRae Shale consists predominantly of pyritic carbonaceous shale and minor chert. Pyrite nodules are particularly conspicuous at the base of this shale in the nodule zone immediately above the  triplets . Dolomite horizons are generally not common. They appear to be restricted to the northern and central parts of the southern Pilbara region (Trendall and Blockley, 1970) where they characteristically form lenticular units of carbonate turbidites and slump breccias in the middle to upper part of the Mount McRae Shale. KrapeÅ¾ et al. (2003) document rare siliciclastic turbidites in the basal Mount McRae Shale at Giles Point.","A deep-water anoxic depositional environment for the Mount McRae Shale is indicated by the high organic carbon content, the lack of any shallow-water sedimentary structures, and the predominance of siderite (Kaufmann et al., 2007; Reinhard et al., 2009). The depositional setting of the siliciclastic and carbonate turbidites is interpreted to be on basin floor fans in an outer shelf or slope environment, with the remainder of the formation deposited in a pelagic or hemipelagic environment (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003). The carbonate turbidites and slump breccias were point sourced from a coeval carbonate platform to the north and northeast.",,70,,"The basal and upper contacts of the Mount McRae Shale are both sharp and conformable, and defined by a change from BIF to shale and shale to BIF, respectively.",,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,2505,,2501,8,"The maximum depositional age of the Mount McRae Shale is constrained by the 2565 Â± 9 Ma Spherule marker bed in the underlying Bee Gorge Member of the Wittenoom Formation, and the minimum age by the 2495 Â± 16 Ma age of the DS2 shale macroband in the overlying Dales Gorge Member of the Brockman Iron Formation (Trendall et al. 2004).

The Mount McRae Shale and Mount Sylvia Formation were deposited well below storm wave base in a pelagic to hemipelagic environment between c. 2541 and 2501 Ma.","The Mount McRae Shale and Mount Sylvia Formation are exposed on the 1:250 000 map sheets DAMPIER, YARRALOOLA, PYRAMID, WYLOO, MOUNT BRUCE, ROY HILL, TUREE CREEK, NEWMAN, and ROBERTSON.

It consists of carbonaceous and dolomitic shale, chert, and dolomite and contains three distinctive beds of resistive BIF in the lower part. The lowermost BIF bed is about 2 m thick and marks the base of the unit. It is separated from the second 3 m-thick BIF by about 5 m of shale. These lower two BIFs are more similar to those of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation. However, generally lack well-developed pods and consist mainly of banded ferruginous chert (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). The second BIF is overlain by about 20 m of interbedded shale, chert, and carbonate turbidites. The uppermost BIF is informally known as 'Bruno s band' and is a well microbanded BIF about 5 m thick that more closely resembles that of the Dales Gorge Member. Above Bruno s band, carbonaceous and dolomitic shale and minor chert predominate in the lower part, where four chert beds form conspicuous markers that are designated C1 to C4 (Kepert, 2018). The overlying succession consists predominantly of sideritic BIF, chert, and minor shale, which form a distinctive marker within the middle of well-exposed sections. This marker is colloquially known as the  triplets . Above this marker the Mount McRae Shale consists predominantly of pyritic carbonaceous shale and minor chert. Pyrite nodules are particularly conspicuous at the base of this shale in the nodule zone immediately above the  triplets . Dolomite horizons are generally not common. They appear to be restricted to the northern and central Hamersley Basin (Trendall and Blockley, 1970) where they characteristically form lenticular units of carbonate turbidites and slump breccias in the middle to upper part of the Mount McRae Shale.","The absence of any diagnostic shallow-water sedimentary structures, combined with the presence of BIF, carbonate turbidites, and carbonaceous shale suggests that the Mount McRae Shale and Mount Sylvia Formation were deposited well below storm wave base in a pelagic to hemipelagic environment that was down-slope from a carbonate platform to the north and northeast. The top of the second BIF macroband in the Mount Sylvia Formation, informally designated SB2, is interpreted by KrapeÅ¾ et al. (2003) to mark a megasequence boundary that separates divergent margin deposits below from active/convergent margin deposits above.",,120,,"Both the lower and upper contacts of the Mount McRae Shale and Mount Sylvia Formation are sharp and conformable.

The Mount Newman Mining Company was the first to recognize the economic importance of this unit, primarily due to its lower phosphorous content compared to the Brockman Iron Formation. The Mount Newman Member is typically about 70-80 m thick and is comprised of distinctively podded banded iron-formation (BIF) interbedded with thin shale horizons. The shale horizons are distinctive in natural gamma-ray logs and are widely used for stratigraphic subdivision. There is only one crocidolite-bearing horizon recognized at the base of the member. The Mount Newman Member conformably overlies the MacLeod Member and, in turn, is conformably overlain by the West Angela Member at the base of the overlying Wittenoom Formation. Deposition took place between c. 2598 and 2597 Ma in a proximal ramp setting that passes into a deep-marine environment towards the southwest.","The Mount Newman Member is present throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region, where it is exposed on the 1:250 000 maps sheets YARRALOOLA, PYRAMID, WYLOO, MOUNT BRUCE, ROY HILL, BALFOUR DOWNS, TUREE CREEK, NEWMAN, and ROBERTSON and forms the uppermost unit of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation. The member is typically about 70-80 m thick, but is variable with a much reduced section recorded in the Chichester Range where a change to carbonate facies BIF makes identification of the constituent members of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation contentious (Lascelles 2000; Hurst et al., 2013).","The Mount Newman Member was named by Blockley et al. (1993) after Mount Newman (Zone 50, MGA 762000E 7424132N), a prominent peak in the Ophthalmia Range about 20 km northwest of Newman. The type section is defined as the core interval between 342.50 m and 419.65 m in drill hole DDH 275. No specific type area has been defined, but it is well exposed in a number of outcrops and in many exploration drill holes. The best outcrops are in Kungarra Gorge on the northern limb of the eastward extension of the Mount Wall Anticline (Zone 50, MGA 494411E 7478870N), in the Turner Syncline (Zone 50, MGA 544596E 7492540N), and in two gorges in the Wanna Munna Anticline (Zone 50, MGA 720749E 7445814N and Zone 50, MGA 719102E 7445727N), and in  Manganese Gorge  at the Marandoo mine (Blockley et al., 1993).   In addition to the formal stratigraphic nomenclature, the Mount Newman Member is divided into nine BIF macrobands and eight thin shale macrobands. The shale macrobands are distinctive in natural gamma-ray logs, thinner than those in the Dales Gorge Member of the Brockman Iron Formation, and from bottom to top are designated NS1 to NS8 (Blockley et al., 1993). The BIF macrobands are designated NB1 to NB9. In addition, three larger informal subdivisions consisting of both shale and BIF macrobands are also used by some mining companies (Kepert, 2018) and are designated N1 (NB1-NB3), N2 (NS3-NS6), and N3 (NB7-NB9). The Vivash Riebeckite Zone is the only crocidolite-bearing horizon in the Mount Newman Member, which extends from the basal contact to the base of NS2.",,"The Mount Newman Member is the most economically important subdivision of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation, since it is the major stratigraphic control to the bulk of the iron enrichment within the formation. The Mount Newman Mining Company was the first to recognize the economic importance of this unit, primarily due to its lower phosphorous content compared to the Brockman Iron Formation (Slepecki, 1981).   The Mount Newman Member consists of distinctively podded BIF interbedded with thin shale horizons. The BIF consists of closely spaced chert and iron oxide/iron silicate mesobands with well-developed microbanding in all mesobands types. Compared to the BIFs of the underlying Nammuldi and MacLeod Members, the Mount Newman Member is more iron-rich, more distinctly banded, with cream- to white-weathering chert as opposed to yellow-weathering chert. This colour difference reflects the significantly lower abundance of iron carbonates in the Mount Newman Member. Cherts within the BIF macrobands are strongly podded, imparting distinctive wavy bedding that is commonly referred to as  pinch-and-swell  structure. Pods may be either subparallel to bedding or else inclined in a manner reminiscent of the  cross-pods  in the Dales Gorge Member (Trendall and Blockley, 1970).   The eight defined shale macrobands are significantly thinner than those in the Dales Gorge Member of the Brockman Iron Formation, and additional very thin macrobands are not included in the numbering system. Shale macrobands consist of well-bedded, stilpnomelane-rich tuffaceous mudstone to siltstone, and some carbonate. They are generally not well exposed, except in steep-sided gorges where the 20-30 cm-thick NS5 is often the best exposed. A regionally persistent layer of 2-5 cm pyrite nodules that weather to form goethite or voids, is present in the middle of NS3 and can be recognized locally in outcrop (Kepert, 2018).","Lateral facies changes within the Mount Newman Member from carbonate- to silicate-rich between the Chichester and Hamersley Ranges is indicative of deposition in a proximal ramp setting (Hurst et al., 2013), passing into a deep-marine environment towards the southwest (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003; Pickard et al., 2004).",,80,,"The Mount Newman Member conformably overlies the MacLeod Member and, in turn, is conformably overlain by the West Angela Member at the base of the overlying Wittenoom Formation.

The contact with the overlying West Angela Member of the Wittenoom Formation is marked by a sharp contact between podded magnetite-bearing BIF (NB9), and shale or dolomitic shale that is commonly highly manganiferous in weathered outcrop.

Most samples from the intrusion contain 20-30% or more phenocrysts of round microperthite 1-3 cm (rarely up to 4 cm) in diameter, some of which have narrow rims of fine-grained sodic plagioclase in a chequerboard pattern.

The group is dominated by vitric rhyolitic flows and lesser pyroclastic falls and subvolcanic intrusions. It incorporates rocks previously assigned by Daniels (1974) to the Scamp and Palgrave volcanic associations. Minor siliciclastic rocks and basalt flows also occur. Conservative estimates on the age range for magmatic activity within the Talbot Sub-basin are between c. 1077 and c. 1047 Ma.","The Mesoproterozoic Bentley Supergroup (Daniels, 1974) comprises weakly to moderately deformed and metamorphosed bimodal volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks and fine- to coarse-grained sedimentary rocks, and unconformably overlies high-grade metamorphic rocks of the west Musgrave Province. The main outcrops of this unit define the Talbot Sub-basin in the region extending between Warburton to the west and Barrow Range (approximately 40 km southwest of Jameson Community) to the east. The Mount Palgrave Group is the stratigraphically lowest unit within that sub-basin and directly overlies, and has been intruded by, the subvolcanic and synvolcanic granites of the Winburn granite pluton. The volcanic rocks are well exposed in the area between Barrow Hill and Mount Eliza, in the eastern part of MOUNT EVELINE, and can be traced northwards to Mount Rawlinson (BENTLEY) and then sporadically northwestwards for approximately a further 20 km. They also outcrop in the vicinity of Bentley Hill, on the western side of BENTLEY, and at and to the north of Mount Waugh, in the northern part of MOUNT EVELINE. From there they form sparse outcrops to the west towards Scamp Hill, on GOLDEN POINT. On the northeastern part of BENTLEY, the Winburn granite separates the Mount Palgrave Group from the layered mafic Jameson intrusion of the Giles Suite (P_-WKG).","The name is derived from the topographical feature, Mount Palgrave, located in the central-northern part of the MOUNT EVELINE, approximately half way between the communities of Warburton and Jameson. Initially used as 'Palgrave volcanic association' by Daniels (1974), the name was amended to Mount Palgrave Group by Howard et al. (2011) but not defined. The Mount Palgrave Group contains the Eliza (base), Scamp, and Mount Waugh (top) Formations. This description constitutes the first full definition of the group.",,"Daniels (1974) divided the stratigraphy of the Bentley Supergroup into four main units: the Pussy Cat, Tollu, Cassidy, and Mission Groups. Outcrop of the Tollu Group is almost entirely restricted to an east-trending, synclinal structure (Blackstone Syncline and the Blackstone Sub-basin) south of BLACKSTONE, whereas the other groups are restricted to the region between Warburton to the west and the Barrow Range to the east, in what is referred to as the Talbot Sub-basin. In addition, Daniels (1974) recognized three regions dominated by felsic volcanic rocks, but also intruded by subvolcanic granite, called the Scamp, Palgrave, and Skirmish Hill volcanic associations. Each of these regions was thought to outline a fault-bounded caldera. Subsequent mapping redefined the Palgrave volcanic association as the Mount Palgrave Group, which underlies the Pussy Cat Group (Howard et al., 2011). Since then, the Mount Palgrave Group has been split. The upper part now forms the Kaarnka Group, comprising fine- to coarse-grained felsic volcaniclastic rocks, rhyolitic (and rarer dacitic) lavas, pyroclastic falls and flows and subvolcanic intrusions, and rare basalt flows. The lower part has been combined with rocks formerly assigned to the Scamp volcanic association, forming a redefined Mount Palgrave Group. This group mainly comprises vitric rhyolitic lavas (locally with very well developed spherulites, flow banding or perlitic fractures), pyroclastic falls and flows, and rare basalt lavas. It forms the oldest component of the Bentley Supergroup in the Talbot Sub-basin.  The Mount Palgrave Group contains the Eliza (base), Scamp, and Mount Waugh (top) Formations. The Eliza Formation is dominated by vitric rhyolitic lavas with locally very well developed spherulites, flow banding or perlitic fractures, and has an upper portion that includes non-rheomorphic, clast-rich ignimbrite. The Scamp Formation replaces the previously defined 'Scamp volcanic association' of Daniels (1974). This formation is typically more deformed than the Eliza Formation, although it was also likely dominated by spherulitic, flow banding or perlitic vitric rhyolite. The upper part of the Mount Palgrave Group, the Mount Waugh Formation, is only developed in the area to the north and west of the Kathleen Ignimbrite and comprises flow-banded rhyolite and associated fine- to coarse-grained volcaniclastic rocks.",,,,,"The Eliza Formation, at the base of the Mount Palgrave Group, has been intruded by synvolcanic subvolcanic granites of the Winburn granite pluton along the eastern exposure of the group. Although there is no clear angular discordance, the upper contact of the Mount Palgrave Group is either with diamictite of the Pussy Cat Group or fine- to coarse-grained volcaniclastic rocks of the Kaarnka Group.",,17,,,Mixed,2,,,,1077,,1047,,"An age of 1077 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 174662, Kirkland et al., 2010) was obtained from a weakly to moderately foliated granite unit of the Winburn granite pluton and was interpreted to be the age of igneous crystallization. It is, however, recognized that this pluton includes both pre- and synvolcanic granite intrusions. Several samples of the Mount Palgrave Group have given dates that have also been interpreted to be the age of igneous crystallization. These include 1070 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 194800; GSWA, preliminary data), 1069 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 195116; GSWA, preliminary data) and 1068 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 195114; GSWA, preliminary data) from the Eliza Formation, 1070 Â± 10 Ma (GSWA 195115; GSWA, preliminary data) and 1064 Â± 5 Ma (GSWA 195678; GSWA, preliminary data) from the Scamp Formation, and 1065 Â± 9 Ma (GSWA 195230; GSWA, preliminary data) from the Mount Waugh Formation. However, it is now recognized that all felsic igneous rocks of the Talbot Sub-basin include a large proportion of recycled cognate material (i.e. antecrysts). The unavoidable inclusion of these in the dated zircon samples means that all previously interpreted crystallization ages have likely been variably overestimated (i.e. true ages of volcanic deposition or intrusive crystallization should be younger). Smithies et al. (2013) suggested that the most conservative age range for magmatic activity within the Talbot Sub-basin is probably between c. 1077 and c. 1047 Ma although dating of individual zircons interpreted to be antecrysts indicates a maximum possible range from 1116 Â± 28 to 1010 Â± 20 Ma.",No,,,5,,No,Submitted,Yes,Yes,P_,PG,,,,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

The formation is faulted out at Wyarma Spring (Zone 50, MGA 524725E 7460646N) in the nose of the Hardey Syncline and is also absent in the vicinity of Seven Mile Creek (Zone 50, MGA 556776E 7432112N) (Trendall and Blockley, 1970).","The type locality and section of the Mount Sylvia Formation are at Mount Sylvia (Zone 50, MGA 561979E 7533671N), southwest of Hamersley Homestead (MacLeod et al., 1963). The formation is a relatively thin unit of shale, chert, dolomite, and BIF that forms a distinctive unit throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region. In particular the uppermost of three BIF beds is a conspicuous regional marker. It is informally known as  Bruno s band  and marks the top of the formation (Trendall and Blockley, 1970), along with two less commonly exposed BIF beds at the base that are colloquially referred to as  the tramlines  or the  twins  (Kepert, 2018).   An informal nomenclature, based on the macroband naming concept of Trendall and Blockley (1970), is used by mining companies to further subdivide the formation (Kepert, 2018). This naming system labels units according to their host unit, dominant macroband lithology, and stratigraphic position. Under this scheme, the BIF macrobands are designated SB1 to SB3 (Bruno s band).",,"The Mount Sylvia Formation is predominantly a recessive weathering unit exposed along the lower slopes beneath the steep cliffs of the Brockman Iron Formation. The unit consists of shale, chert, and dolomite and contains three distinctive beds of resistive BIF. The lowermost BIF bed is about 2 m thick and marks the base of the formation. It is separated from the second 3 m-thick BIF by about 5 m of shale. These lower two BIFs are more similar to those of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation, but generally lack well-developed pods and consist mainly of banded ferruginous chert (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). The second BIF is overlain by about 20 m of interbedded shale, chert, and carbonate turbidites. The uppermost BIF that defines the top of the formation is about 5 m thick and constitutes a well-microbanded BIF that more closely resembles that of the Dales Gorge Member. KrapeÅ¾ et al. (2003) document rare siliciclastic turbidites between the SB2 macroband and Bruno s band (SB3). The top of the SB2 macroband is also interpreted by these authors to mark a megasequence boundary that separates the divergent margin deposits below from active/convergent margin deposits above.","The absence of any diagnostic shallow-water sedimentary structures, combined with the presence of BIF and carbonate turbidites, suggests that the Mount Sylvia Formation was deposited well below storm wave base in a pelagic to hemipelagic environment that was down-slope from a carbonate platform.",,50,,"Both the lower and upper contacts of the Mount Sylvia Formation are sharp and conformable.

The minimum age is constrained by a 2504 Â± 5 Ma tuff bed in the overlying lower Mount McRae Shale (Rasmussen et al., 2005). There are no direct age constraints from within the Mount Sylvia Formation.

4648,78890,E-_mu-sm,1,Mu Formation,1,"Cobble to boulder conglomerate with predominantly sedimentary clasts and ferruginous, friable, sandy matrix; local red-brown sandstone and pebbly sandstone, and minor siltstone","The Mu Formation is a poorly exposed succession of conglomerate, minor sandstone and siltstone up to at least 600 m thick that lies with pronounced angular unconformity over older units of the Amadeus Basin, mainly in the Mu Hills area (southeast MACDONALD 1:250 000 scale map sheet). The unit is dominated by cobble and boulder conglomerate with mainly sedimentary or metasedimentary clasts (silicified sandstone, metasandstone, quartzite, minor chert and vein quartz). The ferruginous sandstone matrix is very friable and rarely exposed; most outcrops are of loose rounded cobbles and boulders. This facies of the Mu Formation closely resembles the Sir Frederick Conglomerate, from which many of the clasts were probably reworked. The matrix, where exposed, is generally more ferruginous than the Sir Frederick Conglomerate. Other local facies include red-brown sandstone and pebbly sandstone, and minor siltstone. The age of deposition is poorly constrained, but it is inferred to be early Cambrian, deposited during the end phase of the 580-520 Ma Petermann Orogeny in local sub-basins created by salt movement. The unit was previously mapped as Ligertwood beds (Wells et al., 1964; Wells, 1968), but that formation, defined in the Northern Territory (NT), is considered to be much younger.","Most outcrops of the Mu Formation are distributed along the northern edge of the Mu Hills. Isolated outcrops of conglomerate up to 20 km northeast of the type area may belong to the Mu Formation. Outcrops previously mapped as Ligertwood beds near the western edge of the MOUNT RENNIE 1:250 000 map sheet area in the NT are probably Mu Formation (but the Ligertwood beds type area further east is excluded). Outcrops of cobble and boulder conglomerate near PWHROB000017 (MGA Zone 52 437577E 7295782N) south of Wallace Hills (central RAWLINSON 1:250 000 map sheet area) were previously mapped as Sir Frederick Conglomerate (Well et al., 1964). However, the location of these outcrops suggests that they overly the Maurice Formation, although the contact is covered; if correct they may be outliers of Mu Formation. Alternatively, they are Sir Frederick Conglomerate in fault contact with Maurice Formation. On present evidence these outcrops are  tentatively included in the Mu Formation.","The Mu Formation is named after Mu Hills in the southeast of the MACDONNALD 1:250 000 map sheet area. The type locality is on the northern edge of the Mu Hills in the vicinity of the Sandy Blight Junction Track (Haines et al., 2015). Outcrop is generally poor and discontinuous, so no single type section can be nominated. The conglomeratic facies is best exposed around PWHMUH000008 (MGA Zone 52 486484E 7360048N), where it unconformable overlies poorly exposed and silicified Bitter Springs Group exposed to the south. This location is also the basal stratotype. The sandstone facies is best exposed in a small cluster of hills around PWHMUH000003 (MGA Zone 52 488437E 7362349N). Access to the type area is via the Sandy Blight Junction Track. Most outcrops of Mu Formation were previously mapped as Ligertwood beds by Wells et al. (1964) and Wells (1968). However, these outcrops are now inferred to be distinct from, and significantly older than the unit exposed at the Ligertwood beds type locality in the NT (Ligertwood beds at type area is inferred to be upper Paleozoic, post-dating the Alice Springs Orogeny: Edgoose, 2013). Some outcrops previously mapped as Ligertwood beds in WA are now assigned to Bitter Springs Formation diapiric carbonate breccia and Sir Frederick Conglomerate. The thickest exposure of at least 600 m is inferred in the type area. Significant thickness variations are expected due to the tectonic setting, but cannot be quantified due to poor and discontinuous outcrop. In isolation the conglomeratic facies is difficult to distinguish from the older Sir Frederick Conglomerate (although the Mu Formation conglomerate matrix is often more ferruginous), while the sandstone facies resembles sandstone units in the Maurice Formation and Sir Frederick Conglomerate. It is only possible to confidently distinguish the Mu Formation where the pronounced basal angular unconformity over the older units can be recognised.",,"The dominant lithofacies of the Mu Formation is cobble and boulder conglomerate. Sandstone with interbeds of conglomeratic sandstone is locally present, and siltstone is a minor component. Conglomerate clasts are well-rounded and are mostly of sedimentary and metasedimentary lithologies including quartzite, silicified sandstone, metasandstone, with minor chert and vein quartz. Many of the conglomerate clasts may be reworked from the locally underlying Sir Frederick Conglomerate. The sandy matrix is often ferruginous and is typically very friable, with many exposures dominated by loose rounded cobbles and boulders at surface. The sandstone is typically red-brown, medium-grained, lithic, and often pebbly. Beds are typically massive, with current lineations common on bedding surfaces. The conglomeratic facies is the most regionally widespread expression of the unit. The sandstone facies is only well developed around the type area.","The Mu Formation is inferred to have been deposited under alluvial fan and fluvial environments based on sedimentary facies. Deposition in the Mu Hills area was controlled by local uplift and subsidence likely related to diapiric movement of Bitter Springs Group salt, probably during a late phase of the Petermann Orogeny. The Mu Formation appears to fill local mini-basins related to salt withdrawal. The formation was tilted by continuing salt movements during deposition. The sediment was ultimately derived from uplift of the Petermann Orogen, but was at least in part recycled from earlier syn-Petermann deposits such as the Sir Frederick Conglomerate.",600,,,"The Mu Formation unconformably overlies Maurice Formation, Sir Frederick Conglomerate, Carnegie Formation and Bitter Springs Group.

The youngest detrital zircon from GSWA Sample 199419 yields a 207-corrected  238 U/ 206 Pb* date of 631 Â± 15 Ma (1&sigma;), providing a maximum depositional age for the unit. However, this is significantly older than the maximum age that can be inferred from geological relationships. The formation unconformably overlies and is thus younger than the Maurice Formation, which is probably of early Cambrian age (Haines et al., 2012, 2015). It was probably deformed prior to the middle Ordovician because nearly flat-lying middle Ordovician calcarenite (informal unit O-LA-kla) is exposed nearby (Haines et al., 2012). Detrital zircon geochronology is consistent with sediment derivation from the Petermann Orogen during or after the late Ediacaran to early Cambrian (580-520 Ma) Petermann Orogeny (Haines et al., 2015).

It is preserved on COONABILDIE and CARNEGIE, and extends eastward beneath Phanerozoic and Neoproterozoic rocks. It was deposited in a coastal setting, with environments ranging from a muddy inner shelf with isolated sandy megaripples, through foreshore, beach and possibly tidal sandflat environments, to a washover lagoonal setting. Bunting (1986) considered the lower boundary was probably disconformable, but it is here regarded as probably transitional out of the Kulele Limestone based on the limited exposures across or near the contact. The formation may be up to about 200 m maximum preserved thickness, rather than the 100 m estimated by Bunting.  The youngest zircons in a sample from near the base of the Mulgarra Sandstone on COONABILDIE yielded a U-Pb SHRIMP maximum depositional age of ca 1.8 Ga (Halilovic et al., 2004), although Sheppard et al. (in press) considered a more rigorous examination of this data yielded a maximum age constraint of 1867 +/- 25 Ma.","The Mulgarra Sandstone is preserved only at the exposed eastern end of the Earaheedy Basin, in the central core of the basin north of Lake Carnegie. It undoubetedly continues eastwards under younger Proterozoic and Phanerozoic cover. The deposited top is not preserved, and Bunting (1986) estimated the Mulgarra Sandstone was about 100 m thick, but we consider that at least 200 m stratigraphic thickness is exposed in the syncline north of Mulgarra Pool.","The Mulgarra Sandstone (Hall et al., 1977, Hall and Goode, 1978; Bunting, 1986) is the youngest component of the Miningarra Group. It is named after Mulgarra Pool, a small pool on the northeast margin of Lake Carnegie. The type section is in the Timperley Range about 22 km east of Mt Hoskin, but only the lower part is reasonably to well exposed (Bunting, 1986) and the section has not been measured. The formation was shown on previous mapsheets as  P_Em .",,"The Mulgarra Sandstone consists of fine- to medium-grained, commonly glauconitic sandstone, siltstone, shale and minor carbonate. Locally, there are intercalations of thin limestone beds, forming a mixed unit up to 40 m thick, and quartzose calcarenite horizons are widespread. Siltstone is widespread, and a significant component of the formation, but rarely outcrops. Some sand units are discrete megaripples totally enclosed by siltstone, and clearly formed as isolated sand-starved megripples on mudflats or an inner shelf. The Mulgarra Sandstone is quite similar to the Wongawol Formation, but for the presence of fine- to medium-grained glauconitic sandstone. Sedimentary structures such as rippled surfaces, in places composed of highly asymmetric, low amplitude small ripples, adhesion surfaces, and wrinkled surfaces point to very shallow conditions with intermittent emergence.    The main scarp of the Timperley Range, northeast of Mt Hoskin, exposes the basal 20 m of the formation, where it consists of interbedded fine-grained and coarse-grained felspathic quartz arenite, locally ferruginous, and bedded on a 100-200 mm scale. Coarser grained intervals are glauconitic. Both cross bedding and parallel bedding with primary current lineation are present, together with ripples indicative of very shallow water. Flute and load casts, and ball-and-pillow structures are present near the base. Bunting (1986) noted the basal contact with the underlying Kulele Limestone is sharp and marked by 1-2 m of shale. From our reconnaissance, the contact appears to be gradational, with limestone beds gradually decreasing upwards while siltstone and fine-grained sandstone increase.  Based on Haliliovic et al's (2004) data, Sheppard et al. (2016) noted the provenance of the Mulgara Sandstone appeared to be different to all underlying units in the Earaheedy Basin. They agreed that the sharp contact with the Kulele Limestone noted by Bunting (1986) might indicate a pronounced hiatus, and speculated that the Mulgarra Sandstone might be the product of another, later, depositional phase. Our preference for a gradational contact negates that suggestion, but not Sheppard et al's (2016) related suggestion that deposition of the Mulgara Sandstone may have been caused by the onset of the Capricorn Orogeny to the west, at about 1820 Ma.","Sedimentary structures and bedforms indicate the Mulgarra Sandstone was deposited in a coastal setting to inner shelf, with environments ranging from a muddy inner shelf with isolated sandy megaripples, through foreshore, beach and possibly tidal sandflat environments, to a washover lagoonal setting. The widespread presence of glauconite confirms a marine environment. Adhesion surfaces, blowouts and wrinkled surfaces suggest intermittent emergence and exposure, and widespread sediment loading structures indicate continued sporadic earthquakes. Compared to the Kulele Limestone, the environment was shallower overall with greater terrigenous influx.",100,200,,"The Mulgarra Sandstone is apparently conformable on the Kulele Limestone. Bunting (1986) noted the basal contact with the underlying Kulele Limestone was sharp and marked by 1-2 m of shale. From our reconnaissance along the Timperley Range to near Buljah Pool (KINGSTON 1:250 000), the contact appears to be gradational, with limestone beds gradually decreasing upwards while siltstone and fine-grained sandstone increase.  Its stratigraphic top is nowhere exposed, instead there is a disconformity or slight angular unconformity with late Paleozoic glacigene rocks.",,17,,,,4,,,,1867,25,1650,,"The youngest zircons in a sample from near the base of the Mulgarra Sandstone on COONABILDIE yielded a U-Pb SHRIMP maximum depositional age of 1808 +/- 36 Ma (Halilovic et al., 2004), but Sheppard et al. (2016) doubted the validity of the analytical data, and considered a more likely maximum depositional age to be 1867+/- 25 Ma, based on more rigorous screening of data.  A minimum age is provided by the age of micas generated by deformation of the Earaheedy Basin succession, on RHODES (Pirajno et al., 2009). Sheppard et al. (2016) raised the possibility that ages of c. 1815 Ma for authigenic monazite in the Yelma Formation (Muhling et al., 2012) might reflect fluid flow during deformation of the entire Earaheedy Basin succession, rather than fluid associated solely with mineralization of the Yelma Formation as Muhling et al. suggested. This suggestion was also favoured by Occhipinti et al. (written comm. 2017), on regional grounds. In this scenario, deposition of the Mulgarra Sandstone may be related to the onset of the Capricorn Orogeny to the west, at about 1820 Ma.

It was deposited as wave and current worked rhodoliths in deeper, possibly warmer, water than the remainder of the onshore Nullarbor Limestone. The preserved extent is centred on Madura, extends west to Twilight Cove and east to Wilson Bluff, and has been eroded on much of the Roe Plain, south of Madura.   ","The Mullamullang Member of the Nullarbor Limestone is present in the southern central part of the onshore Eucla Basin, centred on Madura and extending west to Twilight Cove and east to Wilson Bluff. O'Connell (2011) attributed the distribution to accumulation of rhodolith gravels seaward of and at depths greater than where sea-grass banks flourished, nearer the basin margins. The maximum thickness recorded by Lowry (1970) is 59 ft (18 m), midway between Madura and Twilight Cove. It has been removed by post-Miocene erosion over much of the Roe Plain. ","The Mullamullang Limestone Member was introduced by Lowry (1968) and fully described by Lowry (1970). James and Bone (1991) simply referred to the Mullamullang Member, and Drexel and Priess (1995) formally simplified the name to Mullamullang Member. The type section is in Mullamullang Cave, a doline northeast of Madura, and is 21 feet (6.4 m) thick, between 37 and 58 feet (11.3 and 17.7 m) below the level of the surrounding plateau (Lowry, 1970). It is a microbial nodular limestone that forms a widespread biostrome at the base of the Nullarbor Limestone",,"The Mullamullang Member consists of pink to yellow nodules, or rhodoliths, of microbial limestone set in a bioclastic calcarenite matrix. The matrix is composed largely of foraminifers and calcareous algae, both whole and as abraded fragments.","The Mullamullang Member developed as a widespread microbial biostrome at the base of the Nullarbor Limestone in the central Eucla Basin. Due to its lateral uniformity, Lowry (1970) suggested it developed on a calm shelf at depths of about 15 to 30 m, shallower and more energetic than the remainder of the Nullarbor Limestone. In contrast, O'Connell (2011) interpreted the nodules in the member as rhodoliths, deposited as widespread variably reworked rhodolith gravels in warm waters at depths up to about 100 m with occasional strong wave or current action to overturn the rhodoliths, seaward of and deeper than other onshore facies of the Nullarbor Limestone.",,18,,,,17,,,,5,,,,16,,14,,,No,,,1,,No,DE in Progress,No,No,NM,EUnp,,,,,MIGSDRH,2.02E+13,,No,No

It contains enclaves of Melita Formation (A-GIm-xfr-b) greenstones and the Niagara Igneous Complex (A-_ni-om) but contacts are typically deformed and may be both tectonic and intrusive. Witt (1994) argued that granitic dykes that intrude rocks of the c. 2683 Ma Melita Formation near granite-greenstone contacts are related to the Mulliberry Granite.","The Mulliberry Granite is mapped on southeastern MELITA, northeastern MENZIES, and southwestern YERILLA. ","This Mulliberry Granite, formerly the Mulliberry Granitoid Complex of Witt (1994), is named after Mulliberry Well at Zone 51, MGA 343830E 6741975N. According to Witt (1994), there are good exposures south of the breakaways near Niagara Dam (Zone 51, MGA 347585E 6746195N). This is taken to be the type area.",,"The Mulliberry Granite includes foliated biotite monzogranite and granodiorite, with local concentrations of microgranitic dykes and enclaves of various rock types (Witt, 1994; Witt and Davy, 1997). The granitic rocks are medium grained and K-feldspar is typically interstitial to quartz and plagioclase. Synplutonic dykes and enclaves of fine-grained, weakly porphyritic tonalite contain up about 15% biotite. Accessory minerals include magnetite, ilmenite, zircon, titanite and apatite (Witt, 1994).  Champion and Cassidy (2002) have assigned some granite within this unit to their high-Ca Menangina Association on the basis of limited geochemistry from west of Morapoi homestead (Zone 51, MGA 342600E 6746220N) and southeast of Mount Niagara (Zone 51, MGA 351950E 6749190N).   The Mulliberry Granite contains inclusions of the Melita Formation (A-GIm-xfr-b) and Niagara Igneous Complex (A-_ni-om); syenogranite, granodiorite and monzogranite plutons (A-gr-Y, A-xgm-gg-Y, A-gmb-Y); sedimentary rocks including sandstone and conglomerate (A-ss-YEG); dolerite (A-od-YEG); and mafic to intermediate gneiss (A-mwa-YEG). Some may represent inclusions of older rocks, while others may intrude the Mulliberry Granite. Contacts are typically deformed, commonly poorly exposed and not well documented.   Witt (1994) stated that the northern contact between the Mulliberry Granite and Melita Formation is associated with a northerly trending dyke swarm of porphyritic microgranite (A-gnpq-Y, A-gnph-Y). Some dykes can be traced into the granitic complex, but most intrude the greenstones and terminate at the contact with the Mulliberry Granite. Most dykes display deformed margins and some display evidence of folding. According to Witt (1994), the Mulliberry Granite was emplaced into the greenstones during a regional doming event early in the deformation history.

5,75924,P_-MGm-mtsf,4,Mumba Psammite,1,Quartzofeldspathic psammitic schist commonly with chloritoid; local minor pelitic schist and quartzite,"The Mumba Psammite (P_-MGm-mtsf, P_-MGm-mls, and P_-MGm-mtq) is a series of psammitic and pelitic schists and quartzites that form three main west-east to northwest-southeast trending belts within the Paradise, Mooloo, Mutherbukin, and Limejuice Zones. The schists and quartzites are variably tectonically interleaved and folded with basement gneisses of the Halfway Gneiss. The southerly belt is dominated by pelitic schist and retrogressed pelitic diatexite (P_-MGm-mls), with subordinate psammitic schist and quartzite. The central belt is dominated by quartzofeldspathic psammitic schist (P_-MGm-mtsf), with subordinate pelitic schist and quartzite, whereas the northern belt is dominated by massive recrystallized quartzite (P_-MGm-mtq) with subordinate quartzofeldspathic psammitic schist. The quartzofeldspathic psammitic schist member (P_-MGm-mtsf) comprises quartz-sericite-feldspar-albite-chloritoid(-chlorite) schist and chloritoid-chlorite-sericite-quartz-feldspar-albite(-garnet) schist, although a few transitional rock types are present. Compositional layering representative of bedding is locally preserved, especially on southern YINNETHARRA, where the schists appear to be unconformable upon the Halfway Gneiss. Detrital zircon dating indicates that this unit was deposited sometime after c. 2240 Ma but before the growth of metamorphic zircon and monazite during a metamorphic event of unknown grade at c. 2125 Ma. The Mumba Psammite was deposited as a result of uplift during the Ophthalmia Orogeny to the north, and was sourced directly from the underlying Halfway Gneiss, as well as from various litholgies along the southern Pilbara margin. Subsequent low-grade metamorphism, presumably during the Capricorn Orogeny, overprinted the schists, downgrading and pseudomorphing high-grade minerals with lower grade equivalents.","The Mumba Psammite (P_-MGm-mtsf, P_-MGm-mls, and P_-MGm-mtq) is distributed within the Paradise, Mooloo, Mutherbukin and Limejuice Zones as three main west-east to northwest-southeast trending belts that are variably tectonically interleaved and folded with basement gneisses of the Halfway Gneiss. The southern belt forms a 30 km-long series of outcrops on DAURIE CREEK and GLENBURGH, centred on and around Mount Dalgety, and comprises mainly pelitic schist and retrogressed pelitic diatexite (P_-MGm-mls) with minor psammitic schist (P_-MGm-mtsf) and quartzite (P_-MGm-mtq). The central belt is roughly 40 km long and straddles the southern parts of LOCKIER and YINNETHARRA, and the northern parts of DAURIE CREEK and GLENBURGH, and is composed mainly of chloritoid-bearing psammitic schists and quartzofeldspathic psammitic schists with minor pelitic schist, retrogressed pelitic diatexite, and quartzite. The northern belt, which is truncated by the Ti Tree Shear Zone, forms a discontinuous train of outcrops some 150 km long on the northern parts of LOCKIER and YINNETHARRA, and central and southern parts of PINK HILLS and CANDOLLE. Apart from the most southerly outcrops of psammitic schist on PINK HILLS, the belt comprises predominantly massive recrystallized quartzite with very minor interbeds of psammitic schist. Thin, discontinuous strips of psammitic and pelitic schist and quartzite lie within the Chalba Shear Zone and farther north on MOUNT SANDIMAN, where they are tectonically interleaved with leucocratic gneisses of the Halfway Gneiss. The Mumba Psammite forms rocky strike ridges and hills up to 500 m high; the highest ridges are defined by outcrops of quartzite. The Mumba Psammite is characterized in aerial photographs by rugged, deep-red weathering patterns.","The name Mumba Pelite was first defined by Occhipinti and Sheppard (2001) for a belt of metapelitic rocks which also included minor psammitic schist and quartzite on the GLENBURGH 1:100 000 sheet. This belt of rock also continues onto DAURIE CREEK. Subsequent mapping on YINNETHARRA, LOCKIER, PINK HILLS, and CANDOLLE has revealed that these siliciclastic rocks form three subparallel belts with psammitic schist forming the major and dominant lithology; hence the original name of Mumba Pelite has been altered to Mumba Psammite in order to better reflect the dominant rock type in the unit.",,"Psammitic schist and chloritoid-bearing psammitic schist are most abundant north of the Dalgety Fault within the central belt of the Mumba Psammite, but also forms centimetre- to metre-thick interbeds within pelitic schists in the southern belt and within quartzites of the northern belt. There are two main rock types: quartz-sericite-feldspar-albite-chloritoid(-chlorite) schist and chloritoid-chlorite-sericite-quartz-feldspar-albite(-garnet) schist, although a few transitional rock types are present. In outcrop, both rock types commonly show a millimetre- or centimetre-scale compositional layering that contains a subparallel fabric, which is folded by the regional F 1n  folds of the Capricorn Orogeny. Quartz-sericite-feldspar-albite-chloritoid(-chlorite) schist is pale green when fresh or red-brown when weathered. Chloritoid comprises about 10-15% of these rocks, commonly forming  clots  or  clusters , or small (<1.5 mm long) dark-green to black chloritoid porphyroblasts. The chloritoid is commonly aligned in the foliation, but also forms randomly oriented porphyroblasts that overprint the foliation, which is most commonly defined by sericite and chlorite. Locally, chloritoid porphyroblasts are enclosed by the foliation. Chloritoid-chlorite-sericite-quartz-feldspar-albite(-garnet) schists are dark green on fresh surfaces, with a reddish brown exterior. The rocks commonly have a  knobbly  appearance due to knots of fine-grained sericite up to 1 cm in diameter, which are enclosed by the foliation. A few of the sericite knots contain relict orthoclase. Chloritoid comprises 30% or more of these rocks, forming randomly oriented porphyroblasts that overprint the foliation, which is commonly defined by chlorite and sericite. Garnet is rare, forming colourless xenoblastic crystals in a few samples. Rutile and apatite are accessory minerals. In both rock types, feldspar shows various degrees of alteration; it is replaced by sericite. All of these rocks are interbedded with pelitic units that locally preserve diatexite textures indicating that migmatization and melting was a function of composition, because the psammitic rocks would have experienced similar high-temperature conditions but did not melt.",,,,,"Quartzofeldspathic schist and chloritoid-bearing schist (P_-MGm-mtsf) are most prominent within the central belt that straddles northern GLENBURGH, and southern LOCKIER and YINNETHARRA, but also occurs as a significant southwest-northeast   trending unit within the northern belt on central PINK HILLS. These rocks nearly always form tight to isoclinal upright infolds within basement gneisses of the Halfway Gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgn, AP_-_ha-mgnl, and AP_-_ha-mgnw), cross-cutting the gross-scale lithological variation in this gneissic basement. Thin strips and lenses are also folded and tectonically interleaved with the leucocratic Halfway Gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgnl) in the Chalba Shear Zone. However, on the southern part of YINNETHARRA at SPJYIN000284, near-horizontal bedding suggests that the psammitic schist sits unconformably on mesocratic Halfway Gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgnw). Within the southern and northern belts, quartzofeldspathic psammitic schist is interbedded on the cm-scale with the pelitic schist and quartzite members of the Mumba Psammite. The psammitic schists are intruded by various granitic sheets and stocks of the Moorarie Supersuite, including the Scrubber Granite (P_-MOsc-gm), Dumbie Granodiorite (P_-MOdu-ggp), and Rubberoid Granite (P_-MOru-mgm). On southern YINNETHARRA, the psammitic schists are intruded by metre- to decametre-scale sheets of medium-grained to pegmatitic leucocratic metamonzogranite (P_-MO-gmvl). On PINK HILLS, thin strips of quartzite lie within the Ti Tree Shear Zone and are in tectonic contact with various metagranitic and metasedimentary units, including P_-MO-mgnl, P_-LS-mhs, and P_-MO-xmg-m. South of Clever Mary Hills, quartzites are in faulted contact with low- to medium-grade Edmund Group rocks, including P_-MEk-s. The southwest-northeast trending belts of psammitic schists contain a thin unit, up to 100 m-wide, of medium-grained recrystallized quartzite (P_-MGm-mtq) that forms an eastward-thinning extension of the main quartzite units of the Clever Mary Hills.",,17,,,,4,,,,2240,8,2125,5,"Detrital zircon and metamorphic zircon and monazite from nine samples of the Mumba Psammite have been dated using SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology. Representative samples were collected from the Paradise, Mooloo, and Mutherbukin Zones, although only samples GSWA 183275, 184160, and 164333 (central and northern zones) are psammitic schists belonging to the P_-MGm-mtsf member of the Mumba Psammite. The geochronological information obtained from the other samples is described in detail under their relevant lithological units. Samples GSWA 183275 and 184160 were collected for detrital zircon dating and sample GSWA 164333 was selected for in situ monazite dating. The results are also summarized in Johnson et al. (2011).  Samples GSWA 183275 (51 analyses) and GSWA 184160 (64 analyses) both yielded abundant detrital zircons with  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* dates of 3163-2240 Ma, and included significant age components at c. 3000 Ma, c. 2700 Ma, c. 2500 Ma, and 2380-2300 Ma. The youngest detrital zircons in GSWA 183275 (Kirkland et al., 2009) are represented by a group of four analyses that indicate a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 2306 Â± 12 Ma. There were no metamorphic zircon overgrowths present in this sample.  The youngest detrital zircon core in GSWA 184160 (Wingate et al., 2010) indicated a  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 2240 Â± 8 Ma. A more conservative estimate of the maximum depositional age is provided by the next youngest 26 analyses, which indicate a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 2485 Â± 3 Ma. This sample also contained abundant zircon overgrowths interpreted to be of metamorphic origin based on their textural characteristics, uranium contents, and Th/U ratios. Of 13 zircon rims dated, seven analyses yielded a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1928 Â± 7 Ma, and six analyses yielded  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* dates of 1880-1795 Ma. The older date is interpreted as the age of high-grade metamorphism during the D2g event of the Glenburgh Orogeny, which is dated elsewhere between 1965-1950 Ma (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011). This result also provides a minimum age for deposition of the protolith of the psammitic schist. The younger dates of 1880-1795 Ma are interpreted to reflect loss of radiogenic Pb, possibly at about 1800 Ma.  Sample GSWA 164333, a chloritoid psammitic schist from the central belt of Mumba Psammite rocks, contained abundant monazite within chloritoid porphyroblasts (pseudomorphing garnet) and within the matrix. The monazite grains were variably altered around their margins to mixtures of Fe-oxide minerals and REE minerals. The least-altered grains yielded a concordant  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1947 Â± 6 Ma, and those representing increasing degrees of alteration indicated  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* dates ranging from c. 1950 to c. 1840 Ma. The c. 1950 Ma result is interpreted as the age of high-grade metamorphism that affected the psammitic schist (porphyroblasts of garnet grew during this event) whereas the younger dates are interpreted to indicate recrystallization and Pb-loss from monazite during low-grade overprinting (pseudomorphing of garnet with chloritoid) some time after c. 1840 Ma. The age of high-grade metamorphism at c. 1950 Ma is consistent with results from other samples dated here and from other units of the Mumba Psammite.  The best constraint for the minimum depositional age for the whole Mumba Psammite package is taken from sample GSWA 164369 (P_-MGm-mls) that contains metamorphic zircon and monazite that grew during an event at c. 2125 Ma, implying that the sediment was deposited by this time.",No,,,3,,No,Published,No,No,P_,MGm,,,,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,No,No

The unit also forms xenoliths within the basal parts of the layered Blackstone intrusion, both along the northern foothills of Blackstone Range (HOLT) and within and immediately north of the Jameson Range (FINLAYSON). Metamorphosed Mummawarrawarra Basalt outcrops are exposed on DIORITE, 9.5 km west-southwest of Wanarn. The Mummawarrawarra Basalt conformably overlies sedimentary rocks of the MacDougall Formation, the oldest unit of the Kunmarnara Group, and was intruded by the layered mafic intrusive rocks of the Giles Suite at c. 1075 Ma. The basalt unit of the Mummawarrawarra Basalt comprises a stack of 1-5 m-thick flow units. They range in composition from basaltic to andesitic, most being basaltic andesite. The layers range from massive and nonamygdaloidal to very amygdaloidal, and from nonporphyritic to rocks containing up to 5% euhedral plagioclase phenocrysts and glomerocrysts, both up to 6 mm in size. Abundant garnet porphyroblasts are present in Mummawarrawarra Basalt samples on DIORITE. This metamorphic event is interpreted to result from the 580-520 Ma Petermann Orogeny.","The main outcrops of the Mummawarrawarra Basalt are found on BLACKSTONE and COOPER. On the western side of BLACKSTONE, the unit forms an east-trending outcrop immediately east of the Cavenagh Range. On the eastern side of BLACKSTONE it forms the main part of MacDougall Bluff and Mummawarrawarra Hill. The unit is well exposed on and south of Mount Blyth in the central parts of COOPER. The Mummawarrawarra Basalt also outcrops on the western side of BELL ROCK, forming a series of hills approximately 10-15 km to the south of the western end of BELL ROCK Range. Rounded to elongate xenoliths of Mummawarrawarra Basalt are enclosed within the basal parts of the layered Blackstone intrusion (a mafic intrusion representing the earliest phase of the Giles Suite). Both are situated along the northern foothills of the Blackstone Range (HOLT), and within and immediately north of the Jameson Range (FINLAYSON). Small scattered outcrops of metamorphosed Mummawarrawarra Basalt are also present on DIORITE, 9.5 km west-southwest of Wanarn.","This unit was named by Daniels (1974) after the Mummawarrawarra Hill, located 24 km east of the Bell Rock Range.",,"The Mummawarrawarra Basalt consists of a stack of flow units, each 1-5 m thick, which range in composition from basaltic to andesitic, most being basaltic andesite. The layers range from massive and nonamygdaloidal to very amygdaloidal, and from nonporphyritic to rocks, containing up to 5% euhedral plagioclase phenocrysts and glomerocrysts, both up to 6 mm in size. The outcrop at MacDougall Bluff also includes layers of well-bedded andesitic tuff, containing rounded inclusions of amygdaloidal lava. The estimated thickness of the sequence at MacDougall Bluff is about 1100 m.  Where the rocks are amygdaloidal, the quartz-epidote-calcite-filled amygdales range in size up to 2 cm, and vary in shape from spheroidal to examples that have been flattened parallel to flow layering. Pipe vesicles (amygdales) are locally present and measure up to 15 cm in length. Amygdales have also locally coalesced to form pockets or layers parallel to flow layering. Strong epidote alteration is a very common feature of the Mummawarrawarra Basalt.  A small, fault-bounded outcrop lies immediately northeast of the Cavenagh Range. Here, the unit is lithologically diverse and locally consists of amygdaloidal basalt with up to 50% amygdales. It also includes feathery to granophyric-textured and weakly vesicular gabbro, which grades continuously to vesicular acicular-textured basalt, and then to tuffaceous rocks, containing accretionary lapilli (RHSMUG001290, Zone 52, MGA405162E 7101695N). In this area, the unit also includes doleritic layers, containing a randomly oriented framework of small (~1 mm) plagioclase laths with ~30% intergranular clinopyroxene.  In the area east of Cavenagh Range, the Mummawarrawarra Basalt was locally intruded by abundant dolerite and gabbro sills, particularly in the margins of layered mafic Giles Suite intrusions, such as the Cavenagh Range intrusion, forming a mixed unit (P_-KRm-xmb-mo).  In thin section, samples of the Mummawarrawarra Basalt from MacDougall Bluff are usually fine-grained, hypocrystalline, and seriate-textured, comprising 40-50% acicular to lath-shaped plagioclase crystals (heavily altered to epidote, chlorite, and carbonate), ~20% relict clinopyroxene crystals (some phenocrysts), rare olivine phenocrysts, 10-20% interstitial glassy groundmass (commonly with plagioclase needles, and now altered to epidote, quartz, and chlorite), and lobate amygdales (now consisting of quartz, epidote, and chlorite). Samples collected from locations closer to the Cavenagh Range are more typically actinolite-rich, rather than epidote-altered. They comprise a fine-grained, feathery-textured assemblage of acicular to lath-shaped plagioclase, partially enclosed in a mass of actinolite. The actinolite has replaced primary clinopyroxene and interstitial glass. The primary texture was seriate to porphyritic or glomeroporphyritic, with plagioclase phenocrysts up to 7 mm in size.  A sample taken from outcrop immediately northeast of the Cavenagh Range (GSWA 185634 at RHSMUG001272, Zone 52, MGA405227E 7101763N), consists of a massive, unfoliated, fine- to medium-grained rock, with rare, rounded, quartz-filled amygdales up to 3 mm in size. This rock contains stumpy to lath-shaped plagioclase crystals (~40%) up to 3 mm in size, forming an interlocking framework. Olivine (~15%), which is most likely to have crystallized before plagioclase, forms rounded to subhedral crystals, and is partly to totally altered to serpentine. Clinopyroxene (~15%) is an intergranular mineral, but also commonly subophitically encloses plagioclase, and is partially altered to actinolite. Opaque minerals form ~10% of the rock and are also intergranular. An intergranular groundmass (10-20%) is hypocrystalline and consists of acicular plagioclase and clinopyroxene with common micro-amygdales less than 1mm in size.

Most of the dykes strike between north and north-northeast and are up to 150 m wide, although most are less than 25 m wide. Thicker dykes may be traced along strike for tens of kilometres. The dykes overwhelmingly comprise dolerite, but in places granitic rocks are present. The suite has been dated using SHRIMP U-Pb zircon and baddeleyite geochronology at 755 Â± 3 Ma.","Dykes of the Mundine Well Dolerite strike north to north-northeast throughout the western part of the Capricorn Orogen, in the Pinjarra Orogen, and in the western parts of the Pilbara and Yilgarn Cratons. In the Gascoyne Province, the suite forms dense swarms on BOOLALOO, MANGAROON, MAROONAH, UAROO, TOWERA, LYNDON and MOUNT SANDIMAN, and on the central part of YINNETHARRA.  The dolerite dykes are commonly about 5-25 m wide but some reach nearly 150 m wide. They are commonly marked by sparse vegetation and typically outcrop as fresh boulders and tors amongst weathered rubble. Some of the dykes can be traced for 30 km or more. In the southwestern corner of MANGAROON, the dolerites outcrop as boulders and tors in narrow linear valleys bounded by low ridges of contact-metamorphosed granite.",Hickman and Lipple (1978) referred to a suite of east-northeast trending dolerite dykes in the Pilbara region as the Mundine Well Suite. This suite was subsequently referred to as the Mundine Well dyke swarm by Wingate and Giddings (2000). The name has now been formalized as the Mundine Well Dolerite.,,"Almost all of the dykes are composed of dolerite. The dykes are fine-grained, or fine- to medium-grained, and aphyric to weakly porphyritic (<5% plagioclase phenocrysts up to 10 mm long). The cores of thicker dykes are typically medium grained. The dykes are massive, but locally a spaced cleavage parallel to the dyke walls is present. The dolerites have a subophitic to intergranular texture, and comprise pale-brown augite and plagioclase, and lesser olivine (<10%) and titanomagnetite. Accessory minerals include interstitial quartz, biotite, and apatite, and brown hornblende rims on titanaugite. Low-grade metamorphic recrystallization includes minor epidote and sericite replacement of plagioclase, and iddingsite replacement of olivine along fractures.  On MANGAROON and MAROONAH, there are rare dykes that contain quartz diorite, syenite, tonalite, and biotite monzogranite. One of these dykes, located about 1.3 km west of Alma Well on MANGAROON, consists of heterogeneous quartz diorite to granodiorite with variable amounts of xenocrystic quartz and feldspar. The rocks have partly resorbed K-feldspar xenocrysts and 15% round quartz xenocrysts with biotite rich rims, and contain rounded to subangular inclusions of dolerite. The granitic rocks have a patchy granophyric texture developed. The granitic rocks in places grade into a dolerite with xenocrysts of quartz over a distance of several metres. Some of the dolerite inclusions contain acicular apatite crystals, a morphology that is commonly developed in quenched mafic magma (Vernon, 1983). Collectively, these features suggest mingling, and limited hybridization between mafic and felsic magma. The felsic magma, with its granophyric textures, may have been derived from melting of wall rock during intrusion of the dolerite.  A dyke located about 1.8 km south of the Joy Helen prospect on central MAROONAH (MGA Zone 50, 374380E 7426070N), which intruded the lower part of the Edmund Group, was dated by Wingate and Giddings (2000). The pegmatitic leucogabbro that they sampled for geochronology forms the core of the dyke, but it has thin margins of fine-grained, equigranular biotite-muscovite monzogranite. About 750 m to the north-northeast, the dyke comprises fine-grained, weakly porphyritic biotite monzogranite. The relative age of the monzogranite and dolerite could not be established, but neither rock types contains inclusions of the other.",,,,,"Dykes of the Mundine Well Dolerite intrude all the stratigraphic units in the Gascoyne Province, and rocks of the Wyloo Group, Capricorn Group, and the Bangemall Supergroup. The dykes also cut across dolerite sills of the Narimbunna Dolerite (P_-_nr-od) intruded into the Edmund Group, and dolerite sills of the Kulkatharra Dolerite (P_-WKku-od) intruded into the Edmund and Collier Groups.  The dykes are commonly associated with contact metamorphism. At several localities, thick dolerites have caused partial melting of adjacent wall rocks. East of Mullara Well on MAROONAH (MGA 357100E 7408000N), intrusion of a dolerite dyke is associated with anatexis of leucocratic granite. Anatectic melt is present in a zone up to 30 cm wide along the contact. The melted granite is grey, and consists of rounded and embayed crystals of quartz and plagioclase (pseudomorphed by very fine grained albite, sericite, and epidote) in a fine-grained groundmass of quartz, orthoclase, and plagioclase, with minor chlorite and opaques. Micrographic and granophyric textures are common. Northwest of Minga Well on MANGAROON a thick dyke is associated with remelting of medium- to coarse-grained, cream-coloured tonalite. The anatectic rocks are pale pink and fine to medium grained.  In the southwestern corner of MANGAROON, the dolerite dykes are spatially associated with fine-grained pervasive and fracture-related epidote alteration in granites of the Moorarie Supersuite. Fine-grained pervasive and fracture-related epidote alteration, possibly related to the dolerite dykes, has also been identified at several localities on MAROONAH. In the northwestern part of the sheet area, about 1.9 km south-southwest of the Monte Carlo workings, epidote alteration is developed in leucocratic monzogranite of the Durlacher Supersuite.

The Muntharra Formation consists mainly of dolostone and stromatolitic dolostone, together with sandstone, dolomitic sandstone, and siltstone. Deposition occurred under quiet-water conditions below storm wave-base, although there were localized periods of high-energy carbonate and siliciclastic sedimentation.

The lithology of this unit has also been described by Martin and Thorne (2002) and Martin et al. (2005).  Dolostones form thin- to very thick-bedded tabular units and are generally composed of either massive to laminated dololutite or weakly laminated dolarenite. The latter contains disseminated pebble- to cobble-sized chert clasts and also large (up to 2 cm) pseudomorphs of goethite after pyrite. Stromatolitic dolostones, dominated by very thick bedded  Conophyton  biostromes are present around Wandarry Creek (Zone 50, MGA 505800E 7375600N) on KENNETH RANGE. Here, the  Conophyton  forms range from 0.2 - 0.5 m across at the base and are up to 0.4 m high. Intercolumn areas are generally filled by recrystallized dololutite.  Dololutite in the Muntharra Formation is generally recrystallized and the irregular lamination is defined by layers of cryptocrystalline dark, iron- and organic-rich dolostone, alternating with light-coloured, sparry dolostone layers and areas that locally show a colloform texture. Lamination is also locally defined by recrystallized microcrystalline ferroan dolomite. Fenestral cavities are defined by concentrations of light-coloured sparry dolostone. Late-stage iron oxide crystals are disseminated throughout the rock or concentrated along laminae and post-date any dolomite veining. Peloidal grainstone is composed of clast-supported, recrystallized, equant to elliptical rounded peloids (0.2-0.5 mm) that may be partially replaced by chert. These clasts are set in a matrix of anhedral dolomite microspar. There is extensive yellow iron-oxide replacement of some clasts. This material also appears as a dissolution residue along stylolite surfaces.  Dolomitic sandstones are medium grained, planar- aminated, and contain scattered coarse quartz grains in a dolomitic matrix. Black chert nodules, which are around 15 cm long and 3 cm wide, are locally present. In addition, dolomitic sandstones are locally conglomeratic and contain angular clasts of dolarenite and large pyrite crystals up to 10 mm across along stylolite horizons. Medium grained, planar- aminated, dolomitic sandstone is interbedded with siltstone, dolomitic siltstone, and layers of black chert and chert nodules. The beds are planar, around 5-6 cm thick, and there is evidence of solution collapse structures along the chert horizons. Dolomitic sandstone beds are locally up to 10 m thick. Quartz sandstones are fine- to coarse-grained, planar laminated, contain clay pellet casts, and appear to be stylolitic in places. They are generally interbedded with dolarenite or laminated siltstone and locally contain angular chert, quartz, and siltstone clasts. Petrographically, medium- to coarse-grained lithic quartz sandstone consists of angular to well-rounded, monocrystalline or polycrystalline quartz, and chert or silicified siltstone. Syntaxial quartz cement predates compaction, and grain boundaries are defined by concentrations of clay minerals. All siliciclastic lithologies are silicified to varying degrees and siltstone and sandstone both contain goethite and hematite pseudomorphs after pyrite. ","Martin et al. (2005) argue that the lithofacies and sedimentary structures of the Muntharra Formation suggest background deposition predominantly below storm wave-base with localized high-energy deposition of carbonate grainstone, dolomitic sandstone, and sandstone. This, coupled with the localized occurrence of  Conophyton  stromatolites, suggests deposition took place either just within or below the photic zone. The presence of sulfide pseudomorphs also suggests deposition and diagenesis took place in a largely anoxic environment.",,50,,"The Muntharra Formation (P_-MEm-kd) has a sharp, conformable lower contact with member P_-MEk-sf of the Kiangi Creek Formation.

The maximum age of the Muntharra Formation is loosely constrained by its stratigraphic position, in which it appears at a higher stratigraphic position within the Edmund Group than the Kiangi Creek Formation. The Kiangi Creek Formation disconformably overlies mineralization in the Gooragoora and Irregully Formations at the Abra polymetallic deposit on CALYIE. Here, mineralization is dated to between c. 1610 and 1590 Ma (Zi et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2015).   The minimum age of c. 1465 Ma for the Muntharra Formation is derived from the maximum age of the Narimbunna Dolerite, sills of which intrude overlying units of the Edmund Group (Wingate, 2002; Martin et al., 2005). Sills belonging to the Waldburg Dolerite are intruded into the underlying Kiangi Creek Formation and lower parts of the Edmund Group on MOUNT AUGUSTUS, MANGAROON, and CANDOLLE. These sills have igneous crystallization ages of 1517-1505 Ma (GSWA 206916, Wingate, 2015; GSWA 143445, Wingate et al., 2012) and provide a younger age limit for the lower Edmund Group.

It is a sequence of poddy, minnesotaite-rich banded iron-formation (BIF), chert, shale, and carbonate that has an average thickness of about 130 m and a maximum thickness in excess of 230 m. The Nammuldi Member conformably overlies the Roy Hill Shale Member at the top of the Fortescue Group, and is conformably overlain by the MacLeod Member. The Nammuldi Member is interpreted to have been deposited in a proximal ramp setting that passes into a deep-marine environment to the southwest. Deposition took place between c. 2629 and 2627 Ma.","The Nammuldi Member is present throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region, where it is exposed on the 1:250 000 maps sheets YARRALOOLA, PYRAMID, WYLOO, MOUNT BRUCE, ROY HILL, BALFOUR DOWNS, TUREE CREEK, NEWMAN, and ROBERTSON and makes up the bulk of the exposed portion of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation. The member is typically about 130 m thick, but thickness is variable, with 40 m recorded in drill hole WRL1 near Wittenoom and 60 m near Newman (Blockley et al., 1993). Thickness variations of this unit in the Chichester Range and parts of the Fortescue Valley are complicated by a change to carbonate facies BIF, which makes identification of the constituent members of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation contentious in these areas (Lascelles 2000; Hurst et al., 2013).","The Nammuldi Member is named after Nammuldi Ridge (Zone 50, MGA 541304E 7521754N), a low topographic rise north of Mount Brockman (Blockley et al., 1993). The type section is situated along the east side of the gorge where the Hardey River cuts the Marra Mamba Iron Formation on the south limb of the Turner Syncline (Zone 50, MGA 553125E 7484468N). At this locality the member is 125.5 m thick (Blockley et al., 1993). However, recent mapping suggests that in this location, the basal contact is cut by the Moona Fault. No type area was specified by Blockley et al. (1993), but three drillholes in which mostly partial sections are recorded were nominated, viz. DDH 275, DDH 186, and WRL 1. The WRL 1 core is stored at the GSWA Core Library at Carlisle.  In addition to the formal lithostratigraphy, an informal numbering of the stilpnomelane-rich shale macrobands, combined with two marker beds, is used by the mining companies for mapping and regional correlation. The shale bands are very distinctive in natural gamma-ray logs and are numbered US1 to US18. The two marker beds are known as the  rods  and the  potato bed  (Kepert, 2018). Named crocidolite-bearing horizons (Trendall and Blockley, 1970) are recognized between US10 and US11 (Mackay Crocidolite Horizon), immediately beneath the  potato bed  (Dun Crocidolite Horizon) and at the contact with the MacLeod Member (Foxall Crocidolite Horizon).",,"The Nammuldi Member consists of distinctive yellow-weathering ferruginous chert, chert, and cherty BIF that has a characteristic pinch-and-swell or undulating bedding morphology. The weathering colour is due to the presence of trace amounts of carbonate. These BIFs and cherts are interbedded with thin stilpnomelane-rich shales and dolomitic shales. Below the  rods , the Nammuldi Member is characteristically carbonate rich, whereas it is more siliceous and cherty above this horizon. There is also a significant facies change in the Chichester Range, where all units within the Marra Mamba Iron Formation are significantly more carbonate-rich, with BIF mostly replaced by iron-rich carbonates (Hurst et al., 2013).  The  rods  is a distinctive marker horizon about 10 m thick, consisting of chert pods measuring a few centimetres in diameter that are consistently elongated in a northeasterly direction (045&deg;-060&deg;) and form a characteristic rod-like outcrop pattern on bedding surfaces. This horizon is located about 15 m above the base of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation, between US3 and US5, and US4 is located within the  rods . Locally, the  rods  take on the form of shear-band boudins, developed on either southeast- or northwest-dipping normal shear zones. Rare thin dolerite sills may be intruded as high up the succession as the  rods , particularly in the Weeli-Wolli Anticline and western limb of the Turee Creek Syncline. The  potato bed  is a distinctive unit of oblate spheroidal limonitic chert pods of variable diameter in a matrix of shaly riebeckite-rich iron formation between US12 and US16. The chert pods tend to weather preferentially, giving bedding plane exposures a pitted, egg-carton appearance. A distinctive 2 m-thick yellow-brown weathering carbonate turbidite bed is poorly preserved below the  potato bed , especially at South Flank on the southern limb of the Weeli-Wolli Anticline.","Lateral facies changes within the Nammuldi Member from carbonate- to silicate-rich between the Chichester and Hamersley Ranges, combined with the presence of carbonate turbidites in the Hamersley Ranges is indicative of deposition in a proximal ramp setting (Hurst et al., 2013), passing into a deep-marine environment towards the southwest (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003; Pickard et al., 2004).",,230,,"The Nammuldi Member conformably overlies the Roy Hill Shale Member of the underlying Jeerinah Formation, and in turn is conformably overlain by the MacLeod Member of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation.

The member conformably overlies the Ullawarra Formation parent (P_-MEl-sl) and its upper contact, although not exposed, is probably faulted. The member consists of quartz sandstone, siltstone, and minor conglomerate and was probably laid down in a nearshore, shallow-marine shelf environment. The Nanular Member has not been dated directly, but was probably deposited around 1590-1455 Ma. "," The Nanular Member is only exposed along the southern part of the Edmund Basin on eastern ERRABIDDY, MARQUIS, and MILGUN. Here it outcrops immediately north of the Mount Clere Fault and has an estimated maximum thickness of about 1600 m. "," The name Nanular Member was first used by Sheppard and Swager (1999) and subsequently by Sheppard and Occhipinti (2000) to refer to the fine-grained arenaceous unit that lies stratigraphically above the Devil Creek and Discovery Formations on MARQUIS and ERRABIDDY. Elias et al. (1980) had previously mapped these rocks as an undivided arenite of the Bangemall Group. The same unit was called the Nanular Sandstone by Muhling and Brakel (1985) who selected the outcrop south of the Sawback Range on MARQUIS (Zone 50, MGA 580500E 7218300N) as the type area. The member is named after Nanular Creek (Zone 50, MGA 558850E 7224000N), just west of Mount Clere Homestead on MARQUIS. ",," The Nanular Member (P_-MEln-ss) consists of quartz sandstone, siltstone, and minor conglomerate. Sandstones form low, rounded to steep-sided hills, whereas siltstones form poorly exposed, flat-lying outcrops. Cubic crystal molds after former pyrite are abundant locally (Muhling and Brakel, 1985).  Quartz sandstones are thinly to thickly bedded and are mostly fine- to medium-grained, although coarse-grained sandstones are present on MILGUN (Zone 50, MGA 617400E 7209000N). Fine- to medium-grained sandstones are generally tabular to broadly lenticular bedded. Although some beds are massive, most show either parallel-planar or undulatory lamination, together with locally preserved ripple cross-lamination. Lenticular mudstone-pebble layers are sometimes present in the lower parts of some beds, whereas climbing ripple cross-lamination may occur in upper parts. Bedding surfaces are often marked by primary current lineation, current ripples, or combined-flow interference ripples. These structures indicate a consistent paleocurrent flow towards the west. Coarse-grained sandstones are generally thickly to very thickly bedded and are generally massive, although parallel stratification is present in the lower and upper parts of some beds. Mudstone-pebble intraclast layers are present locally and bedding surfaces may preserve primary current lineation with an east-southeasterly to west-northwesterly trend.  Siltstone units are generally tabular bedded. Their internal structure is usually parallel-planar laminated or ripple cross-laminated.  Petrographically, the quartz sandstone contains subrounded to rounded quartz grains, with minor opaque minerals and &le;3% feldspar grains (Sheppard and Occhipinti, 2000). Some quartz grains show evidence of transport and sedimentation prior to redeposition in the Nanular Member. A few quartz grains showing straight to slightly curved, subparallel lamellae spaced across the grain are present indicating some of the sedimentary material was derived from a meteorite impact site (Sheppard and Occhipinti, 2000). "," The fine- to medium-grained nature of the rock types, together with their compositional and textural maturity, and variety of sedimentary structures suggests that member P_-MEln-ss was laid down in a nearshore, shallow marine shelf environment. Lenticular layers of mudstone rip-up clasts were probably formed during major storm events whereas siltstone beds were probably deposited by weak currents and suspension settling during calm conditions.

It comprises metamorphosed mesocratic and leucocratic tonalite, both of which are dated at c. 1975 Ma. The Nardoo Granite intrudes foliated and gneissic granites of the Dalgaringa Supersuite with igneous crystallization ages of 2005-1985 Ma.","The Nardoo Granite forms an elliptical, east-northeasterly trending intrusion at least 45 km long and up to 20 km wide, the bulk of which is exposed on GLENBURGH. The Nardoo Granite is also exposed in the southwestern corner of LANDOR to the east. Isolated outcrops of fresh granodiorite west of Dispute Bore in the eastern part of LANDOR are also interpreted as part of the Nardoo Granite. If this interpretation is correct, then the Nardoo Granite may be more than 75 km long and underlie an area of more than 1000 km 2 .  The Nardoo Granite forms a gently undulating land surface with boulders, tors, and whalebacks, amongst locally derived sandy colluvial and sheetwash deposits. In the southeastern corner of GLENBURGH, fresh granite is exposed beneath an old dissected land surface marked by ferruginous duricrust, saprolite, and weathered rock.",The Nardoo Granite is named after Nardoo Well near the eastern edge of GLENBURGH. The Nardoo Granite is equivalent to the gneissic biotite-hornblende granodiorite of the Dalgety Gneiss Dome of Williams (1986).,,"The Nardoo Granite consists of two intrusive phases: medium-grained, equigranular or porphyritic, mesocratic biotite metatonalite and subordinate metamorphosed quartz-diorite (P_-DAna-mgt), and medium-grained, weakly porphyritic, leucocratic biotite metatonalite and minor metagranodiorite (P_-DAna-mgtl).  The two main intrusive phases of the Nardoo Granite correspond in part to the two-fold subdivision of the early stage gneissic granitoids southeast of Dalgety Downs Homestead outlined by Williams et al. (1983). Medium-grained mesocratic biotite metatonalite and subordinate metamorphosed quartz diorite (P_-DAna-mgt) is the slightly more abundant of the two phases and predominates in the northern half of the intrusion. Medium-grained, weakly porphyritic, leucocratic biotite metatonalite (P_-DAna-mgtl) is the main rock type in the southern part of the intrusion.  The mesocratic metatonalite and metamorphosed quartz diorite (P_-DAna-mgt) contains less than 5% tabular plagioclase phenocrysts, up to 1 cm long, in a medium-grained groundmass. In places, rust-brown prismatic crystals of altered allanite are visible in hand specimen. Numerous clots, 0.5 - 1.0 cm in diameter, of fine-grained biotite and chlorite are scattered throughout the rock. On weathered surfaces the metatonalite is commonly dark grey and contains small pits after mafic clots. Most samples of the mesocratic metatonalite and metamorphosed quartz diorite are variably foliated and recrystallized. The rocks consist of plagioclase (andesine-oligoclase) and subordinate quartz and biotite, with accessory apatite, zircon, and allanite. Some samples contain a few percent microcline. Biotite is chocolate brown and constitutes about 20% of most rocks. Many biotite crystals have crystallographically oriented inclusions of acicular ?rutile. A few samples contain prominent, euhedral, zoned crystals of zircon, up to 400 &mu;m long. Elliptical and lenticular inclusions of fine-grained metatonalite up to 1 m long are common in the medium-grained metatonalite. Angular slab-like inclusions of fine-grained metatonalite up to several metres long are locally present in the southeastern corner of the sheet area.",,,,,"The Nardoo Granite intrudes foliated and gneissic granite dated at 2005-1985 Ma, and interlayered amphibolite and calc-silicate gneiss, and contains several large rafts of foliated and gneissic granite up to 7 km long and 1 km wide. Inclusions of fine-grained, pegmatitebanded tonalite, fine-grained granite, and amphibolite are widespread in the Nardoo Granite. These inclusions, and the gneissic fabric within them, are commonly folded about an axial surface parallel to a penetrative foliation. These relationships indicate that the Nardoo Granite was intruded after deformation and high-grade metamorphism that occurred between c. 1985 and c. 1975 Ma. Therefore, the granite cannot have formed as a para-autochthonous diapir following partial melting of the enclosing foliated and gneissic granites as suggested by Williams (1986).  The Nardoo Granite is intruded by numerous dykes of coarse-grained leucocratic biotite granite (P_-MO-gmlp) southeast of Brockman Well on the western part of LANDOR, and by veins and dykes of coarse-grained granite and pegmatite (P_-MO-gp) on the southern part of GLENBURGH, between Dardoo Well and Salt Well, and east-northeast of Parrot Bore. The Nardoo Granite is also intruded by numerous dolerite dykes; some of these probably belong to the c. 755 Ma Mundine Well Dolerite (P_-_mw-od), but others may belong to Mesoproterozoic (?1210 Ma) dyke suites.",,17,,,,4,,,,1977,4,1974,4,"A weakly foliated, metamorphosed, porphyritic, mesocratic tonalite to granodiorite about 4 km north of Dardoo Well was sampled for SHRIMP U-Pb zircon geochronology (GSWA 142932).

1298,73261,P_-_nr-od,1,Narimbunna Dolerite,1,Dolerite and gabbro sills intruded into Edmund Group,"The Narimbunna Dolerite (P_-_nr-od) comprises voluminous, predominantly northwest-trending dolerite sills with strike lengths up to 125 km. The sills were emplaced into sedimentary rocks of the Edmund Group in the Capricorn Orogen, and are most prominent and thickest (up to 1000 m) in the western part of the Edmund Basin on the EDMUND 1:250 000 map sheet. In the eastern part of the basin, the sills have an average thickness of 100-500 m. The sills have either sharp contacts with the host sedimentary rocks defined by  chilled  and  baked margins , or are characterized by contact metamorphic aureoles metres to decimetres thick that are typically defined by silicification and the formation of hornfels.   The Narimbunna Dolerite consists of moderately to distinctly altered, massive, medium- to coarse-grained, equigranular dolerite with local, irregular patches of pegmatitic leucogabbro. Plagioclase and pyroxene are the primary minerals, which are extensively altered to low- to medium-grade metamorphic minerals including amphibole, chlorite, hornblende, tremolite, sericite, albite, saussurite, leucoxene, maghemite, and lesser amount of actinolite, biotite, and minor calcite. Emplacement of the dolerite is dated to between c. 1465 and 1449 Ma.   The Narimbunna Dolerite is moderately enriched in most rare earth elements (REE) and high field strength elements (HFSE) , and has moderately negatively sloping chondrite-normalized light REE profiles with low to moderate degrees of fractionation. The mafic rocks have relatively high  143 Nd/ 144 Nd values ranging from 0.511752 to 0.512045, with uniformly negative &epsilon;Nd (T)  values from -2.35 to -5.36, leading to a narrow range of depleted model ages (T2DM) between 2.15 and 2.38 Ga.","The Narimbunna Dolerite is mainly exposed as pebbly to bouldery colluvium or as blocky rounded outcrops that locally form pinnacles or columns (e.g. HNCMUL001371, Zone 50, MGA 628633E 7247261N) on low ridges and flat hills. The dolerite also outcrops in stream beds and on river banks, or at the foot of low slopes. Mafic rocks are commonly distinctly weathered and, in places, are spheroidally weathered, and commonly fractured or cleaved. Locally, ferruginous duricrust derived from sedimentary rocks is present close to or in contact with dolerite; at some localities the latter is overlain by saprock (e.g. WAROX site AMT1017, Zone 50, MGA 499549E 7298339N).  The Narimbunna Dolerite is present throughout the western part of the Capricorn Orogen, where it intrudes sedimentary rocks of the Edmund Group (Depositional packages 1 to 4). The dolerite sills are particularly extensive on the EDMUND and MOUNT EGERTON 1:250 000 map sheets, and also occur on the northern parts of the MOUNT PHILLIPS and ROBINSON RANGE 1:250 000 map sheets. Minor occurrences have also been mapped on northwestern and southwestern CALYIE, and around the northwestern closure of the Mangaroon Syncline on LYNDON.   Throughout the Western Capricorn Orogen, the dolerites generally form laterally continuous (up to 125 km in length) sills that range in thickness from a few metres up to 100 m for single intrusions, with an estimated total composite thickness of up to 1000 m. Although most sills are locally conformable with the host sedimentary rocks, they are regionally discordant along strike and are characterized by a step-and-stair geometry (Martin et al., 2005). Due to the orientation of regional-scale fold hinges throughout the Edmund Fold Belt, the sills mostly trend northwesterly, although within the Resolution West and Resolution East Synclines on CANDOLLE and MOUNT EGERTON they trend northeasterly (e.g. HNCCAN000413, Zone 50, MGA 539046E 7255932N, and WAROX site WAD2572, Zone 50, MGA 559431E 77261391N).  Throughout the Wanna and Mangaroon Synclines, the sills attain a maximum total thickness (composite thickness) of about 1000 m. Here, large volumes of Narimbunna Dolerite intrude a mixed succession of siliciclastic and dolomitic rocks of the Edmund Group, inflating the stratigraphy by up to 200%. Farther south, within the Cobra Synclinorium, on MOUNT AUGUSTUS, and within the Resolution West Syncline, on CANDOLLE, the sills are 600700 m thick, progressively reducing in thickness (100-500 m) and volume towards the eastern part of the basin. They have a maximum estimated total thickness of about 500 m within the Hells Doorway Syncline on MOUNT EGERTON, about 350 m within the Range Creek Syncline on MULGUL, and up to 150 m within the Mingah Springs Anticline on CALYIE.","The Narimbunna Dolerite is named after Narimbunna Pool (Zone 50, MGA 405268E 7402110N), situated approximately 4.3 km west of Ullawarra Homestead on ULLAWARRA. The name was first published by Thorne and Martin (2007) on the PEEDAWARRA map sheet.",,"The Narimbunna Dolerite typically consists of greenish, medium- to very coarse-grained, mesocratic and equigranular dolerite or gabbro with rare igneous layering (e.g. HNCMUL001199, Zone 50, MGA 619968E 7289422N). It is moderately to distinctly altered, massive or locally foliated (e.g. WAROX site AMT338, Zone 50, MGA 406400E 7399000N). Locally the dolerite contains irregular enclaves of very coarse-grained pegmatitic leucogabbro, up to 70 cm across, or rare leucocratic veins (e.g. OXBPEA000464, Zone 50, MGA 462209E 7366323N) interpreted as a late-stage hydrous fractionate of the primary mafic magma. Commonly, these late-stage leucogabbros contain magmatic zircon and baddeleyite. The central portions of the sills are generally medium- to very coarse-grained, although close to the upper contact, the sill margins are typically fine grained and locally chilled, and in places composed of aphyric dolerite that may contain amygdales, vesicles or spherical to ovoid varioles up to 1.5 cm in diameter (e.g. WAROX site AMT350, Zone 50, MGA 402000E 7397800N). Varioles are typically filled with bladed pale-green amphibole and chlorite, and the rim of some varioles is marked by a higher concentration of granular opaque oxide. Interstices contain minor late-stage alkali feldspar, quartz, and chlorite, with development of acicular apatite (Morris and Pirajno, 2005), whereas chilled margins of the amygdaloidal dolerite consist of amygdales filled with aggregates of zoned K-feldspar and coarsely crystalline quartz, chlorite, epidote, and carbonate (Martin et al, 2005).   The Narimbunna Dolerite is composed principally of plagioclase (50-65%; An 28-64 ) and pyroxene (30-45%), the latter consisting mainly of clinopyroxene (augite, and less commonly, pigeonite) and orthopyroxene-hypersthene (at some localities up to 5-10%). Also present are minor amounts of opaque oxide (up to 7-8%; ilmenite-magnetite-leucoxene-maghemite), fine-grained interstitial quartz-feldspar granophyric intergrowths (up to 10%), and rare dark olive-green hornblende (~1%). Accessory minerals are quartz, alkali feldspar, apatite, zircon, baddeleyite, and very fine-grained radioactive inclusions in amphibole.   The dolerite typically displays equigranular and subophitic to less common ophitic textures, where both plagioclase and pyroxene typically form extensively altered, prismatic crystals. The pyroxene forms granular, anhedral to subhedral prisms, from 0.2 to 7 mm in size, and are typically unzoned. Pyroxene encloses subhedral to euhedral prisms of plagioclase (up to 2-8 mm long). Locally the plagioclase laths are also partly enclosed by euhedral opaque iron-titanium oxide minerals. Some plagioclase grains are zoned, with calcic-rich cores. Plagioclase is locally replaced by green, recrystallized fibrous amphibole, chlorite, albite, saussurite, sericite and epidote, particularly along cleavage and twin planes.  Pyroxene is replaced by blue-green hornblende, fibrous uralitic tremolite and chlorite, minor biotite and sericite. A well-developed alteration zonation is developed locally on the margins and along the cleavage planes of clinopyroxene crystals. Subhedral to dendritic-skeletal opaque oxides are up to 6 mm long, and contain ilmenite lamellae surrounded by polycrystalline leucoxene or maghemite. Small opaque anhedral crystals and aggregates of probably secondary ?magnetite are also present. Alkali feldspar forms equant anhedral grains, interstitial to plagioclase and altered pyroxene. Apatite needles are present in plagioclase and quartz. Zircon and baddeleyite are present within chlorite and plagioclase. Very fine-grained radioactive inclusions of unknown composition are present within hornblende and recrystallized fibrous amphibole (Wingate, 2002).  Fine-grained portions of the leucopegmatitic gabbro pods and lenses typically contain prismatic crystals of anhedral to subhedral plagioclase up to 3 cm in length, and granular to prismatic crystals (up to 10 mm in length) of subhedral to euhedral pyroxene. The finer grained phases typically comprise euhedral opaque oxides, interstitial quartz-feldspar (?albite) granophyric intergrowths (~10-15%), acicular apatite, and fine-grained minerals surrounded by pleochroic haloes. Accessory phases include zircon and baddeleyite. The primary mineral phases are extensively altered with sericite, albite, chlorite and saussurite aggregates developing over plagioclase, and brownish-green fibrous amphibole, greenish chlorite and leucoxene over pyroxene.   On MARQUIS, the dolerite sills (e.g. HNCMAR000920, Zone 50, MGA 575009E, 7227052N) contain extensive talc and iron-titanium oxide pseudomorphs after olivine, which are surrounded by hypersthene. Plagioclase is variably altered to saussurite, and pyroxene is locally altered to actinolite.  The Narimbunna Dolerite typically has a relatively wide range of major and trace-element compositions, with generally low-to-moderate concentrations of SiO 2  (47.9251.04%, average = 49.58%), K 2 O (0.431.75%, average = 0.87%), P 2 O 5  (0.110.34%, average = 0.20%) and Na 2 O (1.482.79%, average =2.14%), moderate concentrations of MgO (4.468.51%, average = 6.19%), moderate-to-high concentrations of CaO (4.5911.62%, average = 9.86%), and variable Mg# values (35.6860.23, average = 47.97). Chromium concentrations are extremely variable, but on average relatively high Cr (49292 ppm, average = 158 ppm ), and Cu content is typically low Cu (46140 ppm, average = 99 ppm).  The mafic rocks are moderately enriched in most REE and HFSE, including: La (10.57 24.15 ppm, average = 15.76 ppm), Ce (17.7060.05 ppm, average = 32.40), Nd (9.6230.75 ppm, average = 17.80 ppm), Sm (2.676.71 ppm, average = 4.26 ppm), Gd (2.876.87 ppm, average = 4.47 ppm), Yb (1.533.68 ppm, average = 2.41 ppm), Y (15.9041.40 ppm, average = 26.71 ppm), Zr (64214 ppm, average = 115 ppm), Nb (5.7617.30 ppm, average = 9.91 ppm ), Hf (1.685.20 ppm, average = 2.95 ppm), Th (0.943.90 ppm, average = 1.87 ppm ). They have moderately negatively sloping chondrite-normalized light REE profiles with low-to-moderate degrees of fractionation: (La/Sm) N  = (1.833.09), weak positive Eu anomalies and marked negative Sm anomalies, while the heavy REE are very weakly fractionated with an almost flat pattern (Gd/Yb) N  = (1.391.83). The rocks generally have low trace-element ratios: Th/La (0.090.15, average = 0.12), La/Nb (1.282.05, average = 1.61), Th/Nb (0.140.25, average = 0.19), and relatively elevated La/Sm (2.424.78, average = 3.71).  The Narimbunna Dolerite has relatively high  143 Nd/ 144 Nd values ranging from 0.511752 to 0.512045, with uniformly negative &epsilon;Nd (T)  values from -2.35 to -5.36, leading to a narrow range of depleted model ages (T2DM) between 2.15 and 2.38 Ga.",,,1000,,"Throughout the Western Capricorn Orogen, the Narimbunna Dolerite forms laterally continuous (up to 125 km in length) sills that were emplaced into sedimentary rocks at all stratigraphic levels within the Edmund Group below the Coodardoo Formation (the uppermost unit of Depositional package 4). While most sills are locally conformable with the host sedimentary rocks, they are regionally discordant along strike and characterized by a step-and-stair geometry (Martin et al., 2005; e.g. HNCCAL000185, Zone 50, MGA 655564E 7283408N). Throughout the basin, the contact of sills with sedimentary rocks is either sharp, with poorly exposed  chilled  margins of fine-grained dolerite or  baked  sedimentary rocks (e.g. AMTBAN001349, Zone 50, MGA 503289E 7331135N and WAROX site AMT350, Zone 50, MGA 402000E 7397800N) or characterized by contact metamorphic aureoles decimetres to metres thick (depending on sill thickness and host-rock composition). The metamorphic aureoles are mainly defined by silicification and recrystallization to form hornfels (e.g. WAROX sites PCM818, Zone 50, MGA 551560E 7314300N and AMTBAN002571, MGA 562263E 7269134N), or locally form dark-grey to black ferruginous and silicified rocks. In some cases, the contact zones are marked by folding or brecciation of the host rocks (e.g. WAROX site AMT13, Zone 50, MGA 418750E, 7427720N). Quartz veins and locally brecciated Fe-oxides are also associated with the contact zones, and are found within both the sedimentary rocks and the dolerite (e.g. AMTBAN002571, Zone 50, MGA 562263E 7269134N and WAROX site AMT459, Zone 50, MGA 413100E 7349171N). Rare variscite veinlets are also found within bleached sedimentary rocks close to the contact zones (e.g. MXEMAR000360, Zone 50, MGA 588189E 7222058N).   In the Wanna and Mangaroon Synclines on MAROONAH, MANGAROON, ULLAWARRA, EDMUND and ELLIOTT CREEK, where the sills are thickest, the dolerites intrude a mixed succession of siliciclastic and dolomitic rocks at all stratigraphic levels of the Edmund Group. Farther south, on ULLAWARRA, ELLIOTT CREEK, PEEDAWARRA, and MOUNT AUGUSTUS, the sills intrude mainly the upper stratigraphic levels (Depositional packages 3 and 4). Towards the central, southern and eastern parts of the basin, the sills thin (to 100-500 m) and become less voluminous; here they mailnly intrude the upper stratigraphic levels of the basin. However, locally the sills intrude the lowermost succession of the Edmund Group (Depositional package 1), for example just to the north of the Ti Tree Syncline on MOUNT PHILLIPS and EUDAMULLAH, to the north of the Gaffney Fault on CANDOLLE, and south of Tonys Fault on TEANO.  On LANDOR, MOUNT PHILLIPS, ERRABIDDY, and PINK HILLS, the Narimbunna Dolerite is locally in fault contact with Paleoproterozoic granites of the Moorarie Supersuite. On MANGAROON and MOUNT PHILLIPS the dolerite is also in fault contact with pelitic gneiss, psammitic schist, metasandstones and quartz-muscovite schist of the Pooranoo Metamorphics.",,17,,,,4,,,,1465,3,1449,5,"Five Narimbunna Dolerite sills have been dated directly by SHRIMP, using magmatic zircons and baddeleyite grains extracted from medium- to coarse-grained dolerite or pegmatitic leucogabbro patches of the sills.   On ELLIOTT CREEK, zircon from a pegmatitic leucogabbro patch enriched in quartz-alkali feldspar intergrowths, about 1 km south of Coodardo Gap, gave a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* age of 1449 Â± 3 Ma (Wingate, 2002; sample WANH). A similar weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* age of 1450 Â± 5 Ma (GSWA 189223, Wingate et al., 2013) was obtained from zircon extracted from a medium-grained dolerite on MILGUN, about 3.5 km south-southeast of Mount Arapiles. On CANDOLLE, 300 m northest of Top Camp Well, zircon from a medium- to coarse-grained granophyric dolerite provided a U-Pb concordia age of 1452 Â± 5 Ma (GSWA 143450, Wingate et al., 2012a). Baddeleyite from the same sample yielded a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* age of 1449 Â± 10 Ma (GSWA 143450, Wingate et al., 2012b). Zircon and baddeleyite from a coarse-grained dolerite on MANGAROON, 2.5 km southeast of Maroonah Well, gave weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* ages of 1462 Â± 3 Ma and 1465 Â± 35 Ma, respectively (GSWA 156751, Nelson, 2001). The weighted mean age for all accepted  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* data (both zircon and baddeleyite; n = 26 of 27) is 1465 Â± 3 Ma (Wingate, 2002) which is taken to be the best estimate for the crystallization age of the dolerite sill. A fine- to medium-grained dolerite on the southwestern slope of Sawback range on MARQUIS, yielded only two baddeleyite grains. Three analyses of these grains which yielded  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* dates of 1520 Â± 32 Ma to 1382 Â± 52 Ma (GSWA 189224, Wingate et al., 2014), that are dispersed beyond analytical precision (MSWD = 4.2). However, the dates of 1520-1382 Ma indicate a mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of c. 1450 Ma.  These ages are considered to date the timing of emplacement and igneous crystallization of the Narimbunna Dolerite sills. The oldest and youngest crystallization ages are outside the uncertainty intervals of each other, implying that emplacement of the dolerite sills took place over a c. 16 Ma period between c. 1465 and 1449 Ma.",No,,,267,,No,Published,Yes,Yes,P_,_nr,,13,3,,MIGSDRH,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,No,No
567,74876,A-ANna-xony-any,566,Narndee Igneous Complex,1,"Layered gabbro, with dunite, pyroxenite, anorthosite, and hornblende gabbro; local well-developed cyclical layering on a hundred metre scale; metamorphosed","The Narndee Igneous Complex belongs to the Boodanoo Suite (A-ANB-xony-any), which is characterized by the presence of primary hornblende. It lies southwest of the Windimurra Igneous Complex (A-ANwi-xony-am) in the central Youanmi Terrane, western Yilgarn Craton. Its areal extent is about 550 km&sup2; and it is moderately well exposed for approximately 30 km in north-south and 25 km in east-west direction. This complex is distinguished from nearby mafic-ultramafic layered igneous complexes by the presence of significant amounts of primary igneous hornblende oikocrysts (up to 15 %).   The complex is divided into three zones, each approximately two kilometres thick: an ultramafic zone is primarily composed of pyroxene peridotite and olivine pyroxenite; a lower zone consisting of cyclically layered peridotite-pyroxenite-gabbronorite-anorthosite, and a middle zone primarily composed of cyclically layered pyroxenite and gabbronorite. All the zones contain oikocrysts of hornblende, typically mantling pyroxene and enclosing olivineÂ±plagioclase. The lower and middle zones are concentrically layered and inward dipping at an average of 30&deg;, forming a north-plunging syncline that is about 30 km across. The ultramafic zone is separated from the rest of the complex by faults and its layering is interrupted by voluminous intrusion of middle zone leucogabbros. Geophysical modelling suggests that the ultramafic zone, in addition to its outcrop in the northwest of the complex, probably directly underlies the lower zone. A leucocratic upper zone has not been identified and may be detached or eroded away.  Hornblende gabbro from within the complex has been directly dated at c. 2799 Ma. The complex intrudes sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Norie Group and is closely related to adjacent granitic rocks of the Mount Kenneth Suite.  The ultramafic and lowermost lower zones of the complex have been explored for Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization.","The Narndee Igneous Complex is located on southern COOLAMANINU and northern BUNGAR. Parts of the complex extend north and east from the main body as metamorphosed and deformed lenses incorporated into the Challa and Cundimurra Shear Zones. Including these lenses, the complex extends for 44 km in north to south direction and 38 km in east to west direction, with an areal extent of approximately 550 km&sup2;. Gravity modelling on BUNGAR indicates that the main body of the complex is underlain by 2 km of ultramafic zone, so the total vertical thickness of the complex is probably about 6 km.  The Narndee Igneous Complex is best exposed in a region approximately 4 km north of Tandys Bore (Zone 50, MGA 610924E 6784821N) where resistant ridges of fresh cumulate rocks span portions of the lower and middle zones. Areas of detailed lithological mapping from Bunting et al. (1987) were used to define parts of units within each of the zones of that comprise the complex.","The Narndee Igneous Complex is named after the Narndee Homestead (Zone 50 MGA 615000E 6797000N) on COOLAMANINU. Previously it has been called the 'Narndee intrusion' (Scowen, 1991) and the 'Narndee complex' (Bunting, 2004).  The type area for the ultramafic zone of the complex is near Milgoo Peak (Zone 50, MGA 610201E 6807236N). Locality 5.1 of Ivanic (2016) displays several features in the type area of the ultramafic zone.  The type section for the lower and middle zones of the complex is a traverse from west to east from TJIWIN000336 (Zone 50, MGA 611363E 6789091N) to TJIWIN000326 (Zone 50, MGA 612891E 6789239N) on BUNGAR. In this section cyclical layering is evident on a hectometre scale, with each cycle involving several lithologies. The base of each cycle is typically a serpentinized peridotite, which passes up through pyroxenite to leucogabbro. Each lithology occupies approximately 30 m of vertical stratigraphic thickness. The lithologies contain up to 15% modal igneous hornblende, with additional metamorphic amphibole present in metamorphosed areas. In a few of the outcrops along the type section, modal igneous layering and/or crystal lamination indicates that large-scale layering dips approximately 40&deg; towards the centre of the complex, in this case to the east.   About halfway along the section, there is a conformable contact between the lower and middle zones of the Narndee Igneous Complex. On a small scale, this contact is not conspicuous; however, it marks the change from a pyroxenite-rich lower zone (to the west) to a more gabbronorite-rich middle zone (to the east).   Locality 5.2 of Ivanic (2016) describes a traverse through the lower and middle zones of the complex near the type section.",,"The Narndee Igneous Complex contains three major components: an ultramafic, a lower, and an upper zone. The ultramafic zone consists of approximately 40% olivine pyroxenite, 30% pyroxene peridotite, 10% pyroxenite, and 20% melanocratic gabbronorite. These rocks are interlayered, but poor exposure and strong lateritic weathering make it difficult to determine the way-up and contact relationships between layers. Disseminated chromite is present in a few exposures of peridotitic rock in this zone (e.g. TJIWIN090208, Zone 50, MGA 609217E 6804105N). The ultramafic zone forms a south-plunging synform, which is not contiguous with the main body of the complex. Large volumes of middle zone rocks within the ultramafic zone form 30-200 m-wide sheets, but there is no observed contact between rocks of the ultramafic zone and those of the lower zone.  The lower zone of the complex, which underlies the middle zone and has been mapped mainly south of the ultramafic zone, is concentrically layered and inward dipping at an average of 40&deg;. This arcuate feature forms a broadly north-plunging syncline, which is approximately 30 km wide. The lower zone consists of cyclically layered peridotite-pyroxenite-gabbronorite-anorthosite megacycles. Oxide-rich horizons associated with ultramafic lithologies of the lower zone have also been noted (e.g. at site TJIUMF160022, Zone 50, MGA 626885E 6780512N).   The middle zone of the complex conformably overlies the lower zone. It is primarily composed of cyclically layered pyroxenite and gabbronorite with minor serpentinite, in seven cycles (Scowen, 1991; e.g. TJIWIN000321, Zone 50, MGA 615968E 6788209N). Local leucogabbronorite contains up to 15% hornblende oikocrysts, typically mantling pyroxene and enclosing plagioclase. Layering in the middle zone is shallower than in the lower zone, with dips with an average of approximately 20&deg;. The middle zone is surrounded by rocks of the lower zone of the complex in the west, south, and east.   Metaperidotites throughout the stratigraphy of the complex contain mostly 3-6 mm olivine cumulate crystals with larger crystals of interstitial pyroxene, typically with a mesocumulate texture. Pyroxenites typically have a 20 mm grain size and adcumulate texture. Mafic lithologies are characterized by orthocumulate texture with 3-8 mm cumulate crystals of plagioclaseÂ±olivine and interstitial pyroxeneÂ±hornblende, mainly 5-15 mm but locally as oikocrysts up to 25 mm. All lithologies may contain minor cumulus chromiteÂ±magnetiteÂ±ilmenite and/or accessory interstitial phlogopiteÂ±apatite.  Metamorphism of the Narndee Igneous Complex is most evident in the marginal regions adjacent to metagranitic rocks of various ages, which crosscut the complex. Pseudomorphing and/or recrystallization of gabbroic rocks has produced assemblages of actinolite-epidote-chlorite (e.g. TJIWIN000705, Zone 50, MGA 617605E 6789294N).  Chemical variation recorded by Scowen (1991) from limited drillcore shows many reversals to more magnesian compositions up-sequence, which correlate well with the bases of several of the cyclic units of the lower and middle zones. In general, the most magnesian and calcic minerals are located within the ultramafic zone, with more ferroan and sodic compositions recorded higher in the stratigraphy. Olivine varies between Fo62 and Fo87 and pyroxenes have Mg# between about 60 and 90. Amphibole is typically close to a hornblende in composition and according to Scowen (1991) it varies from more calcic to more ferroan pargasite upwards in the stratigraphy. Valetich (2011) records Mg# variation in amphibole between 53 and 82 and plagioclase compositions ranging from An57 to An85.  Whole-rock AFM compositions of the Narndee Igneous Complex are in the tholeiitic field (Scowen, 1991), but are not enriched in iron. The complex has distinctly elevated light rare earth element compositions compared to the rocks of the Meeline Suite (A-ANM-xony-amy). Isotope chemistry of the complex is discussed in Ivanic et al. (2015), where the high water contents are demonstrated to be related to an elevated water content within the mantle source. ",,,,,"In the west and south, the Narndee Igneous Complex intrudes rocks of the Tuckanarra Suite (A-TU-mgmu), including the Cundimurra Monzogranite (A-TUcu-mgmu).  In the southeast of the Narndee Igneous Complex, gabbroic rocks of the lower zone are interleaved with metasedimentary rafts of the Norie Group (A-NO-xmb-f; e.g. TJIWIN090546, Zone 50, MGA 630179E 6787243N). The metasedimentary rocks are cordierite-rich and locally form granoblastic xenoliths within gabbros of the lower zone (TJIUMF160009, Zone 50, MGA 632427E 6805557N). They are therefore likely to be a result of contact metamorphism from intrusion of the Narndee Igneous Complex. Farther southeast, a large granitic intrusion assigned to the Rothsay Suite (A-ANR-mgsm) intrudes into the lower zone locally.  Abundant intrusions of metagranite of the Mount Kenneth Suite (A-ANK-mg; e.g. TJIWIN000750, Zone 50, MGA 610703E 6793971N) crosscut the complex. They form small plugs and dykes and larger apophyses which separate 100 m-scale rafts of amphibolitized gabbros and ultramafic rocks locally. Dykes of porphyritic rhyolite of the Mount Kenneth Suite (A-ANK-gnap) also crosscut both these metagranitic rocks and rocks of the complex in places. In the southwest of the lower zone are possible hybrid rocks adjacent to dated metagranitic intrusions of Mount Kenneth Suite (e.g. TJIWIN000917, Zone 50, MGA 611891E 6785453N), suggesting that it is locally coeval with the Narndee Igneous Complex. For further details, see the  Geochronology  section below.  The intrusion of the Mount Kenneth and Rothsay Suites into the complex is probably responsible for local metamorphism and deformation. However, the majority of deformation (and metamorphism) is most likely due to the intrusion of the Tuckanarra Suite to the west of the complex (e.g. at geochronology sample site MTWBUN000162, Zone 50, MGA 610848E 6785494N; GSWA 185997, Wingate et al., 2015b).",,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,2799,,2799,,"A hornblende gabbro (A-ANnm-oh) from the middle zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex has been directly dated at 2799 Â± 7 Ma (GSWA 191056, Wingate et al., 2010) using combined baddeleyite and zircon U-Pb analyses.   The complex crosscuts metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Norie Group in several places. These were probably deposited at about the same time as a basaltic andesite in the same succession from 2.3 km north of Tootawarra Well (Zone 50, MGA 605705E 6790471N) that has been dated at 2818 Â± 3 Ma (GSWA 193979, Wingate et al., 2012a).   Granitic intrusions of the Mount Kenneth Suite and associated rhyolitic dykes (A-ANK-gnap) crosscut the complex extensively. A hybrid rock type in the southwestern part of the lower zone of the complex is in contact with metagranite of the Mount Kenneth Suite (TJIWIN000917, Zone 50, MGA 611891E 6785453N). Its age is 2803 Â± 4 Ma (GSWA 185996, Wingate et al., 2015a) and it may be an example of coeval mafic and felsic magma. Other crosscutting plutons and veins of the Mount Kenneth Suite have been dated at 2811 Â± 7 Ma (GSWA 193967, Wingate et al., 2012b) and 2806 Â± 3 Ma (GSWA 185995, Wingate et al., 2014). More conservatively, this c. 2818 Ma age could be used the maximum age of the complex.  Intrusion of the Mount Kenneth and Rothsay Suites into the complex is probably responsible for local metamorphism. However, the majority of metamorphism is thought to have been associated with deformation during intrusion of the Tuckanarra Suite at c. 2679 Ma (e.g. GSWA 185997, Wingate et al., 2015b).

It is in faulted contact with the ultramafic zone (A-ANnu-xap-ao) and lies conformably beneath the middle zone (A-ANnm-xom-mat). It is up to 2 km thick and consists of several megacyclic units, each approximately 100 m in thickness. These megacycles have fractionated upwards from peridotite at their base through to pyroxenite and gabbronorite. Anorthosite has been observed at the top of cycles in places. Each of the lithological components is typically 20-30 m thick with metre- to decametre-scale internal layering (e.g. see A-ANnl-omh). Although not directly dated, the lower zone probably crystallized at about the same time as the age inferred for the complex as a whole, i.e. 2799 Â± 7 Ma.","The lower zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex has an arcuate expression, approximately 30 km in diameter on northern BUNGAR and southern COOLAMANINU and surrounds the middle zone.

In the northwest, the lower zone it is juxtaposed against the ultramafic zone along a northerly trending fault. Mapping of the lower zone incorporated information from Bunting et al. (1987).","The lower zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex is named like this because it lies structurally and stratigraphically beneath the middle zone and is distinguished by its dominant melanocratic assemblages. Previously, these rocks have been referred to as the 'Lower Zone' and 'Gabbronorite Zone' of the 'Kockalocka Layered Series' (Scowen, 1991).  The type section is a traverse from west to east from site TJIWIN000336 (Zone 50, MGA 611363E 6789091N) to TJIWIN000326 (Zone 50, MGA 612891E 6789239N) on BUNGAR. In this section megacyclical layering is evident on a hectometre scale. Each cycle typically comprises a basal serpentinized peridotite that grades to pyroxenite, hornblende gabbronorite, and leucogabbro, with each lithology measuring approximately 30 m in vertical thickness. Each of the lithologies contains up to 10% modal igneous hornblende, with additional amphibole present in metamorphosed areas. The basal part of the middle commences about halfway along the nominated traverse (near Zone 50, MGA 612274 6789170). The contact is relatively inconspicuous, but it represents a change from dominantly melanocratic to dominantly mesocratic zones of the complex. See also Locality 5.2 (Ivanic, 2016).",,"The lower zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex is composed primarily of peridotitic, pyroxenitic, and gabbronoritic lithologies. Each component may contain up to 15% igneous hornblende. The zone contains is a higher abundance of ultramafic lithologies (~30 %) than the overlying middle zone (~10 %). Constituent lithologies are interlayered on a 20-30 m vertical scale. They form repeating megacycles on an approximately 100 m vertical scale. These megacycles have ultramafic bases and mesocratic middle to upper sections, with leucocratic, and locally anorthositic, tops. Troctolitic layers are also present. Oxide-rich horizons associated with ultramafic lithologies of the lower zone have also been noted (e.g. TJIUMF160022, Zone 50, MGA 626885E 6780512N).  The mafic rocks of the lower zone are meso- to orthocumulates with 4-10 mm long cumulate crystal size. Pyroxene and hornblende typically form 6-25 mm long oikocrysts, which are interstitial to plagioclase and olivine. Ultramafic rocks are meso- to adcumulates with 3-6 mm long olivine and 8-20 mm long pyroxene crystals.  Rocks of the lower zone have been modified by deformation and metamorphism. The majority of olivine is serpentinized and the bulk of pyroxene is partially pseudomorphed by tremolite-actinolite. Plagioclase is pervasively replaced by epidote-group minerals in places. Where igneous textures have been obliterated, commonly in strongly deformed regions, rocks have serpentine-talc-tremolite-actinolite-chlorite-epidote-chlorite-magnetite assemblages.  Scowen (1991) described chemical variation based on limited drillcore. Olivine varies between Fo80 and Fo65 and pyroxene between Mg# 84 and Mg# 67. Hornblende is termed 'calcic' and varies from more calcic to more ferroan pargasite upwards in the stratigraphy of the lower zone. Valetich (2011) reported Mg# variation in amphibole from approximately 78 to 70, and plagioclase compositions ranging from An85 to An70. ",,1500,2250,,"In the southeastern part of the lower zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex, gabbroic rocks can be seen to be interleaved with metasedimentary rafts of the Norie Group (TJIWIN090546, Zone 50, MGA 630179E 6787243N). The metasedimentary rocks are cordierite rich and form granoblastic xenoliths within gabbros of the lower zone in places (TJIUMF160009, Zone 50, MGA 632427E 6805557N). The metamorphism is probably contact metamorphism caused by intrusion of the Narndee Igneous Complex. Farther to the southeast, a large granitic intrusion assigned to the Rothsay Suite (A-ANR-mgsm) intrudes the lower zone.  To the northwest of the lower zone an unexposed, northerly trending lineament is interpreted as representing a faulted contact with the ultramafic zone. The lower zone appears to have a conformable contact with the overlying middle zone, i.e. it is parallel to the igneous layering.  To the west of the lower zone, abundant crosscutting intrusions of Mount Kenneth Suite metagranitic rocks (A-ANK-mg, e.g. TJIWIN000750, Zone 50, MGA 610703E 6793971N) form small plugs and dykes, and larger apophyses, which excise 100 m-scale rafts of amphibolitized gabbro and ultramafic rocks of the lower zone in places. Dykes of porphyritic rhyolite of the Mount Kenneth Suite (A-ANK-gnap) also crosscut both these metagranitic rocks and rocks of the lower zone.  In the southwest of the lower zone, there are possible hybrid rocks adjacent to dated metagranitic intrusions of the Mount Kenneth Suite (e.g. TJIWIN000917, Zone 50, MGA 611891E 6785453N).

It lies conformably on top of the lower zone. The dominant rock types are hornblende-bearing gabbronorite interlayered with pyroxenite, and minor peridotite and leucogabbro, which are interlayered on a metre to decametre scale. Seven megacycles are recognized in total, which typically grade upwards from peridotite/pyroxenite at the base to leucogabbro at the top over 0.1 - 1 km vertical thickness.  The middle zone is located in the innermost parts of the complex, in an area approximately 15 km in diameter. It also forms dykes that intrude into the ultramafic zone in the northwest (A-ANnm-oml) of the complex. The main body of the middle zone is surrounded to the west, south, and east by the lower zone and it is in contact with a faulted region of roof rocks to the north. These roof rocks are mainly metagranitic rocks of the Mount Kenneth Suite and metasedimentary rocks of the Norie Group. The uppermost parts of the middle zone have igneous layering that is shallower in dip (~20-10&deg;) compared to the rest of the complex (~60-30&deg;), reflecting its overall conical/bowl shape.  A hornblende gabbronorite from the middle zone has been dated at 2799 Â± 7Ma.    ","The middle zone is located in the central part of outcrop of the Narndee Igneous Complex, and is surrounded to the east, south, and west by the lower zone. To the north it is in contact with metagranitic rocks of the Mount Kenneth Suite and metasedimentary siliciclastic rocks of the Norie Group. Sheets of leucogabbronorite of the middle zone intrude ultramafic zone rocks to the northwest of the main outcrops of the middle zone. The zone has been mapped on the southern part of the COOLAMANINU and northern part of BUNGAR. Mapping of the middle zone incorporated information from Bunting et al. (1987).","The middle zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex is so named because of its stratigraphic situation above the lower zone and its mainly mesocratic assemblages. A leucocratic upper zone has not been identified and may be detached or eroded away. Scowen (1991) called rocks of the middle zone the 'Cyclic Zone' of the 'Kockalocka Layered Series', and divided them into seven 0.1 - 1 km thick megacycles.  The type section for the middle zone is a traverse from west to east from TJIWIN000336 (Zone 50, MGA 611363E 6789091N) to TJIWIN000326 (Zone 50, MGA 612891E 6789239N) on BUNGAR. In this section, which starts in the lower zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex, cyclical layering is evident on a hectometre scale. Each cycle typically starts with a basal serpentinized peridotite and evolves through pyroxenite to leucogabbro, with each lithology comprising about 30 m of vertical stratigraphic thickness. Each of the lithologies contains up to 15% modal igneous hornblende. The basal part of the middle zone begins about half way along the traverse (around Zone 50, MGA 612274 6789170). The contact is subtle but it represents a change from dominantly melanocratic to dominantly mesocratic zones of the complex. See also locality 5.2 in Ivanic (2016).",,"The middle zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex comprises predominantly hornblende-bearing gabbro interlayered with pyroxenite, and minor peridotite and leucogabbro. The lithologies are interlayered on a metre to kilometre scale. Large-scale cyclical layering forms approximately seven similar megacycles (Scowen, 1991), which typically grade upwards from peridotite/pyroxenite at the base to leucogabbro at the top over 0.1-1 km vertical thickness (e.g. TJIWIN000321, Zone 50, MGA 615968E 6788209N). Hornblende gabbro (A-ANnm-oh) is the dominant rock type. It has a distinctive spotted appearance due to 8-25 mm hornblende oikocrysts. Minor troctolite in the upper part of the megacyclic units is more abundant in this zone than in the lower zone.   Layering within the middle zone is more shallowly dipping at the top (~10&deg; compared to ~30&deg; at the base). Layering at the top of the middle zone is more contorted than that at lower levels, possibly because it is near the roof. It may also have been affected by faulting and intrusion of granitic rocks.  The majority of the middle zone is composed of orthocumulates comprising ultramafic lithologies with locally preserved adcumulate and mesocumulate textures. Metaperidotites have 3-6 mm olivine cumulate crystals with larger crystals of interstitial pyroxene, typically with a mesocumulate texture. Pyroxenites are typically adcumulates with 20 mm grain size. Mafic lithologies are characterized by orthocumulate texture with 3-8 mm cumulate crystals of plagioclaseÂ±olivine with 5-15 mm interstitial pyroxeneÂ±hornblende, but locally as oikocrysts up to 25 mm. All lithologies may contain minor cumulus magnetiteÂ±ilmenite and/or accessory interstitial phlogopiteÂ±apatite.  Metamorphism of the middle zone is particularly evident in the roof region adjacent to metagranitic rocks of the Mount Kenneth Suite (A-ANK-mg), which crosscut the middle zone. Here the pseudomorphing and/or recrystallization of gabbroic rocks has produced actinolite-epidote-chlorite assemblages (e.g. TJIWIN000705, Zone 50, 617605E 3789294N).  Chemical variation recorded by Scowen (1991) from limited drillcore from the middle zone shows that olivine ranges between Fo78 and Fo65 and Mg# in pyroxene between 82 and 60. Reversals to more magnesian compositions are noted at the bases of several of the cycles. Amphibole is close to hornblende in composition and, according to Scowen (1991), it varies from more calcic to more ferroan pargasite upwards in the stratigraphy of the middle zone. Valetich (2011) recorded Mg# variation in amphibole from approximately 72 to 53 and plagioclase compositional variation from An80 to An62.  Whole-rock AFM compositions in the middle zone fall in the tholeiitic field (Scowen, 1991), but are not iron enriched. It has distinctly fractionated light rare earth element compositions compared to the ultramafic and lower zones. These characteristic and mineralogical similarities were the reason why abundant leucogabbronorite dykes (A-ANnm-oml), which crosscut the ultramafic zone, have been assigned to the middle zone.",,,,,"The lowermost middle zone cumulate rocks of the Narndee Igneous Complex lie directly over lower zone cumulate rocks with highly stratiform, conformable geometry. This contact is not distinct in the field and represents an overall progression from more melanocratic rocks of the lower zone to dominantly mesocratic rocks of the middle zone. The contact dips concentrically towards the interior of the complex at approximately 35&deg;.  Exposed intrusive contacts between the middle zone rocks and Norie Group rocks are rare. The Norie Group rocks in the vicinity include volcaniclastic rocks of the Yaloginda Formation (e.g. TJIWIN000242, Zone 50, MGA 623112E 6794763N).  Metagranitic plutons of the Mount Kenneth Suite, typically 5 km in diameter, crosscut the middle zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex (e.g. at site TJIWIN090050, Zone 50, MGA 621706E 6794274N). This is most evident in the northern and western parts of the middle zone. Swarms of northwesterly trending rhyolitic dykes (A-ANK-gnap) crosscut both the middle zone and these metagranitic rocks (e.g. TJIWIN000732, Zone 50, MGA 620856E 6797069N).",,8,,,Mixed,5,,,,2799,,2799,,"Hornblende gabbro of the middle zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex (A-ANnm-oh) has been dated at 2799 Â± 7 Ma (GSWA 191056, Ivanic et al. 2010).

It is currently the best estimate for the age of the Boodanoo Suite.  Granodiorite of the Mount Kenneth Suite (A-ANK-mg) intruded the middle zone at 2811 Â± 7 Ma (GSWA 193967, Wingate et al., 2012a).

The dominant lithologies are pyroxene peridotite interlayered with olivine pyroxenite and gabbronorite. These locally grade into mafic-ultramafic rocks with hornblende (and minor phlogopite) as oikocrysts around pyroxene and olivine. This zone hosts Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization within sulfide-bearing ultramafic rocks.","The ultramafic zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex forms a northerly trending, elongate unit, approximately 5.5 km wide and 16 km long on COOLAMANINU. It lies east of Norie Group greenstones (A-NO-xmb-f) and to the north of the western portion of the lower zone of the complex. Exposure is sparse and highly oxidized, with extensive, thick lateritic cover. The zone is best exposed in the vicinity of Milgoo Peak (Zone 50, MGA 610201E 6807236N). Geological mapping incorporated data from Bunting et al. (1987) and Scowen (1991).","The ultramafic zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex is so named because of its predominantly peridotitic lithologies. Previously, these rocks were called the 'Milgoo Layered Series' (Scowen, 1991), and subdivided into 'Layered Zone 1', 'Layered Zone 2', and 'Gabbroic Zone'. Due to a lack of way-up information in these rocks, the current classification (i.e. ultramafic zone) does not allow further subdivisions.  The type locality is in an area around site TJIWIN090207 (Zone 50, MGA 609015E 6806336N). Here, the most voluminous lithology of the ultramafic zone, olivine pyroxenite (A-ANnu-ao), can be seen in contact with crosscutting gabbronorite of the middle zone. Also in the surrounding area are crosscutting granitic plugs and dykes of the Mount Kenneth Suite (A-ANK-mg). Adjacent outcrops are of pyroxene peridotite (A-ANnu-ap) and melanocratic gabbroic rocks of the lower zone. Other outcrop localities are described in Ivanic (2016), locality 5.1. ",,"The ultramafic zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex is composed principally of olivine pyroxenite (A-ANnu-ao) with lesser pyroxene peridotite (A-ANnu-ap) and metadunite (A-ANnu-mad). Minor orthopyroxenite (A-ANnu-axo) and rare chromitite (A-ANnu-ac) are also present. These lithologies vary modally to gabbronorite and melagabbronorite. All rock types within this zone may contain hornblende as an intercumulus phase. Accessory interstitial phlogopite has also been noted in drillcore (Scowen, 1991).  Lithologies of the ultramafic zone are coarsely layered on a 0.5 - 1 km scale and internal modal layering is evident on a 10 m scale (e.g. TJIWIN090239, Zone 50, MGA 608747E 6804758N). Olivine-rich lithologies, metadunite, and pyroxene peridotite are prevalent in the northeast of the ultramafic zone, suggesting overall igneous fractionation towards the southeast (hence, the likely way-up). However, precise relationships between these lithologies are difficult to determine due to poor exposure and deep oxidative weathering.   The ultramafic zone is crosscut by numerous and voluminous sheets and dykes of leucogabbro and gabbronorite, and minor anorthosite (e.g. TJIWIN090210, Zone 50, MGA 609849E 6805870N). These units (e.g. A-ANnm-oml; A-ANnm-oa) are assigned to the middle zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex due to their lithological and geochemical similarities with components of that zone.  Metamorphism has affected the majority of exposed rocks of the ultramafic zone. Serpentine-group minerals have replaced olivine and amphiboles have commonly partially pseudomorphed pyroxenes and hornblende. Minor plagioclase is also epidotized in these areas. Metamorphic amphibole adjacent to pyroxene is differentiated from primary igneous amphibole by its polycrystalline and microcrystalline habit with dominant tremolite-actinolite. Metamorphism is much more pervasive in sheared rocks, which are more common towards the margins of the main body of the ultramafic zone. Talc-chlorite-tremolite-magnetiteÂ±serpentine is the dominant metamorphic assemblage in the schistose rocks.  Several reversals in the mineral chemostratigraphy of the zone are reported by Scowen (1991), who also observed that there is no overall fractionation trend evident in the drillholes analysed. Olivine compositions vary between Fo78 and Fo87, and pyroxenes between Mg# of 75 and 88. Whole-rock compositions plot mainly within the tholeiitic field on an AFM diagram, with a few compositions that are transitional to calc-alkaline.  ",,1000,2000,,"The ultramafic zone hosts 100 m-sized rafts of Norie Group metasedimentary rocks at its western margin (e.g. TJIWIN000027, Zone 50, MGA 606764E 6807797N). These rafts are interpreted to have been incorporated from the greenstones to the west and probably represent detached wallrocks to the Narndee Igneous Complex.  Abundant dykes of gabbronoritic rocks of the middle zone (e.g. A-ANwm-oml, A-ANwm-oa) with a northwesterly orientation crosscut the ultramafic zone. Exposed contacts show coarse-grained and pegmatitic gabbro with local spinifex texture (e.g. TJIWIN090210, Zone 50, MGA 609849E 6805870N) at their margins. This indicates quenching against ultramafic zone rocks.  No identifiable igneous contact is preserved between rocks of the ultramafic zone and those of the lower zone of the Narndee Igneous Complex. However, a region in the western part of the lower zone may represent transitional lithologies (e.g. TJIWIN000005, Zone 50, MGA 609911E 6788969N). The ultramafic zone appears to be in faulted contact with the lower and middle zones in the south, with faults marked by discontinuities in the aeromagnetic data. The contacts are not exposed.  Metamorphosed tonalitic rocks of the Mount Kenneth Suite crosscut the ultramafic zone as small plutons, plugs, and glassy porphyritic dykes (A-ANK-mg; A-ANK-gnap). Larger expanses of this suite to the southwest and northwest of the ultramafic zone enclose large, kilometre-scale rafts of metamorphosed ultramafic zone rocks.   The ultramafic zone is in contact with unassigned metagabbro of the Narndee Igneous Complex to the north (A-ANna-jmog-md). The metagabbro is interleaved with metasedimentary rocks of the Norie Group and intruded by syndeformational Tuckanarra Suite metagranitic rocks (e.g. A-TUcu-mgmu) near the ultramafic zone.

Sedimentary structures include ripple marks and cross bedding and the unit is common silicified. The depositional environment is thought to be marine and outcrops are found along the base of the Perth hills from Maddington to Serpentine.","The unit has been mapped along the base of the Perth hills from Maddington to Serpentine (Playford et al., 1976). The thickest section known is from the Cardup Quarry whre it is 73.4m thick.",Named after Neerigen Brook near Armadale.,,"The Nerrigen Formation comprises fine- to medium-grained micaceous sandstone interbedded with fissile shale beds that may have ripple marks. The sandstones are thin to medium bedded and may display cross-bedding. The colour of both the sandstone and shale beds is typically white to light grey, but may be purple to red brown. Silicification is common. At the Armadale Quarry (116.0197 E, -32.1575 S), Gozzard (2007) notes the presence of granular quartz grains in the basal sandstone and rare slightly rounded grains of epidote and microcline.    The top of the formation at the Armadale Quarry also has a thin (80 cm) carbonate bed (Gozzard, 2007). Just beneath the carbonate layer stromatolites are recorded by Fairbridge (1953) who placed them in the lower part of the Armadale Shale. However, Gozzard (2007) places them near the top of the Neerigen Formation confined to a single layer. Gozzard (2007) further wrote... Grey (1987) described the stromatolites as hemispherical, slightly flattened domes, characterized by wavy laminae and fenestrae, with wave crests superimposed across several laminae. The domes are 15-50 cm in diameter and some are elongate, probably caused by the action of water currents.  Fairbridge (1953) reported these fossils as Collenia-like, but this was considered incorrect by Grey (1987).   Playford et al. (1976) provide a description of the formation, at the type section, as follows: The section is 23.6 metres thick, with the lowermost section comprising 7.6 metres of white to reddish-brown micaceous, ripple-marked shale. The shale is intercalated with white and reddish-brown siltstone and white, thinly-bedded, fine-grained, partly silicified to fissile sandstone. The upper 16 m is dominated by fine-grained, pinkish-white, weathering yellow-brown thinly bedded sandstone. The sandstone contains rare 0.25-1 mm subrounded to subangular quartz grains. The upper portion of the sandstone contains some thin beds of white to reddish-brown micaceous shale.   Playford et al. (1976) and Low (1972) both provide a location for the type section as a road cutting north of the &ldquo;Olde Narrogin Inn&rdquo;, Armadale. The given coordinates for the type section in both reports conflict and do not plot within the 300m distance from the Inn as suggested by Playford et al. (1976). The distance provided by Low is 274 km north of the Inn, however this is likely to be error in the units and should be metres. Current aerial photography shows the area to be heavily developed with residential housing and it is possible that the road cutting has since been redeveloped and no longer exists. ","The presence of epidote, microcline and quartz are consistent with derivation from the adjacent and underlying granitic Archean Craton.

The tonalites and granodiorites are composed of subhedral granular plagioclase, biotite and minor microperthite, with phenocrystic and interstitial quartz, and accessory apatite, zircon, allanite and rare opaque minerals. Extinction angles on plagioclase twins indicate weak normal zoning from andesine to oligoclase. Most of the accessory minerals form euhedral inclusions in biotite, although fine-grained tonalites commonly contain abundant acicular apatite within quartz. Fine-grained diorites and quartz diorites are composed of plagioclase, hornblende or actinolite, biotite and quartz, with minor amounts of opaque minerals, and accessory apatite and zircon.  Small mafic clots, less than 3 cm in diameter, are widespread in the Neville Granodiorite. They are composed of intergrowths of decussate plagioclase-biotite(-accessories).

Based on aeromagnetic images, the igneous complex is interpreted to extend from Campbell Well (Zone 51, MGA 340450E 6781340N) in eastern MELITA, to the western part of YERILLA, southeast of the township of Kookynie. Witt (1994) interpreted two main mafic bodies: one north of Campbell Rockhole (Zone 51, MGA 340515E 6750850N) and another centred on the Niagara mining area (Zone 51, MGA 346200E 6749900N).

This is taken to be the type area.",,"The Niagara Igneous Complex contains one or more variably deformed and metamorphosed layered mafic intrusions. The main rock types are adcumulate-textured gabbronorite and anorthositic gabbro, and dolerite and Fe-rich quartz diorite. Rocks are commonly strongly altered with primary pyroxene commonly altered to amphibole and chlorite (Witt, 1994). Gabbro from near the type locality contains altered pyroxene and sodic plagioclase, and accessory minerals including magnetite, titanite and zircon with secondary epidote and saussurite (GSWA 105822 and GSWA 105823 in Libby, 1991a). The pyroxene was initially thought to be aegerine-augite but SEM analysis showed it to be hedenbergite (Libby, 1991b), which is consistent with the observation that the rock appears strongly metasomatized.  Another rock from near the type locality (GSWA 211060, JKSEGS000018, Zone 51, MGA 345833E 6749738N) is medium grained and contains quartz, plagioclase, hornblende and epidote. Although strongly altered, and the protolith is difficult to recognize, it may be a metasomatized granodiorite (A Verbeeten, Minerex Petrographic Services, 2015, written comm., 10 September).  Although there are no exposed ultramafic rocks in the interpreted Niagara Igneous Complex, Witt (1994) suggested that a prominent magnetic anomaly under laterite northeast of Kurnalpi Dam (Zone 51, MGA 338340E 6752735N) may represent an ultramafic component. Another prominent magnetic anomaly just south of Kookynie School Bore (Zone 51, MGA 354280E 6752520N) may also represent an ultramafic component of the igneous complex.

A porphyritic rhyolite that intrudes the base of the formation southeast of Mount Ragal was dated at 3251 +/- 6 Ma (GSWA 118975, Nelson, 1997). This might define the minimum depositional age of the basal section of the formation. Alternatively, if this date was calculated on a zircon group that included xenocrystic zircon derived from the Karratha Granodiorite the age is too old; the youngest concordant grains in GSWA 118975 are c. 3220 Ma, which may be the emplacement age of the rhyolite. A depositional age of c. 3220 Ma for the Nickol River Formation is most consistent with the evidence that it was one of four sedimentary basins formed as a result of the East Pilbara Terrane Rifting Event (3220-3165 Ma).  The minimum age of the formation is constrained by the fact that it was extensively deformed by the Regal Thrust. This thrust is interpreted to have originated at c. 3160 Ma based on a metamorphic event in the underlying Karratha Terrane. The Nickol River Formation is tentaively correlated with the Dixon Island Formation at Cleaverville, from which a felsic tuff was dated at 3195 +/- 15 Ma (Kiyokawa et al., 2002). It will be noted that the maximum and minimum ages of the Nickol River Formation overlap with those of the Regal Formation. This is explained by the Regal Formation being erupted in the cental area of the c. 3200 Ma central Pilbara rift basin while the Nickol River Formation was deposited on its northwest margin. Clastic deposition on the southeast margin of this rift basin gave rise to the post-3228 Ma Soanesville Group.",No,,,586,,No,Approved for DE,Yes,Yes,A,_nk,,266,6,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,,No,No

It is a hard, pale coloured bioclastic calcarenite, generally poorly bedded to unbedded, and is of late early to early middle Miocene age. A widespread basal facies of microbial nodular limestone has been named the Mullamullang Member. The limestone was deposited during the Miocene eustatic high stand, between 14 and 17 Ma, in warm waters at depths of up to about 100 m. O'Connell (2011) interpreted much of the Nullarbor Limestone as the product of deposition in sea-grass banks, with mechanically deposited rhodoliths forming the Mullamullang Member seaward of the banks. The presently preserved thickness ranges up to about 30 m, but another 30 to 60 m may have been removed since the Miocene by rainfall on the plain. The most comprehensive descriptions are by Lowry (1970) and O'Connell (2011). It is part of the Eucla Group, together with the Abrakurrie Limestone, Colville Sandstone, and Plumridge Formation.","The Nullarbor Limestone extends over most of the onshore Eucla Basin. It slightly less extensive than the Eocene Wilson Bluff Limestone, and is notably absent in the southwest corner where there is a transition to siliciclastic deposits. The thickness as compiled by Lowry (1970) ranges up to 32 m in Old Homestead Cave south southwest of Forrest. Lowry estimated that 30 to 60 m of Nullarbor Limestone has been eroded by rainfall on the plain since deposition ceased in the Miocene.  The Nullarbor Limestone grades laterally northwards into the Colville Sandstone, an inboard, more siliciclastic unit that was deposited in intertidal to supratidal environments (Lowry, 1970, Li et al., 2003).","The name 'Nullarbor Limestone' was initially used for all the limestone succession beneath the Nullarbor Plain (Brown, 1885), but later was later restricted essentially to the present usage by Singleton (1954). Singleton did not nominate a type section, but Ludbrook (1958) suggested a section at Wilson Bluff that had been measured by Tate (1879). Lowry subsequently suggested a 46 ft (14 m) section 1.2 miles (1.93 km) to the east, noted this was poorly exposed, and proposed a 58 ft (17.7 m) reference section in Mullamullang Cave. The top of all sections is the present day Nullarbor Plain. The Mullamullang Member is a microbial limestone that is present at the base of the Nullarbor Limestone west of Wilson Bluff.",,"The descriptions following are derived from Lowry (1970) and O'Connell (2011), both of whom exhaustively described the Nullarbor Limestone.  The Nullarbor Limestone is a hard, pale coloured bioclastic calcarenite, generally poorly bedded to unbedded. Cross bedding is rare. Foraminifers and coralline algae are the principal bioclasts, with lesser bryozoans, molluscs and fragmental echinoids. O'Connell (2011) recognized five facies associations: Rhodolith (Mullamullang Member), Echinoderm, Articulated Coralline Algae, Benthic Foraminifera, and Benthic-Planktonic Foraminifera Facies Associations, each characteristic of a distinct depositional setting.   North of the Trans-Australian Railway Line, intraclastic medium- to coarse-grained foraminiferal calcarenite, with intraclasts of foraminiferal calcarenite derived from elsewhere in the Nullarbor Limestone, indicates syndepositional reworking by waves and currents, presumably in shallower conditions. The fauna indicate deposition in subtropical waters, rather than the cool temperate conditions of underlying units.   A widespread basal facies of microbial nodular limestone has been named the Mullamullang Member.","O'Connell (2011) considered the Nullarbor Limestone formed as seagrass banks, rhodolith gravels, and on open sea floors on an epieric marine ramp that extended about 450 km inboard from the shelf edge. Paleodepths were up to about 100 m, the base of the photic zone. The open sea floor environment was below wave base, seaward of the moderate depth wave- and current-swept setting in which the rhodolith gravels accumulated. Sea grass banks developed in the shallowest setting where wave energy was largely dissipated or baffled. Diverse corals, large benthic forminifers and micritic envelopes around bioclasts indicate sub-tropical water temperatures despite the mid-latitude setting (~38 0 S). There was a Miocene warm climatic spike (the Miocene Climatic Optimum), but  an eastwards decrease in tropical faunal components indicates the seawater temperatures were accentuated by a south-, then east-flowing longshore marine current, the ancestral Leeuwin Current (O'Connell, 2011).",,32,,,,17,,,,4,,,,17,,14,,"The age of the Nullarbor Limestone is reasonably well constrained by foraminifers and other fossils (Lowry, 1970, O'Connell, 2011).

The most complete section is preserved on the southeastern flank of the Hardey Syncline on HARDEY, where Martin et al.

The Cheela Springs Basalt was subsequently upgraded to formation status (Horwitz, 1980) and the Nummana Member was then included within the lower part of that stratigraphy (Martin et al., 2000). Despite general recognition of the relative stratigraphic position of this unit, on existing map sheets the Nummana Member has been included within the Beasley River Quartzite (e.g. Blight et al., 1986; Thorne et al., 1991, 1995). The Nummana Member is now recognized as a subunit of the Cheela Springs Basalt.  The Nummana Member was named after Nummana Pool (Zone 50, MGA 516400E 7471500N) on the Beasley River on ROCKLEA. A type section was not clearly defined by de la Hunty (1964); however, the member is well exposed around Zone 50, MGA 489000E 7470900N on the southeastern part of HARDEY.",,"The Nummana Member is composed of siltstone, interbedded with quartz sandstone and basalt. The succession is commonly intruded by sills of the Balgara Dolerite (P_-_bg-od).   Published descriptions of the Nummana Member are brief.

It comprises mudstone and siltstone, overlain by ripple-laminated fine-grained sandstone, and trough cross-stratified, ferruginous sandstone. Martin et al.

The formation is unconformable on crystalline rocks of the western zone of the Lamboo Province, resting on the underlying Whitewater Volcanics (or locally granitic intrustions of the Paperbark Supersuite) and is conformable with the overlying Speewah Basin sedimentary rocks (Tunganary Formation). The O'Donnell Formation is a fining-upward sedimentary siliciclastic succession of coarse-grained, quartz-rich sandstone and pebble conglomerate overlain by siltstone and shale interbedded with minor fine- to medium-grained quartz-rich sandstones. It is intruded by sills of the Hart Dolerite. It has a maximum depositonal age of 1864 Â± 4 Ma, based on the youngest population of detrital zircon (Kirkland et al., 2010).","The O'Donnell Formation outcrops along the edges of the Lamboo Province, observed on the following 1:250 000 map sheets: CHARNLEY, LANSDOWNE, DIXON RANGE, LISSADELL, MOUNT RAMSAY, LENNARD RIVER, and possibly on YAMPI (undifferentiated Speewah Group).","The derivation of the name of the O Donnell Formation is questionable. The formation is possibly named after outcrops near the O Donnell Range in the Wilson and Bow Rivers area (east of the Durack Range on the LISSADELL 1:250 000 map sheet) or exposures in the O Donnell River area (a tributary of the Margaret River in the Mueller Ranges). The formation was first described in the first edition of the DIXON RANGE 1:250 000 explanatory notes, Sheet SE/52-6 (Dow and Gemuts, 1967).",,"In some areas the O'Donnell Formation can be divided into two informal units. The lower unit is a succession of medium- to coarse-grained, well-sorted, quartz and lithic sandstone with basal polymictic granule and pebble conglomerate. These coarse clastics fine upwards into an upper unit of grey or green laminated siltstone, occasionally micaceous, interbedded with fine- to medium-grained quartz-rich sandstones (Roberts et al., 1968; Sheppard et al., 1999).  Sandstones in both the upper and lower units may be locally glauconitic or ferruginous (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967; Griffin et al., 1993). Thick-bedded sandstones commonly preserve planar or trough cross-bedding with foresets up to 2-3 m thick (Griffin et al., 1993). The overlying siltstone-dominated lithofacies contains local magnetite-bearing and tourmaline-rich beds (Gellatly et al., 1969) with planar parallel or cross-laminations (Thorne et al., 1999). The O'Donnell Formation becomes sandier to the west on the LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 sheet (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967) whereas the basal conglomeratic facies in the lower unit fines to the west on the CHARNLEY 1:250 000 sheet (Gellatly et al., 1969).  The lower unit locally contains a feldspar porphyry on the LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 sheet (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967) while a rhyolite porphyry is noted on the DIXON RANGE 1:250 000 sheet (Dow and Gemuts, 1967). Clasts of felsic porphyry are commonly found in pebble conglomerates within the lower sandstone unit on the LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 sheet (Griffin et al., 1993).","The fining-upward cycle from coarse-grained lithics to siltstones and shales is indicative to lessening current strengths within a purported fluvial system - perhaps from a channel to overbank setting. Normal grading within the sandstone-siltstone interbeds of the upper siltstone unit suggests a quiescent environment punctuated by episodic higher current energy events, possibly flooding events. The ocurrence of the quartz-rich sandstone in both the upper and lower units suggests that the clastic source had a mature, continental province.",20,259,,"The O'Donnell Formation marks the beginning of continuous and conformable sedimentation within the Speewah Basin and Speewah Group. The sandstones and coarse clastics of the lower formation are unconformable on the underlying Whitewater Volcanics and may be unconformable on Paperbark Supersuite granites throughout the Kimberley region. On the LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 sheet and other areas in the west Kimberley region, however, the O'Donnell Formation is in fault contact with the Whitewater Volcanics along the Ingllis Fault, a shallow to steeply northeast dipping shear zone (Griffin et al., 1993; Sheppard et al., 2012). The O'Donnell Formation is intruded by the Hart Dolerite at all stratigraphic levels.",,17,,,,4,,,,1814,,1791,,"The O'Donnell Formation is the oldest unit in the Speewah Group unconformably overlying or in fault contact with the Whitewater Volcanics of the Western Zone of the Lamboo Province. Felsic volcanic rocks from the Whitewater Volcanics which have yielded igneous crystallisation ages of 1857 Â± 4, 1854 Â± 5 (Griffin et al., 2000), 1854 Â± 6 (Lu et al., 2016) and 1849 Â± 6 Ma (Worden et al., 2008). Griffin et al. (2000) suggest that these indistinguishable ages indicate contemporaneous felsic volcanism over a strike length of more than 600 km in the western Lamboo Province.   Detrital zircon geochronology of a sandstone samples from the O'Donnell Formation yielded a maximum depositonal age of 1864 Â± 4 Ma (GSWA 182107, Kirkland et al., 2010). However, this age is older than the underlying volcanics rocks. Detrital zircon geochronology from the Tunganary Formation , which conformably overlies the O Donnell Formation, reported a maximum depositional age from a weighted mean 207Pb*/206Pb* date of 1814 Â± 10 Ma from a population of seven young grains with the youngest detrital zircon dated at 1803 Â± 12 Ma (1&sigma;) (GS11031-2, Ramsay et al., 2017). The age of the youngest population at c. 1814 Ma is therefore considered a best estimate for the maximum age of the O'Donnell Formation and Speewah Group.  The Hart Dolerite extensively intrudes the Speewah Group (including the O'Donnell Formation) and lower Kimberley Group. Sills of Hart Dolerite and considered to be contiguous with basalt lava in the Carson Volcanics (Kimberley Group) and together constitute the Hart-Carson Large Igneous Province (Sheppard et al., 2012). Sheppard et al. (2012) reported U-Pb ages from a granophyric unit within the Hart Dolerite at 1799 Â± 17 Ma from zircon (GA 8759.8003) and 1795 Â± 15 Ma from baddeleyite (GSWA 113574). A minimum age of 1791 Â± 8 Ma was provided from sample GSWA 206156 by Wingate et al. (in prep). The minimum age of the Hart Dolerite at c. 1791 Ma is considered a reasonable minimum age of deposition for the Speewah Group. ",No,,,6,,No,DE in Progress,No,No,P_,SPn,,,,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,,No,No

3416,14563,P_-_oy-se,1,Olympic Formation,1,"Diamictite, sandstone, conglomerate, and siltstone; large erratics; common glacially faceted and striated clasts","The Olympic Formation is a glacigene unit correlated with the end Cryogenian Elatina ( Marinoan ) glaciation (Preiss et al., 1978; Hill et al., 2011; Edgoose, 2013). Most outcrops are in the northeastern Amadeus Basin in the Northern Territory (NT), with the only know exposures in Western Australia (WA) being restricted to the Boord Ridges in the northeastern MACDONALD 1:250 000 map sheet area where the unit is up to 100 m thick (Haines and Allen, 2014). At this locality the formation is characterised by glacial diamictite, but includes interbeds of sandstone, siltstone and conglomerate. The diamictite contains a wide variety of clast types, including erratics up to 2 m in length. Many clasts can be matched to underlying units of the Amadeus Basin, but also include crystalline basement rocks. Facets and striations indicative of glacial transport are common. A basal angular unconformity over the Aralka Formation is clearly exposed at the Boord Ridges, but the upper contact with the Pertatataka Formation is covered (the contact is conformable in the NT). A 'cap carbonate', commonly in the NT, is not exposed at the Boord Ridges. The Olympic Formation is of Cryogenian age, being further constrained to 640-635 Ma base on international dating of the Elatina glaciation. The unit forms the local base of Supersequence 3 of the Centralian Superbasin (Supersequence terminology of Walter et al., 1995).","The Olympic Formation is mainly recognised in the northeastern Amadeus Basin in the NT, where it is inferred to interfinger with the Pioneer Sandstone. An equivalent unit is likely present within the Inindia beds of the southern and western NT Amadeus Basin. In WA the Olympic Formation is only recognised in outcrop in the Boord Ridges area of the northeast MACDONALD 1:250 000 scale map sheet (Haines and Allen, 2014). However, it is probably more widespread in the subsurface in the northern part of the WA Amadeus Basin, but likely eroded before deposition of the Carnegie Formation in the south.","The  Olympic Member  of the original conception of the Pertatataka Formation was defined by Wells et al. (1967) in the northeastern Amadeus Basin in the NT. The unit was raised to formation status when the Pertatataka Formation was revised by Preiss et al. (1978). The name was derived from Olympic Bore, and the type sect is 8 km southeast of Ringwood homestead where it is 192 m thick (Wells et al., 1967) (both localities on ALICE SPRINGS 1:250 000 map sheet area, NT). In the NT the Olympic Formation is interpreted to be coeval with, and interfinger with, the Pioneer Sandstone (Preiss et al. 1978; Hill et al., 2011), which is not recognized in WA.",,"In the outcrops of the Boord Ridges the Olympic Formation can be subdivided into two units (Haines and Allen, 2014). The lower unit is only present where the basal unconformity of the formation makes significant downcuts into the top of the underlying Aralka Formation. This local lenticular facies comprises a poorly sorted pebbly sandstone unit up to about 30 m in thickness. The more widespread upper unit consists of poorly exposed diamictite with interbeds of sandstone and conglomerate. This upper unit either directly overlies the lower unit or onlaps the unconformity surface away from significant downcuts. Where it overlies the carbonate ridge that is locally preserved at the top of the Aralka Formation, the base is often marked by a poorly exposed and partly calcrete covered boulder conglomerate of pink limestone derived from the carbonate unit below. Clasts in the diamictite include granitic and porphyritic felsic igneous rocks, schistose and gneissic metamorphic rocks, quartzite, sandstone, mudstone, dolomite, limestone and chert. Some stromatolitic carbonate clasts can be matched to the Loves Creek Formation of the Bitter Springs Group and the two stromatolitic horizons of the upper Aralka Formation. The largest erratics, some exceeding 2 m in length, consist of banded pink sandy limestone clearly derived from the ridge-forming carbonate unit of the underlying Aralka Formation. Many clasts, particularly those composed of quartzite, sandstone, and mudstone show well developed facets and striations indicative of glacial transportation. The sandy mudstone matrix of the diamictite is rarely preserved. A  cap carbonate , typical of the Olympic Formation and correlative Pioneer Sandstone elsewhere, has not been recognized in the Boord Ridges area, but this may be a function of poor outcrop, as the contact between the Olympic Formation and overlying Pertatataka Formation is not exposed. ","The local basal pebbly sandstone facies is considered to be of fluvial origin. The overlying diamictite is possibly a glacial moraine, interbedded with outwash facies and other sub-environments.",,100,,"Overlies the Aralka Formation with a low angle unconformity at the Boord Ridges. Overlain by the Pertatataka Formation, but the contact is not exposed in WA; in the NT a 'cap carbonate' is conformably overlain by the Pertatataka Formation at some localities (Hill et al., 2011).

The Olympic Formation is correlated with the end Cryogenian Elatina ( Marinoan ) glaciation (Hill et al., 2011). Based on the assumption of global synchronicity of Neoproterozoic glaciations, the Olympic Formation was probably deposited between c. 640-635 Ma using the most recent international geochronological constraints on the age of this event (Rooney et al., 2015).",No,,,624,,No,DE in Progress,No,No,P_,_oy,,86,9,,MIGSDPH,2.02E+13,,Yes,No
166,14567,P_-HCo-xmt-ml,157,Olympio Formation,1,"Lithic and feldspathic metasandstone, and interbedded metasiltstone and metamudstone; intercalated metamorphosed felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks","The Olympio Formation is the youngest and most widespread unit in the Halls Creek Group of the Eastern Zone of the Lamboo Province. The formation consists of up to 4000 m of immature turbiditic metasandstone and metasiltstone, hemipelagic metasiltstone, and metamudstone with two alkaline metavolcanic members. The contact with the underlying shallow-marine Biscay Formation is marked by an unconformable surface representing basin-wide marine transgression to a deep-marine setting. The dominant lithofacies in the Olympio Formation consists of quartzofeldspathic metasandstone turbidite, which is a thick-bedded, moderately sorted, commonly massive, very fine- to medium-grained subarkose, and feldspathic litharenite. Olympio Formation metasandstone units were probably deposited from unconfined turbidity currents, typical of lower fan settings. Massive or commonly strongly cleaved metasiltstone beds are interbedded with the metasandstone units, which were probably deposited as hemipelagite. Deep-marine sedimentation is punctuated by two members of meta-alkaline volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks. The older Maude Headley Member is located 50-100 m from the base of the Olympio Formation where it consists of meta-andesitic to metatrachytic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks interbedded with metacarbonate breccia and siliciclastic metasedimentary rocks. A porphyritic metafelsic volcanic rock within a pyroclastic flow from the Maude Headley Member has been dated at 1856 Â± 6 Ma. The younger Butchers Gully Member is separated from the Maude Headley Member by hundreds of metres of deep-marine sedimentation. The Butchers Gully Member is composed of meta-andesitic to metatrachytic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks in a metacarbonate-rich matrix. An amygdaloidal metatrachytic pillow lava from the Butchers Gully Member has been dated at 1846 Â± 4 Ma. A metasandstone from the uppermost Olympio Formation yielded a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* maximum depositional age of 1834 Â± 9 Ma.","The Olympio Formation is exposed in a 270 km long north-northeasterly trending belt in the Eastern Zone of the Lamboo Province and is the most abundantly exposed and voluminous formation in the Halls Creek Group. The Olympio Formation is exposed east of the Halls Creek Fault from north of Mount Pitt (TURKEY CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 430331E 8082690N) to south of Mount Dockrell (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 313881E 7921738N).The formation is unconformably overlain by Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic basins to the east.","The Olympio Formation was originally named the Olympio Creek Formation by Ruker (1961) after outcrops near Olympio Creek, about 35 km east-northeast of Halls Creek (Harms, 1959). The Olympio Creek Formation included greywacke, arkose, and siltstone between the underlying Biscay Formation and overlying, younger Proterozoic rocks. Metavolcanic members (Maude Headley Member and Butchers Gully Member) that would later be included in the Olympio Formation were originally assigned to the Biscay Formation, Woodward Dolerite, or undifferentiated felsic metavolcanic rocks in the Lamboo Complex on first edition map sheets (Dow and Gemuts, 1967; Gemuts and Smith, 1968). The formation was renamed the Olypmio Formation by Dow et al. (1964) and Gellatly et al. (1965).",,"The Olympio Formation consists of up to 4000 m of monotonous metasandstone-dominated lithofacies (P_-HCo-mt), metasiltstone-dominated lithofacies (P_-HCo-mh), and rare metacarbonate (P_-HCo-mk) intercalated with two meta-alkaline volcanic members &mdash; the c. 1856 Ma Maude Headley Member (P_-HCov-xmf-md) and c. 1846 Ma Butchers Gully Member (P_-HCob-xmf-mc). Metasedimentary rocks are dominated by variably silty quartz-rich and feldspathic metasandstone (greywacke and feldspathic greywacke), arkose, metasiltstone, and shale. Subordinate lithologies include greenschist facies pebble conglomerate, shale (slate), and limestone. Quartzofeldspathic metasandstone units are abundant on HALLS CREEK, MCINTOSH, and RUBY PLAINS and are composed of thick packages of medium-bedded to very thick-bedded, moderately sorted, very fine-grained to medium-grained arkose, subarkose, and feldspathic sublitharenite. Feldspar is commonly altered to limonite and kaolinite. The proportion of matrix is typically 15-30% and consists of quartz, chlorite, muscovite, sericite, biotite, K-feldspar, plagioclase, and opaque oxides. Accessory minerals include zircon, sphene, tourmaline, and hematite. Lithic clasts 3-10 mm long, can comprise up to 10% of the rock, and are composed of metasiltstone, chert, felsic volcanic fragments, and quartz sandstone. Metasandstone beds are dominantly massive with uncommon normal grading from massive, medium-grained beds to planar-laminated, very fine-grained beds in thick metasandstone packages. Metasandstone beds are interbedded with thin-bedded to thick-bedded, massive or cleaved metasiltstone and shale (Phillips et al., 2016). Contacts are sharp and mostly non-erosive.  Dow et al. (1964) noted that the uppermost Olympio Formation north of the Ord River was dominated by finer grained lithofacies, including packages of thin-bedded, laminated shale over 90 m thick, interbedded with rare silty metasandstone and conglomerate. They described massive or rare normally graded, coarse-grained greywacke grading into pebble conglomerate in beds up to 6 m thick interbedded with thin shale beds. The uppermost Olympio Formation west of Palm Spring (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 378131E 7962869N) consists of medium-bedded to very thick-bedded metasandstone with interbedded metasiltstone and metamudstone. Metasiltstone intraclasts up to 10 cm long mark amalgamation surfaces (Phillips et al., 2016). Small coarse-grained scours are seen at the base of thick-bedded, coarse-grained feldspathic metasandstone.  Conglomeratic and coarse-grained lithofacies are rare on HALLS CREEK and RUBY PLAINS, but a small number of outcrops about 12 km southwest of Ruby Plains Homestead (RUBY PLAINS, Zone 52, MGA 356622E 7943485N) have been noted. At these locations, metasandstone units consist of medium-bedded to very thick-bedded, coarse-grained and very coarse-grained subarkose or arkose. Normal grading is common. Quartz grains are subangular to subrounded and feldspar grains are angular to subangular. Lags consist of matrix-supported, monomictic, quartz-granule conglomerate, consisting of subangular to subrounded quartz grains in a matrix of massive, fine-grained subarkose. Dow et al. (1964) noted that pebble conglomerate is common towards the middle of the Olympio Formation south of the Ord River. The conglomerates are poorly sorted with rounded to subrounded cobbles of quartz, jasper, chert, fine-grained dolerite, feldspar, and shale in a matrix of meta-arkose or silty metasandstone (Dow et al., 1964).  The metasandstone and metasiltstone beds have reached greenschist (muscovite) facies with locally higher grades to greenschist (biotite) facies.  The c. 1856 Ma Maude Headley Member consists of metamorphosed alkali volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, carbonate, and siliciclastic metasedimentary rocks. The member lies 50 to 100 m stratigraphically above the base of the Olympio Formation. The c. 1846 Ma Butchers Gully Member similarly consists of metamorphosed andesitic to trachytic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks with a carbonate-rich matrix. Metachert and ferruginous metachert dominate some beds while metatrachytic lava flows, domes, and sills are common in others (Griffin and Tyler, 1993; Taylor et al., 1995a,b).","The metasedimentary lithofacies, which dominate the exposures of Olympio Formation, were probably deposited in a deep-marine setting. The volumetric majority of them derive from turbidity currents on a broad continental shelf or slope setting off the western margin of the North Australian Craton from >1856 Ma to c. 1834 Ma (Harms, 1959; Dow et al., 1964; Page and Hancock, 1988; Blake et al., 1999a; Phillips et al., 2016). Thick-bedded, fine-grained and medium-grained metasandstone with moderate to good sorting suggests middle to lower fan settings (Pickering et al., 1989; Phillips et al., 2011). Turbidite metasandstone beds have a sheet-like geometry. No large-scale facies architectural elements are seen (i.e. canyons, channels, levees). This sheet-like geometry, along with the abundance of massive beds and uncommon normal grading, indicates that the turbidity currents were depositing material in an unconfined basin, probably in an intra-lobe setting (Pickering et al., 1989; Phillips et al., 2011). Conglomeratic lags and coarse-grained meta-arkose probably indicate proximity to intralobe channels or deposition from high-volume, high-current energy turbidity currents delivering coarser material to the lobes. Planar laminated and massive metasiltstone packages were possibly deposited from wanning turbidity currents (Bouma division T E ) or from suspension settling and represent hemipelagic sedimentation (Bouma division T F ; Bouma, 1962).  The Maude Headley and Butchers Gully Members consist of lavas, volcaniclastic rocks, breccias (made of carbonate, siliciclatic and volcaniclastic clasts), and intercalated metasedimentary turbidite units. These members represent submarine volcanism at interpreted intraplate volcanic centres (Taylor et al., 1995a,b).",,4000,,"Due to the great areal extent of the Olympio Formation, the formation has numerous contact relationships with older, coeval, and younger units. The Olympio Formation is disconformably to unconformably overlying the Biscay Formation (Halls Creek Group). The contact is commonly sharp or locally erosive, representing a transgressive surface of erosion. The contact between the Biscay and Olympio Formations is locally faulted. North-northeasterly trending Halls Creek Fault juxtaposes the Biscay Formation against the younger Olympio Formation on southern HALLS CREEK and northern RUBY PLAINS (Blake et al., 1997; 1999b). North-northeasterly trending faults on southeast MCINTOSH also place upfaulted Biscay Formation against the Olympio Formation (Warren, 1997; Tyler et al., 1997).  The Olympio Formation is in fault contact with the Sophie Downs Suite (basement to the Eastern Zone of the Lamboo Province). Contacts with these basement rocks are restricted to the Taylor Lookout area (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 321759E 7909295N) and the Castle Creek Anticline on northeast HALLS CREEK and northwest ANTRIM. Less than 3 km south of Taylor Lookout, the east-west striking Haughton Range Fault places the Junda Microgranite in fault contact with the Olympio Formation (Tyler et al., 1998). On HALLS CREEK and ANTRIM, the northeast to north-northeasterly trending Gentle Annie Fault cuts the Castle Creek Anticline along its fold axis. On the western limb of the anticline, the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics are unconformably overlain by the lower Halls Creek Group (Saunders Creek Formation and Brim Rockhole Formation). On the eastern side of the Gentle Annie Fault the Olympio Formation is in fault contact with the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics and the Saunders Creek and Brim Rockhole Formations.  The Angelo and Halls Creek Faults are major structures, which place the Eastern and Central Zones of the Lamboo Province adjacent to one another. These faults place the Olympio Formation next to the Angelo Microgranite, Koongie Park Formation, and Tickalara Metamorphics (all Central Zone rocks). The Halls Creek Fault also places the Olympio Formation adjacent to the Red Rock Formation, which is a probable age equivalent of the Kimberley Basin. A series of northeast-trending faults between the Angelo and Halls Creek Faults place the Olympio Formation adjacent to the Moola Bulla Formation, which is a probable age equivalent of the Speewah Group.  The Olympio Formation is intruded by the c. 1835 Ma Woodward Dolerite and by younger granites. The 1808 Â± 3 Ma Mount Christine Granite intrudes the Olympio Formation on southern and western DOCKRELL from Mount Carmel (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 293126E 7910693N) northeast to Mount Christine (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 301443E 7929327N) and further northeast to Toongarra Hole (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 314313E 7939974N). The Olympio Formation is intruded by the 1804 Â± 5 Ma Eastman Granite and 1788 Â± 6 Ma San Sou Monzogranite in the Taylor Lookout area (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 321759E 7909295N; Page et al., 2001).  The eastern extent of the Olympio Formation is marked by a series of major unconformities. South of the Osmand Range (OSMAND, Zone 52, MGA 458013E 8107005N), the Paleo-Mesoproterozoic Mount Parker Formation unconformably overlies the Olympio Formation. Neoproterozoic rocks are in fault contact or unconformably overlie the Olympio Formation along the entire Albert Edward Range (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 396000E 7987009N). These Neoproterozoic units include all units of the Ruby Plains Group, most of the Duerdin Group (including the Fargoo Tillite, Frank River Sandstone, Moonlight Valley Tillite, and Ranford Formation), and half the units in the Albert Edward Group (Mount Forster Sandstone, Elvire Formation, Boonall Dolomite, and Timperley Shale). The Cambrain Antrim Plateau Volcanics is also unconformable to locally in fault contact with the Olympio Formation in the Albert Edward Range.",,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,1856,6,1808,,"A maximum age for the Olympio Formation is provided by a porphyritic felsic metavolcanic rock from the Maude Headley Member near the base of the formation. This rock was sampled for SHRIMP U-Pb zircon geochronology and yielded a date of 1856 Â± 6 Ma, which is interpreted as the age of volcanism in the lower Olympio Formation (GA 85598001, Blake et al., 1999a; Phillips et al., 2016). Two metasandstone samples from below the Maude Headley Member have provided weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* maximum depositional ages of 1861 Â± 3 Ma (GSWA 206126, Wingate et al., 2015b) and 1874 Â± 3 Ma (GA 93525128B, Phillips et al., 2016).  An amygdaloidal trachytic pillow lava from the Butchers Gully Member higher in the succession has a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1846 Â± 4 Ma, which is interpreted as the age of volcanism (GA 92524993C, Phillips et al., 2016). A sample of turbiditic metasandstone from the Olympio Formation, stratigraphically above the Butchers Gully Member, yielded a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* maximum depositional age of 1848 Â± 5 Ma (GA 92524896, Phillips et al., 2016).

They are dominantly gabbro with minor metaperidotite gabbronorite, leucogabbro, and dolerite. These sills have strike lengths of up to 40 km in the central part of the Abbotts greenstone belt and intrude into altered andesitic rocks of the Greensleeeves Formation (A-POg-f).","The Opal Gabbro is presently defined as some of the easternmost sills in the belt with strike lengths of up to 38 km and widths up to one kilometre. These are found on TIERACO and MEEKATHARRA. However, the extent and number of mafic-ultramafic bodies in the Abbotts greenstone belt is difficult to determine as the exposure to the east is limited. Aeromagnetic images show evidence of numerous highly magnetic rock packages to the east of the exposed rocks, and may indicate other intrusions, or multiple sills of the same intrusive event.","The gabbro is named after Mount Opal (Zone 50, MGA 632461E 7060502N) on MEEKATHARRA.",,"Lithologically, the gabbro is finer grained and less leucocratic closer to its western contact. Thin layers of gabbronorite within the gabbro contain phenocrysts of altered orthopyroxene up to 15 mm long. The orthopyroxene is weathered brown and constitutes up to 30% of the rock. Gabbro commonly grades into dolerite with a grain size of approximately 1 mm. Dolerite is locally in sharp contact with ultramafic rock, which is up to 50 m wide and has a very high magnetic susceptibility and comprises a fine- to medium-grained peridotite with well-preserved (typically ortho- and meso-) cumulate textures. It consists principally of olivine (typically altered to serpentine and talc), pyroxene (commonly altered), and magnetite.

It remains an informal unit due to ongoing uncertainties about its exact stratigraphic position. If it represents a western shoreline to the Ordovician of the Amadeus Basin it likely correlates somewhere within the middle of the Larapinta Group. An alternative, although less likely possibility is that it represents an eastern shoreline to the Ordovician of the Canning Basin.

These small intrusions are lithologically similar to the main pluton, although they have a lower radiometric response on composite K/Th/U spectrometric images, and a different response on LANDSAT TM images.",The Paperbark Granite is named after Paperbark Bore north of the Springvale Homestead on McINTOSH.,,"Coarse-grained rapakivi and porphyritic biotite monzogranite are the main rock types, but medium-grained, porphyritic granodiorite and monzogranite commonly form a zone up to several hundred metres wide along the margin of the intrusion. In general these finer grained, more mafic marginal phases are intruded by the coarse-grained porphyritic monzogranite. In the plugs northwest of the main pluton, the main rock types are a coarse-grained rapakivi granite and a medium-grained, weakly porphyritic biotite monzogranite. The finer grained monzogranite has intruded the rapakivi phase. Most of the rocks are only weakly deformed, but strong shearing is locally present along the eastern and northwestern margins of the intrusion.  Coarse-grained rapakivi granite consists of up to 50% round microperthite phenocrysts 2-4 cm in diameter, in a medium- to coarse-grained groundmass of quartz, plagioclase, microperthite and biotite. The microperthite phenocrysts commonly have a rim of sodic plagioclase several millimetres wide. Microperthite phenocrysts contain abundant inclusions of quartz, plagioclase and biotite. Accessory minerals are magnetite, apatite, zircon, allanite and monazite.  Porphyritic biotite monzogranite contains 20-35% round and tabular microcline phenocrysts generally <2 cm in diameter. Plagioclase is oligoclase in composition, and shows weak normal zoning; rare crystals contain more calcic, mottled and oscillatory zoned cores. Biotite is the sole mafic mineral comprising about 5% of the rocks. Accessory minerals consist of magnetite, apatite, zircon, allanite and monazite.  Marginal phases of weakly to moderately porphyritic granodiorite and monzogranite contain about 10-20% round phenocrysts of microperthite up to 1.5 cm in diameter, in a fine- to medium-grained groundmass. The groundmass is composed of quartz, plagioclase and microcline, together with 5-10% biotite and 10-15% blue-green ferrohastingsite.

227,31788,P_-PB-xg-o,1,Paperbark Supersuite,1,"Granite, microgranite, gabbro, layered maficâ€“ultramafic intrusions, and felsic volcanic rock","The Paperbark Supersuite comprises granite, porphyritic microgranite (&quot;high-level porphyry intrusions&quot; of Griffin et al., 2000), felsic volcanic rock (Whitewater Volcanics), gabbro, and mafic-ultramafic intrusions (Springvale Suite) all with crystallization ages between 1864 Â± 4 Ma and 1852 Â± 4 Ma. The supersuite previously did not include the Whitewater Volcanics or the Springvale Suite, but the supersuite is here redefined to include these units because:  (1) local gradational contacts between porphyritic microgranite and felsic volcanic rocks of the Whitewater Volcanics (e.g. Gellatly et al., 1974, 1975; Griffin et al., 1993) suggest that the two are closely related,  (2) several porphyritic microgranite units strongly resemble massive, thickly bedded, crystal-rich ignimbrites of the Whitewater Volcanics (Gellatly et al., 1974; Griffin et al., 1993; Sheppard et al., 1997), and  (3) many of the mafic-ultramafic intrusions of the Springvale Suite have contacts with the granites marked by net-vein complexes and other textures and structures indicative of mingling and limited mixing, as do the unlayered gabbros already included within the supersuite (Blake and Hoatson, 1993; Sheppard, 1996).  All of the units included within the expanded Paperbark Supersuite have close temporal, spatial and genetic associations. The supersuite includes the Toby Gabbro (Group III intrusion of Hoatson, 2000). Differentiation of granites is accomplished more by field relationships as many of the ages for the Paperbark Supersuite overlap.","The Paperbark Supersuite outcrops throughout the Western Zone of the Lamboo Province over a distance of about 700 km, in both the east and west Kimberley. The supersuite does not occur in the Central or Eastern Zones of the Lamboo Province. Unlayered gabbro and mafic-ultramafic intrusions of the Springvale Suite are abundant only in the northern half of the Western Zone in the east Kimberley; farther south and in the west Kimberley, mafic and ultramafic rocks are rare.  Coarse-grained granite and unlayered gabbro constitute about half of the exposed Western Zone of the Lamboo Province. The granites are usually distinguished from the porphyritic microgranite intrusions by the coarser grained groundmass in the former, but there may be gradations between the two: for example, the Crooked Creek Granite and the Castlereagh Hill Porphyry (Thorne et al., 1999).  The porphyritic microgranites are commonly closely associated with the Whitewater Volcanics. Most of the units, namely the Mondooma Granite, Mount Disaster Porphyry, Bickleys Porphyry, Tarraji Micromonzogranite, Richenda Microgranodiorite, Little Gold River Microgranodiorite and Square Top Microgranite outcrop in the west Kimberley. Two porphyritic microgranite intrusions, the Greenvale Porphyry and Castlereagh Hill Porphyry, outcrop in the northern part of the Western Zone of the Lamboo Complex in the east Kimberley. The Whitewater Volcanics form a 600 km-long discontinuous belt of felsic volcanic rock, and high-level porphyritic microgranite sills, along the edge of the Western Zone of the Lamboo Province.","The Paperbark Supersuite was probably named after the outcrops around Paperbark Bore (Lat. -17&deg; 44' 25'' S, Long. 127&deg; 41' 25'' E; McINTOSH 1:100 000 map sheet) on a tributary of the Upper Panton River, west of the McIntosh Hills, and 26 km due west of Alice Downs Homestead. The Paperbark Bore is accessible via a track from the Great Northern Highway.",,"The Paperbark Supersuite is composed of similarly aged felsic volcanics (the Whitewater Volcanics), high-level porphyry intrusions (e.g. the Mount Disaster Porphyry, Richenda Microgranodiorite, Mondooma Granite, Greenvale Porphyry, Castlereagh Hill Porphyry etc.), granites (e.g. the Lennard Granite, Kongorow Granite etc.), and minor gabbroic rocks (e.g. the Toby Gabbro). The most voluminous lithologies of the supersuite are monzogranite and granodiorite (and their metamorphosed equivalents), syenogranite, tonalite and metatonalite, and gabbro. Minor lithologies include rhyolitic, andesitic, and dacitic lavas and volcaniclastics. Geochemical studies on the granites of the Paperbark Supersuite have revealed high K 2 O, Rb, Y, Th, and K 2 O/Na 2 O contents and low Sr, Sr/Y, and K/Rb values (Sheppard et al., 1995; Wyborn, 1988; Hoatson and Blake, 2000). Consequently they resemble other Paleproterozoic granites from northern Australia (Griffin et al., 2000).  Granitic plutons:  The granites of the Paperbark Supersuite are high-K I-type granites (Chappell and White, 1974), medium- or coarse-grained, commonly porphyritic, with some even-grained phases. Monzogranites dominate with granodiorite, syenogranite, and lesser tonalite. Tabular and rounded phenocrysts of microperthite microcline up to 6 cm across are common with other phenocrysts including plagioclase and quartz (particularly in the granodiorites and tonalites; Griffin et al., 2000). The groundmass of the Paperbark granites is generally composed of microcline and quartz with subhedral plagioclase and biotite. The dominant ferromagnesian mineral is biotite (Sheppard et al., 1995) forming aggregates up to 5 mm long. Hornblende and orthopyroxene may be present in intrusions with a more intermediate composition (Griffin et al., 2000). Small patches, or enclaves, of mafic material can be found within the Paperbark granites. The following description of the mafic enclaves is taken from Griffin et al. (2000). &ldquo;Small, rounded, fine-grained mafic enclaves are common in tonalite and granodiorite, and in some silicic intrusions. The enclaves may be either even-textured, or contain K-feldspar megacrysts similar to phenocrysts in the host granite. The enclaves have the same mineralogy and textures as gabbro intrusions thought to be coeval with the granites. Some intrusions dominated by tonalite and granodiorite also contain widespread mafic clots up to 3 cm in diameter. They have a decussate texture and are composed of either plagioclase and biotite, or plagioclase and hornblende in hornblende-bearing host granites. Associated with these clots are scattered quartz oikocrysts with inclusions of plagioclase, biotite, and acicular apatite&rdquo;.  High-level porphyry intrusions:  The high-level porphyritic intrusions in the Paperbark Supersuite are probably sheet-like or form stocks (e.g. the Mount Disaster Porphyry). The porphyries are not zoned. Porphyries are composed of up to 65% phenocrysts of tabular/rounded K-feldspar up to 4 cm long (some rimmed by plagioclase), subhedral plagioclase, and bipyramidal quartz. The groundmass is very fine- or fine-grained with a similar composition. Minor minerals in the groundmass include sericite, clinozoisite, epidote, biotite, chlorite, and accessory zircon, sphene, iron oxide, apatite, and calcite. The main ferromagnesian mineral is biotite, commonly altered to chlorite.  Felsic volcanics: The felsic volcanic component of the Paperbark Supersuite is represented by the Whitewater Volcanics. This formation consists of rhyolitic to dacitic lavas, a variety of pyroclastic and volcaniclastic rocks of similar composition, and minor metasedimentary rocks. Lavas are coherent and massive or with minor flow banding. The following description of the lavas in taken from Griffin et al. (2000). They [the lavas] &ldquo;contain phenocrysts of euhedral to subhedral plagioclase and sanidine, embayed and bipyramidal quartz, and recrystallized biotite. Least-altered samples of andesitic to dacitic composition contain phenocrysts of hypersthene, and rare chloritized hornblende. The groundmass consists of very fine grained granular untwinned feldspar, quartz, sericite and chlorite&rdquo;. Ignimbrites and tuffaceous rocks are common in the Whitewater Volcanics and are rich in volcanic lithic fragments such as pumice and glass shards. Ignimbrites are columnar jointed.   Gabbroic plutons:  The following section on the gabbroic rocks of the Paperbark Supersuite is taken from Griffin et al. (2000): &ldquo;Coeval gabbro intrusions are composed of massive and fine- to medium-grained, biotite-bearing norite, gabbronorite, gabbro and diorite. Biotite comprises about 5-10% of the rocks, and forms megacrysts and crystals in the groundmass. Quartz is typically interstitial to the pyroxenes and plagioclase (Sheppard et al., 1997). Many of the intrusions contain veins and irregular patches of xenocrystic hybrid rock, granite and quartz diorite. The gabbros also grade into intrusions of hybrid rock composed of biotite-bearing norite through quartz diorite to rare tonalite. These intrusions are heterogeneous, and are characterised by rounded xenocrysts of quartz and plagioclase. Plagioclase xenocrysts have sieved margins and fine rims of microcline. Both plagioclase and quartz are enclosed by fine-grained orthopyroxene and biotite&rdquo;. Evidence for felsic and mafic magma mingling include net-vein complexes (Blake and Hoatson, 1993; Sheppard, 1996; Griffin et al., 2000).","The felsic volcanics and granites of the c. 1864-1852 Ma Paperbark Supersuite are restricted to the western zone of the Lamboo Province (Tyler et al., 1995). The Paperbark Supersuite was probably emplaced during post-collisional tectonics between the Kimberley Craton unknown Paleoproterozoic terranes as a result of northwest-directed subduction under the Kimberley Craton. This accretionary event did not involve the North Australian Craton as rocks in the eastern zone of the Lamboo Province (e.g. Halls Creek Group) were not deformed until c. 1845-1820 Ma (Sheppard et al., 1997). All three terranes of the Lamboo Province did not come together until the Halls Creek Orogeny (c. 1820 Ma); 30 million years after the emplacement of the Paperbark Supersuite (Griffin et al., 2000). The granites of the supersuite have geochemical similarities with high-K, post-collisional granites (Sheppard et al., 1997).",,,,,,17,,,Mixed,8,,,,1867,6,1849,6,"SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages from the various intrusions of the Paperbark Supersuite have been used to define its age limits. The oldest date obtained is from the extensively outcropping Lennard Granite. The oldest igneous crystallisation age obtained from this granite is 1867 Â± 6 Ma (Lu et al., 2017a), with other ages ranging between 1866 and 1862 Ma (Griffin et al., 2000; Lu et al., 2017b). The Lennard Granite is not the oldest granite in the supersuite as it intrudes other (undated) units (e.g. the Mount Disaster Porphyry). The youngest age reported for a granitic rock of the Paperbark Supersuite is an 1852 Â± 4 Ma date obtained from the Kongorow Granite (Griffin et al., 2000). The Whitewater Volcanics are considered extrusive equivalents of some of the Paperbark granites (e.g. the Mount Disaster Porphyry and Mondooma Granite) and are comagmatic with the supersuite, with ages overlapping the younger range of dates obtained from granitic rocks. Felsic volcanic rocks from the Whitewater Volcanics have yielded igneous crystallisation ages of 1857 Â± 4, 1854 Â± 5 (Griffin et al., 2000), 1854 Â± 6 (Lu et al., 2016) and 1849 Â± 6 Ma (Worden et al., 2008).",No,,,20,,No,DE in Progress,Yes,Yes,P_,PB,,40,12,,MIGMBCP,2.02E+13,,No,No

4134,29988,A-HAdp-kd,2257,Paraburdoo Member,1,"Grey, crystalline dolomite; minor chert","The Paraburdoo Member is the middle member of the Wittenoom Formation and consists predominantly of planar-bedded crystalline dolomite with minor interbedded argillite and chert. It is thickest and best exposed in the Fortescue Valley and is present in drillholes WRL 1 and FVG 1, where it is extensively brecciated and contains horizontal and vertical stylolites. However, neither drillhole penetrates the full thickness of the unit, so it is difficult to estimate a maximum thickness. The Paraburdoo Member gradationally overlies the West Angela Member and is gradationally overlain by the Bee Gorge Member. In the absence of any shallow-water depositional features, the Paraburdoo Member is interpreted to have been deposited below storm wave base, most likely in a hemipelagic environment between c. 2590 and 2570 Ma.","The Paraburdoo Member is present throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region on the 1:250 000 map sheets YARRALOOLA, PYRAMID, WYLOO, MOUNT BRUCE, ROY HILL, BALFOUR DOWNS, TUREE CREEK, NEWMAN, and ROBERTSON, although it is generally not well exposed. The Paraburdoo Member is commonly recessively weathered and occupies many of the larger valleys in the region, reaching its maximum thickness in the Fortescue Valley, where drill hole WRL1 intersected a minimum thickness of 420 m. Overall, the member thins from north to south, but generally its thickness is in the order of a couple of hundred metres. In the type section it is 260 m thick. Thickness variations are likely to have been affected by structural repetition and localized carbonate dissolution (Morris, 1985; Simonson et al., 1993a; Taylor et al., 2001).","Although the formal definition does not state the origin of the name, it is presumed to be named after the town of Paraburdoo (Zone 50, MGA 568725E 7434173N) in the central part of the southern Pilbara region. The type section of the Paraburdoo Member is a composite section measured in the hills to the southwest of the town and was constructed using local marker beds (Simonson et al., 1993b). The type area is in the vicinity of the type section, but other good areas of exposure include the upper reaches of Weeli Wolli Creek (Zone 50, MGA 720386E 7448776N), along Jimmawurrada Creek (Zone 50, MGA 451419E 7583539N) and along the northern edge of the Wyloo Anticline (Zone 50, MGA 440078E 7504288N). Several diamond drillcores through all or part of the member are available in the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) Core Library at Carlisle, in particular WRL 1, FVG 1, ECD 1, and RHD 296.",,"The Paraburdoo Member consists predominantly of tabular, evenly bedded dolomite with lesser amounts of chert and argillite. Thickness of bedding within the dolomite ranges from a few centimetres to decimetres, whereas argillite beds are thinner and appear as partings that separate dolomite beds. The dolomites are commonly brecciated and also display both horizontal and vertical stylolites. Simonson et al. (1993a) and Simonson and Carney (1999) describe lumpy laminations and roll-up structures that are interpreted to be the product of sediment stabilization by microbial mats. Chert is confined to specific horizons, and commonly forms grey to black nodules that locally display evidence of soft-sediment deformation.","The absence of stromatolites or any other indicators of shallow-water deposition, combined with the association of planar-laminated argillite and black chert suggest that the Paraburdoo Member was deposited below storm wave base, most likely in a hemipelagic environment. Facies and thickness changes, combined with paleocurrent data and regional correlation of stratigraphic markers indicate that the Paraburdoo Member was deposited basinward of a shallow-water carbonate platform, represented in part by the Carawine Dolomite (Simonson et al., 1993a; Rasmussen et al., 2005; Hurst et al., 2013).",,,,"The Paraburdoo Member conformably overlies the West Angela Member and is in turn conformably overlain by the Bee Gorge Member.

The pelitic gneiss is migmatized and consists of diatexite as schollen migmatite with a mesosome of dark, biotite-rich restite. The diatexite leucosomes contain an assemblage of cordierite-sillimanite-hercynitic-spinel-biotite-quartz-corundum and the mesosome/restite contains garnet-sillimanite-gahnitic-spinel-plagioclase-biotite-quartz, assemblages indicative of high-temperature, moderate- to high-pressure metamorphism. Results from U-Pb SHRIMP zircon geochronology indicate that the pelitic protolith was deposited sometime after c. 2080 Ma and metamorphosed at high grade during the D 1g  event of the Glenburgh Orogeny at c. 2000 Ma, coincident with the intrusion of voluminous intermediate to felsic arc-related rocks.","Migmatitic pelitic gneiss forms rare, 5-10 m wide, discontinuous strips up to 100 m long, intercalated with intermediate to felsic gneisses of the Dalgaringa Supersuite in the Paradise Zone around Paradise Well on  GLENBURGH.

An example of diatexite that has been dated using U-Pb SHRIMP zircon geochronology is located at SPJGLE000002 (Zone 50, MGA 413802E 7191863N). The pelitic gneiss is migmatized and consists of diatexite as schollen migmatite with a mesosome of dark, biotite-rich restite. It is a coarse-grained granoblastic rock with mm- to cm-scale, discontinuous, leucocratic melt segregations that parallel the regional S 1g  gneissic fabrics. The diatexite leucosomes contain an assemblage of cordierite-sillimanite-hercynitic-spinel-biotite-quartz-corundum. The cordierite forms 1-5 mm diameter porphyroblasts, in which the core regions are intergrown with abundant fibrolite mats. The outer 0.25-1 mm part of the porphyroblasts are free of sillimanite, but are partially mantled by coarse-grained (0.5-2 mm diameter), euhedral sillimanite blades. The cores of these sillimanite blades are replaced with hercynitic spinel, which in turn are locally pseudomorphed by corundum. Tabular biotite blades are intergrown within the cordierite-sillimanite coronas and appear to be in textural equilibrium with these phases; however, in the matrix, which comprises quartz-cordierite-biotite, the biotite blades are not in textural equilibrium, but are mantled by fringes of fibrolite and cordierite. The mesosome/restite contains an assemblage of garnet-sillimanite-gahnitic-spinel-plagioclase-biotite-quartz. Garnet is observed within 10-20 mm thick biotite-rich seams and forms 5-10 mm diameter porphyroblasts that contain inclusions of both biotite and sillimanite. Outside of these seams, quartz and plagioclase are more prevalent. Tabular biotite blades are mantled by fringes of fibrolite and cordierite, and the biotite exsolves small pockets of ilmenite. Discontinuous sillimanite-rich seams up to 10-15 mm wide are composed of euhedral sillimanite blades with minor biotite-quartz-plagioclase. The sillimanite cores are replaced by anhedral gahnitic spinel. The presence of almandine-garnet-corundum-spinel is interpreted to indicate metamorphism under high-temperature, moderate- to high-pressure conditions (Schulters and Bohlen, 1988).",,,,,"The diatexite only forms thin, discontinuous strips, trains, and inclusions within intermediate- to felsic-gneisses of the Dalgaringa Supersuite (P_-DA-xmgg-mwo). As the contacts are not exposed, direct relationship between these rocks and the surrounding gneiss is not known, but presumably the granitic precursors to the gneisses were intruded into the pelitic unit before deformation. Some of the boundaries could be tectonic in origin.",,17,,,,4,,,,2083,7,1997,10,"A sample of pelitic diatexite (GSWA 185942) was collected for U-Pb SHRIMP zircon geochronology from the largest outcrop of diatexite, about 0.5 km west-northwest of Paradise Well. The sample yielded abundant subhedral to euhedral zircons, the majority of which consisted of zoned, low-U detrital cores overgrown by high-U, low-Th/U metamorphic rims. Eighty-two analyses were obtained from 76 zircons, of which nine were obtained from high-U rims. Most analyses of zircon cores were concordant, and yielded  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* dates of 3222-2083 Ma, including several age components. The two youngest analyses of detrital cores yielded a concordia age of 2083 Â± 7 Ma, interpreted as a maximum age of deposition of the pelitic protolith. Seven analyses of zircon rims yielded a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1997 Â± 10 Ma (MSWD = 3.3), interpreted as the age of high-grade metamorphism and migmatization.  Granites from the P_-DA-xmgg-mwo unit have not been dated directly but belong to a suite of intermediate and felsic rocks that are part of the Dalgaringa Supersuite, the older parts of which have been precisely dated between c. 2005 and c. 1985 Ma (Occhipinti et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 2010, 2011), consistent with the geochronology of this sample. These ages suggest that metamorphism and migmatization in the pelitic strips occurred during the D 1g  event of the Glenburgh Orogeny and was directly related to intrusion of the voluminous arc-related granites of the Dalgaringa Supersuite (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011).",No,,,747,,No,DE in Progress,No,No,P_,_pw,,13,24,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.01E+13,No,No

376,15043,P_-KMp-st,4719,Pentecost Sandstone,1,"Quartz sandstone, pebbly sandstone, siltstone and mudstone","The Pentecost Sandstone is an extensively outcropping, thick, sandstone-dominated package. It is a highland-forming unit, highly resistant to weathering and makes up many of the ranges in the east and central Kimberley region. Throughout most the Kimberley region the c. 1800 Ma Pentecost Sandstone is the uppermost formation within the Kimberley Group. In the coastal west Kimberley region the formation is conformably overlain by the Yampi Formation (which is correlative with the Upper Member of the Pentecost Sandstone in the east Kimberley Basin; Tyler and Griffin, 1993). The Pentecost Sandstone is intruded by the mafic sills of the Hart Dolerite to far lesser degree compared with the lower Kimberley Group. The formation is unconformably overlain by younger Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic sedimentary basin sediments.  The Pentecost Sandstone has an informal tripartite division into a Lower Member, Middle Member, and Upper Member. The formation is entirely sedimentary siliciclastic with white, cross-bedded, quartz-dominated sandstones being the most abundant lithofacies. Feldspathic sandstones, siltstone, shale, and pebbly sandstones are also present. The Lower Member is mainly medium- to coarse-grained quartz sandstones. The Middle Member contains cupriferous and ferruginous sandstone, siltstone, and shale. The Upper Member records a coarsening of sediment towards the top of the formation with deposition of coarse-grained sandstone and pebbly sandstone.  The Pentecost Sandstone was probably deposited in a marginal marine setting with some tidal influence. Desiccation cracks and mineralized siltstones and sandstones in the Middle Member suggest periods of subaerial exposure with concomitant reducing (possibly anaerobic) conditions within the sediment. An intertidal setting is inferred. The mature, coarse-grained, cross-bedded sandstones of the Pentecost Sandstone were probably deposited in a nearshore or lower shoreface setting with strong current energies.","The Pentecost Sandstone is a prominent ridge-, cliff-, and highland-forming package of well-induriated sandstone that is well-exposed in the east Kimberley region. The Pentecost Sandstone is missing in the majority of the west Kimberley region due to significant erosion of the upper Kimberley Group, however, there are a few small outcrops along the coastal western region around the Doubtful, Collier, and Talbot Bays, the Montgomery Islands, and the Kimbolton Range.  In the central and south Kimberley region, the formation is exposed in a few broad highland areas including the Barnett Range, the Baulk Face Range, and the highlands in and around the Mueller Range. The Pentecost Sandstone outcrops in the Precipice Range at the southern end of the northwest-trending King Leopold Ranges but is not exposed in the King Leopold Ranges.  The volumetric majority of the preserved Pentecost Sandstone is exposed in the east Kimberley where it dominates the outcrops of the region. It makes the Seppelt Range in the north, is the dominant formation under the Drysdale River National Park, makes the Milligan and Pentecost Ranges, and makes nearly all of the Bluff Face Range which covers much of the highland area in the southeast Kimberley region.  The entire formation covers and area approximately 36,452 km 2 .","The Pentecost Sandstone is probably named after from the exposures around the Pentecost River (Lat. -15&deg; 55' 29'' S, Long. 127&deg; 45' 27'' E) or in the Pentecost Range (Lat. -15&deg; 36' 59'' S, Long. 127&deg; 51' 14'' E), both approximately 50 km southwest of the town of Wyndham on the CAMBRIDGE GULF 1:250 000. The river and range themselves are named after John Pentecost who surveyed the river in 1882.",,"The Pentecost Sandstone outcrops as thick- or medium-bedded, coarse- to fine-grained, well-sorted, cross-bedded, cross-laminated and planar parallel laminated, recrystallised quartz arenites (orthoquartzite). Red, massive siltstone intraclasts are seen as well as siltstone drapes on some cross-laminations (e.g. outcrops along the Gibb River Road, between the Gibb Range to the west and Mosquito Hills to the east: CXPASH000248 and CXPMTE000249). The Pentecost Sandstone is informally divided into upper, middle, and lower members.  The Lower Member is composed of white, cross-bedded, quartz-dominated sandstone (Derrick, 1968) with minor feldspathic sandstone (Plumb and Perry, 1971), clay pellets (Gellatly and Sofoulis, 1969), and shale-pellet conglomerate (Plumb and Perry, 1971).  The Middle Member has a basal unit made of grey, thin-bedded, glauconitic sandstone and minor feldspathic sandstone (Gellatly and Sofoulis. 1969). In the north Kimberley region on the ASHTON and MEDUSA BANKS 1:250 000 map sheets the Middle Member contains cupriferous siltstone, chloritic siltstone, and glauconitic siltstone with ferruginous-glauconitic feldspathic sandstone and micaceous shale (Plumb and Perry, 1971; Gellatly and Derrick, 1968). In the south Kimberley region (MOUNT RAMSAY 1:250 000 map sheet) the Middle Member contains fine- to coarse-grained quartz sandstones with numerous sedimentary structures including desiccation cracks and ripple marks (Roberts et al., 1968).  The Upper Member is made of a coarse-grained, trough and planar cross-bedded, quartz sandstone. This lithofacies is notable for marking an up section coarsening of the Pentecost Formation which is described throughout the Kimberley Basin. Further to this coarsening, the Upper Member contains granule sandstone units as well as interbedded pebbly sandstones (Derrick, 1968; Roberts et al., 1968; Thorne et al., 1999). Griffin et al. (1993) noted that the Upper Member was not preserved in the Pentecost Sandstone outcrops of the Precipice Range on LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 map sheet. In the west Kimberley region, on the YAMPI 1:250 000 map sheet, the Upper Member of the Pentecost Sandstone is correlative with the Yampi Formation (Tyler and Griffin, 1993).","The Pentecost Sandstone probably represents shallow marine or marginal marine deposition into the stable Kimberley Basin. The abundance of thick-bedded quartz arenite and minor feldspathic sandstones suggests a highly mature sediment source (probably of granitic provenance) and frequent reworking of the source material.  Strong bottoms currents are indicated by the ubiquitous trough and planar cross-bedding with some cross-beds overturned indicative of high current energies. Deposition of mud drapes and silty cross-laminations indicates there is a strong and frequent change in current energy to allow deposition of fine-grained material. A nearshore or shoreline setting is inferred for these sediments in the Pentecost Sandstone, with deposition taking place above fair weather wave base possibly under the influence of tidal processes (although no evidence for bidirectional currents has been found as yet).  Desiccation cracks in the Middle Member indicate a period(s) of subaerial exposure while the numerous mineralized lithofacies (glauconitic, cupriferous, and phosphatic siltstones and sandstones) are possibly indicative of changing redox conditions within the sediment profile. An intertidal setting is inferred for this informal member with mineralized siltstones indicating anaerobic and/or reducing conditions as a result of subaerial exposure.  The coarsening upwards of the Pentecost Formation into the Upper Member suggests shoreface or nearshore high current energy settings with the deposition of coarse-grained, cross-bedded quartz-sandstones. These sandstones are punctuated by higher current energy events evinced by intraclasts of ripped up siltstone (from presumably higher up the depositional profile, probably from the intertidal siltstones represented by the Middle Member) and pebbly sandstones and conglomerates.  Paleoflows recorded from the Pentecost Sandstone are consistent across the Kimberley region (Gellatly et al., 1970). They are dominantly from the north and northwest (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967; Gellatly and Sofoulis. 1969; Plumb and Perry, 1971) with less abundant paleoflow from the north and east in the north Kimberley region (on the ASHTON 1:250 000 map sheet; Derrick, 1968).",220,1300,,"For the most of the Kimberley region the Pentecost Sandstone is the conformable uppermost formation of the Kimberley Group. Only in the coastal westernmost Kimberley region around the Yampi Sound and Wotjalum Reserve where the Yampi Formation is exposed is the Pentecost Sandstone not at the top of the Kimberley Group. The Yampi Formation is conformable on the Middle Member of the Pentecost Sandstone in this area, being correlative with the Pentecost Sandstone Upper Member (Tyler and Griffin, 1993).  In the east and central Kimberley region, where the Pentecost Sandstone dominates much of the exposures, the formation rests conformably on the Elgee Siltstone. In the coastal west Kimberley region, however, the Pentecost Sandstone is found unconformably overlying the Warton Sandstone between the Walcott Inlet and Secure Bay.  The Pentecost Sandstone has only minor intrusions of the Hart Dolerite compared with the lower Kimberley Group and Speewah Group.  In the eastern Bluff Face Range in the Salmond River area (SALMOND, KARUNJIE, and ELGEE 1:100 000 map sheets) the Pentecost Sandstone in unconformably overlain younger Paleoproterozoic Bastion Group sediments. In the Harris Range/western Bluff Face Range area (border of BARNETT and SIDDINS 1:000 000 map sheets), starting approximately 20 km south of Gibb River (Ngallagunda) Homestead, the Pentecost Sandstone is unconformably overlain by the glacial sediments of the Neoproterozoic Mount House Group.",,17,,,,4,,,,1791,,1740,,"The Pentecost Sandstone has been dated using detrital zircon geochronology from three samples. A quartz sandstone from the lower Pentecost Sandstone yielded a maximum depositional age from a weighted mean 207Pb*/206Pb* date of 1796 Â± 16 Ma with significant age components at c. 2506, 1989, 1952, 1850 and 1774 Ma (GSWA 190639, Wingate et al., 2012). A quartz sandstone from the middle Pentecost Sandstone yielded a maximum depositional age from a weighted mean 207Pb*/206Pb* date of 1796 Â± 24 Ma with significant age components at c. 2525, 1969, 1868 and 1787 Ma (GSWA 182102, Kirkland et al., 2010a). A quartz sandstone from the upper Pentecost Sandstone yielded a maximum depositional age from a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1862 Â± 5 Ma with significant age components at c. 2512, 2497, 2482 and 1866 Ma (Kirkland et al., 2010b). The maximum depositional age and youngest age significant component from the top of the Pentecost Sandstone are older than the youngest magmatic zircons analysed from the Whitewater Volcanics that conformably underlay the Kimberley Basin. The Whitewater Volcanics, part of the Paperbark Supersuite in the Western Zone of the Lamboo Province, have yielded igneous crystallisation ages of 1857 Â± 4, 1854 Â± 5 (Griffin et al., 2000), 1854 Â± 6 (Lu et al., 2016) and 1849 Â± 6 Ma (Worden et al., 2008). A better constraint on the timing of sedimentation in the Pentecost Sandstone is the age of the Hart Dolerite. Sills of the Hart Dolerite extensively intruded the Speewah Group and lower Kimberley Group. Dolerite sills are contiguous with basalt lava in the Carson Volcanics and together constitute the Hart-Carson Large Igneous Province. Sheppard et al. (2012) reported U-Pb ages from a granophyric unit within the Hart Dolerite at 1799 Â± 17 Ma from zircon (GA 8759.8003) and 1795 Â± 15 Ma from baddeleyite (GSWA 113574). A minimum age of 1791 Â± 8 Ma was provided from sample GSWA 206156 by Wingate et al. (in prep). The minimum age of the Hart-Carson LIP at c. 1791 Ma is considered a reasonable maximum age of deposition of the upper Kimberley Group and Pentecost Sandstone.  A minimum depositional age for the Pentecost Sandstone (and the rest of the upper Kimberley Group) is provided by a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age from the Wotjulum Porphyry that intrudes the Elgee Siltstone, from the top of the Warton Sandstone to the base of the Pentecost Sandstone, in the Yampi Sound area. The Wotjulum Porphyry was dated at 1740 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 95406, Wingate et al., 2011; Sheppard et al., 2012). ",No,,,2,,No,DE in Progress,No,Yes,P_,KMp,,,,,MIMFERL,2.02E+13,,No,No

In WA the formation is exposed only at the Boord Ridges (MACDONALD 1:100 000 map sheet area; Haines and Allen, 2014) where it is about 300 m thick and was originally included in the now abandoned 'Boord Formation' by Wells et al. (1964). The age of the formation is early Ediacaran from stratigraphic position and palynological dating in the NT. It belongs to Supersequence 3 of the Centralian Superbasin (Supersequence terminology of Walter et al., 1995).  ","The Pertatataka Formation is widespread in the northeastern NT Amadeus Basin. In the south and west NT Amadeus Basin the equivalent interval is inferred to be within the Inindia beds (Haines et al., 2012; Haines and Allen, 2014; Edgoose, 2013). However, it has probably been eroded during the Petermann Orogeny in areas close to the southern margin of the basin. In WA the Pertatataka Formation is only recognised in outcrop in the Boord Ridges (MACDONALD 1:100 000 map sheet area) and around an unnamed syncline a few kilometres to the west, although it is suspected to be more widespread in the subsurface in northern part of the basin. In the southern half of the WA Amadeus Basin it has likely to have been eroded during the Petermann Orogeny. It is estimated to be about 300 m thick on the northern limb of the Boord Ridges syncline.","The name Pertatataka was first used as 'Pertatataka Series' by Madigan (1932), and was derived from an Aboriginal word meaning 'red rock'. The Pertatataka Formation was originally defined by Prichard and Quinlan (1962), but was substantially revised by Preiss et al. (1978) after the recognition of inconsistent usage in different parts of the basin. The type section is 5 km west of Ellery Creek in the Macdonnell Ranges, north-central Amadeus Basin in the NT (HERMANNSBURG 1:250 000 map sheet area).

Thin flaggy beds of poorly sorted, medium- to coarse-grained feldspathic and lithic sandstone are poorly exposed near the top of the unit.

In addition, because the unit forms fault-bounded slices, there is a lack of cross-cutting relationships with other datable lithologies. However, a single sample of quartz-rich calc-silicate gneiss (GSWA 142908; Nelson, 1999b) did yield abundant zircons that were subsequently dated by the U-Pb SHRIMP technique. The detrital zircons yielded a maximum depositional age of c. 2600 Ma. A more conservative estimate is provided by the youngest nine analyses, which indicate a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 2608 Â± 4 Ma.  One analysis of a thin metamorphic zircon rim (around an older detrial grain) yielded a moderate Th/U ratio of 0.3 and a  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1944 Â± 5 Ma (1&sigma;), interpreted as the age of high-grade metamorphism. However, a more reliable constraint on the age of metamorphism is 1955 Â± 7 Ma, obtained from 12 analyses of zircon rims in sample GSWA 142910 of the Quartpot Pelite (Nelson, 1999a), which shares the same structural and metamorphic history as the Petter Calc-silicate. This date also provides a younger limit for sedimentation, which occurred between c. 2610 and c. 1955 Ma. A statistical comparison of the detrital zircon age modes within the Petter Calc-silicate sample with those of representative granite samples along the northern Yilgarn Craton, including the Yarlarweelor Gneiss Complex, produces a good correlation (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011). This suggests that the Petter Calc-silicate sediment was sourced directly from the Yilgarn Craton. Considering the sole Archean detritus and Yilgarn Craton-like source for the Petter Calc-silicate, it is still possible that the sediment was deposited during the same interval as the Quartpot Pelite (2001-1955 Ma), albeit on a different cratonic margin.

(2002) is considered to be a high-level intrusive rock associated with the similarly aged Marda Complex and Butcher Bird Monzogranite, which lie immediately to the south on JOHNSTON RANGE and JACKSON (Morris et al., 2007; Morris and Kirkland, 2014). The geochemistry of the Pigeon Rocks Monzogranite suggests that it was also a significant source for clastic sedimentary rocks in the Diemals Formation, which occupies the Yarbu Syncline immediately to the west. The Pigeon Rocks Monzogranite has a contact-parallel foliation that is more pronounced near granite-greenstone contacts.

In the Mangaroon Zone, from the southern part of TOWERA to the northwestern edge of MOUNT AUGUSTUS, it outcrops over a length of more than 160 km with a maximum width of 30 km. Much of the unit may comprise a single intrusion. The most abundant rock type is a coarse-grained, porphyritic to megacrystic biotite(-muscovite) monzo- to syenogranite that contains tabular megacrysts (up to 7 cm long) of K-feldspar. Three specimens from the unit sampled for SHRIMP U-Pb zircon geochronology yielded an igneous crystallization age of c. 1675 Ma.","The Pimbyana Granite (P_-DUpi-gmw, P_-DUpi-gt, P_-DUpi-gmi) (Pearson et al., 1996; Martin et al., 2002) is the largest granite unit in the Mangaroon Zone in the northern part of the Gascoyne Province. The bulk of the unit outcrops on MANGAROON and EDMUND, where it is mainly restricted to north of the Mangaroon Syncline and its extension to the southeast. It also outcrops as a minor unit on northern LYNDON and southern TOWERA on the western side of the Mangaroon Syncline. Farther along strike to the southeast, the Pimbyana Granite forms a series of inliers and isolated exposures over an area >60 km 2  amongst units of the Edmund Group and regolith on northeastern MOUNT PHILLIPS and adjacent northwestern MOUNT AUGUSTUS. The unit outcrops over a length of about 160 km. The Pimbyana Granite also forms an intrusion covering nearly 30 km 2  on northwestern PINK HILLS.   The granite is very well exposed, and forms extensive low rugged hills covered in boulders, tors, and whalebacks; the latter commonly have a reddish appearance on aerial photographs and in the field.","The Pimbyana Granite is named after Pimbyana Creek (Zone 50, MGA 434000E 7350000N) on EDMUND. The name  Pimbyana Granite  was first used by Pearson et al. (1996), who provided a brief description and two whole-rock chemical analyses. The synonym  Pimbyana Granitoid  was introduced by KrapeÅ¾ (1999) but no justification was given for the name change.",,"The most abundant rock type of the Pimbyana Granite is a coarse-grained porphyritic to megacrystic biotite(-muscovite) monzogranite to syenogranite (P_-DUpi-gmw). Where the granite contains abundant inclusions of metasedimentary and mafic meta-igneous rocks it is mapped as a separate unit (P_-DUpi-gmi). The phenocrysts and megacrysts (>5 cm) that characterize the Pimbyana Granite typically comprise 20-40% of the rock, and are tabular.  Phenocrysts are commonly aligned to form an igneous foliation, which typically trends subparallel to the regional tectonic foliation in the area. Tabular phenocrysts and megacrysts typically have a microperthitic texture, and commonly contain inclusions of quartz, plagioclase, and biotite. However, in places the granite contains abundant rounded megacrysts of up to 8 cm in diameter, some with graphic textures. For example, northeast of Bald Hill North, and between Bald Hill North and Henderson Bore on the southern part of EDMUND, the Pimbyana Granite locally contains rounded megacrysts of K-feldspar that are up to 7 cm long and 6 cm wide. Some of them are concentrated in narrow zones or channels where they may comprise up to 90% of the rock. Groundmass muscovite and biotite are commonly partly recrystallized, with some biotite replaced by chlorite. Sericitization of plagioclase is accompanied by titanite pseudomorphs after ilmenite or titanomagnetite.",,,,,"Throughout the Mangaroon Zone, the Pimbyana Granite intrudes metasedimentary rocks of the Pooranoo Metamorphics. Near the margins of intrusions, inclusions and screens of metasedimentary rock may also be abundant. Elsewhere the granite typically contains scattered small (<5 cm diameter), dark grey inclusions of biotite-rich metapelitic rock. Inclusions of vein quartz are locally abundant. On the southern part of TOWERA and the northern part of LYNDON, the granite intrudes, and is locally in faulted contact with, psammitic schists of the Pooranoo Metamorphics (P_-PO-xmtsf-gmv, P_-PO-xmtsf-gmvt). The granite appears as thin veins and dykes that are subparallel to the main tectonic fabrics. However, the granite also forms more discrete outcrops where it is generally strongly deformed into augen gneiss (e.g. FJK0000166, Zone 50, MGA 331731E 7397158N).  On northwestern PINK HILLS, the Pimbyana Granite intrudes units of the Leake Spring Metamorphics (P_-LS-mlsm, P_-LS-mlsg) and Moorarie Supersuite (P_-MOru-mgm, P_-MO-mgg).  The megacrystic monzogranite to syenogranite phase is intruded by both the Dingo Creek (P_-DUdi-grpv) and Yangibana Granites (P_-DUyn-gmv), extensive veins and dykes of muscovite-biotite granite (P_-DU-gmv), and tourmaline-bearing granite and pegmatite (P_-DU-gmvt, P_-DU-gpt). However, muscovite-biotite granite (P_-DU-gmv) and tourmaline-bearing granite (P_-DU-gmvt) appear to pre-date the Pimbyana Granite on LYNDON and TOWERA.  The Pimbyana Granite is unconformably overlain by the Yilgatherra Formation at the base of the Edmund Group along the flanks of the Mangaroon Syncline on central and western MANGAROON and on EDMUND.  About 200 m northwest of the Frasers-Yangibana prospect on south-central EDMUND, fine- to medium-grained and equigranular to sparsely porphyritic tonalite (P_-DUpi-gt) locally grades into medium-grained granite with scattered tabular K-feldspar megacrysts (2-6 cm long). The megacrystic phase locally forms veins in the tonalite. However, the irregular nature of the veins and dykes, and the cuspate and lobate nature of the contacts suggest that the tonalite was not fully crystallized when intruded by the megacrystic granite.",,17,,,,4,,,,1675,11,1673,15,"The main phases of the Pimbyana Granite (P_-DUpi-gmw) have been dated using SHRIMP U-Pb in zircon. A porphyritic biotite-muscovite syenogranite from a site 5 km southeast of the Yangibana Bore on EDMUND has an igneous crystallization age of 1673 Â± 15 Ma (Nelson, 2002). A porphyritic to megacrystic biotite(-muscovite) monzogranite from the same phase 4 km southeast of Coorabie Tank on MANGAROON yielded an igneous crystallization age of 1675 Â± 11 Ma (Nelson, 2005). The sample from EDMUND also has a xenocrystic zircon age component dated at 1788 Â± 17 Ma, which is within uncertainty of the crystallization age of the Gooche Gneiss (P_-MOgo-mgn). The geochronology suggests that there is little or no age difference between the porphyritic to megacrystic phase of the Pimbyana Granite (P_-DUpi-gmw) and the fine- to medium-grained tonalite and granodiorite (P_-DUpi-gt), with an age of 1674 Â± 8 Ma.

It was deposited in marine and possibly continental, glacially influenced settings. Evidence for glacial influence and other lithological characteristics suggest correlation with the Sturtian glacial succession of central and South Australia.","The Pirrilyungka Formation is known only from Vines 1 in the southern Officer Basin, below 779.2 m. It may be present in outcrop, and mapped as Lupton Formation, but this cannot be proven or disproven from available data.","The Pirrilyungka Formation (Haines et al., 2008) is named after Pirrilyungka Outstation, on COOPER 1:250 000 sheet (26 deg 31min 48sec S 128deg 25min 47sec E), and extends from 779.2 m to total depth (2017 m) in Vines 1. The base was not intersected, and the unit extends for an unknown depth below the total depth of Vines 1. This interval is continuously cored. It was previously included in the Vines Formation. The formation can be subdivided into an upper unit above approximately 1600 m, dominated by diamictite and conglomerate with lesser sandstone and mudstone, and a unit below that is dominated by interbedded sandstone and mudstone with minor diamictite.",,"The following narrative is excerpted from Haines et al. (2008).  The Pirrilyungka Formation consists of dark-grey diamictite with local reddish brown horizons, sandstone, mudstone and pebble conglomerate. The formation can be subdivided into an upper unit above approximately 1600 m, dominated by diamictite and conglomerate with lesser sandstone and mudstone, and a unit below that is dominated by interbedded sandstone and mudstone with minor diamictite. Diamictite throughout is dominantly grey to black, with scattered brown to reddish intervals up to about 2 m thick (e.g. 1174.9 - 1176.4 m). Clasts are mostly light-grey carbonates, fine clastic rocks and chert, with few volcanic or granitic clasts. Striated or faceted clasts, most commonly fine-grained carbonates, are present throughout the diamictite intervals but are not abundant. There are rare clasts composed of stromatolitic dolostone and probable magnesite, both resembling lithologies present in the upper Buldya Group. Mudstone intervals are common, and several metres thickness of laminated chocolate-brown mudstone and siltstone rhythmite is present around 1450 and 1480 m. These were interpreted as distal turbidites by Apak et al. (2002) and Stevens et al. (2002), but the extreme regularity of the lamination and rare dropstone fabrics within them ld Haines et al. (2008) to suggest they are glacial varves. The sandstone - mudstone-dominated unit below 1600 m displays individual massive sandstone intervals with beds up to 2 - 2.5 m thick commonly with dish-like dewatering structures, normal and reverse grading, abundant slumping, shale intraclasts, sandstone - shale alternations, and massive diamictites with a shaly matrix.","The following narrative is adapted from Haines et al. (2008).  The sedimentary facies within the Pirrilyungka Formation below 1600 m in Vines 1 are suggestive of a relatively deep water (?marine) massflow to turbidity current setting. Angular granite pebbles in thin diffuse layers below 2006 m may be reworked diamictites, and suggest that glacigene conditions were present to total depth in the hole. Rhythmites at about 1450 and 1480 m are suggestive of glacial varves, deposited in deep quiet conditions. Clast-supported pebble conglomerate beds are present above 1230 m, and suggest upwards shallowing to shallow-marine or continental conditions, with pebbly outwash.",1238,1239,,"The Pirrilyungka Formation is overlain, apparently unconformably, by Wahlgu Formation, and probably overlies equivalents of the upper Buldya Group (based on probably reworked palynomorphs and stromatolites), but the contact is not observed.

937,39078,P_-PJ-xmg-mo,1,Pitjantjatjara Supersuite,1,"Metagranite, granitic gneiss, and metamorphosed intrusive mafic rocks","The Pitjantjatjara Supersuite (Edgoose et al., 2004; formerly the  Kulgera Suite  of Major and Conor, 1993) incorporates all igneous rocks formed during the c. 1220 to 1150 Ma Musgrave Orogeny. The supersuite comprises massive to strongly foliated rocks of granitic protolith with subordinate felsic gneiss and mafic granulite, and dominates both bedrock and outcrop in the north and northeast of the west Musgrave Province (Walpa Pulka Zone). These rocks are notably less common in the southwest of the west Musgrave Province (Mamutjarra Zone). The magmatic crystallization ages of these rocks show a broad trend towards younger ages in the southwest, and their distribution pattern shows an antithetic relationship to rocks of the older Wankanki Supersuite. Most granites of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite are metaluminous, K-rich, A-type granites.","Rocks of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite are voluminous, and are distributed throughout the Musgrave Province. They dominate both bedrock and outcrop in the north and northeast of the west Musgrave Province (Walpa Pulka Zone), where they form large plutonic bodies. They are notably less common in the southwest of the west Musgrave Province (Mamutjarra Zone), where they mainly occur as dykes, small intrusions, or as migmatitic melt veins and sheets. Their distribution pattern is antithetic to rocks of the older Wankanki Supersuite.",The name  Pitjantjatjara Supersuite  was first used by Edgoose et al. (2004) for rocks formerly grouped into the  Kulgera Suite  by Major and Conor (1993).,,"Rocks of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite represent the magmatic expression of the Musgrave Orogeny. This is the oldest orogenic event to have clearly affected all areas of the west Musgrave Province, involving intense deformation and widespread crustal reworking. Most rocks of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite have been metamorphosed at granulite-facies conditions, in some cases as a result of thermal peaks late in the Musgrave Orogeny, but mostly as a result of the 1085-1040 Ma Giles Event. Parts of the Musgrave region were once deeply buried beneath Neoproterozoic sedimentary basins, with rapid differential uplift of the Walpa Pulka Zone (mainly BATES) and possibly some fault-bound blocks within the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone (mainly on HOLT) during the c. 550 Ma Petermann Orogeny, exposing metamorphic assemblages that reflect pressures as high as 10-14 kbar (Scrimgeour and Close, 1999). The metamorphosed rocks of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite range from statically recrystallized and unfoliated, to strongly foliated and mylonitized. Rocks with granitic protoliths greatly dominate the supersuite at the present exposure level, although rafts of metagabbro form a minor component of the supersuite in the Walpa Purlka Zone, and rare norite dykes occur in the Mamutjarra Zone (COOPER). In the Walpa Pulka Zone and the northeastern parts of the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone, rocks of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite can be broadly divided, based on age of intrusion, into an early (P_- PJp1-; 1220-1200 Ma) and late (P_-PJp2-; 1190- 1150 Ma) Pitjantjatjara Supersuite (Howard et al., 2006). However, it should be noted that on a province-wide scale, granitic magmatism was more or less continuous throughout the Musgrave Orogeny. Outcrop of the early Pitjantjatjara Supersuite is mainly restricted to the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone and southwestern part of the Walpa Pulka Zone, whereas outcrop of the late Pitjantjatjara Supersuite occurs throughout the west Musgrave Province but is concentrated in the northeastern part of the Walpa Pulka Zone.  The primary (protolith) mineralogy of most granites in the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite was an essentially anhydrous assemblage of quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, and biotite, although late hornblende locally rims pyroxene. However, retrograde recrystallization is locally associated with foliation development, resulting in the partial to near-complete alteration of pyroxene to hornblende, actinolite, and biotite. Garnet occurs in rocks north of the Mann Fault and east of the Fanny Fault, typically forming fine-grained coronas that separate the mafic minerals, including orthopyroxene, from feldspar, and reflecting a high-pressure metamorphic assemblage exhumed during the Petermann Orogeny.  Granites of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite can be broadly subdivided into three lithological groups. The first and most voluminous group, found in both the early and late Pitjantjatjara Supersuites, typically ranges from granodiorite to syenogranite, although the full range is from monzodiorite to alkali-feldspar granite. Where primary igneous textures are preserved, this group commonly includes rounded rapakivi-textured feldspar phenocrysts up to 5 cm in diameter. Many of these rocks retain evidence of a primary orthopyroxene-bearing mineralogy, and on that basis can be classified as charnockites. This porphyritic granodiorite-syenogranite group dominates the outcrop in the Walpa Pulka Zone, occurring as large composite plutonic bodies, and forms smaller plutons and dykes in the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone. Within the Mamutjarra Zone, these rocks are mostly restricted to dykes and minor intrusions, although in the northwest of that zone (FINLAYSON and COOPER) they form a widespread, but non-continuous, collection of small intrusions.  This first group of Pitjantjatjara Supersuite granites typically does not contain abundant enclaves, and, despite other local evidence for mixing or mingling (e.g. dykes terminating in chains of lobate inclusions), there is no field evidence at the present level of exposure for significant physical interaction between individual granite intrusions, or between these and any other magma batches. Several broad intrusion styles are identified. Most exposures show significant variations in texture (from seriate to porphyritic to megacrystic) and grain size on a scale of a metre to many tens of metres, suggesting that larger bodies are composite intrusions of numerous individual dykes and sills. Geochemical data show that individual intrusions, or collections of intrusions (forming individual granite suites), are either compositionally heterogeneous throughout, or else show a systematic compositional variation that parallels the northwest trend of major shear zones (Smithies et al., 2010).  The second group of Pitjantjatjara Supersuite granites is entirely restricted to the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone, and comprises locally schlieric biotite-orthopyroxene leucogranites typically in the monzogranite to syenogranite compositional range. These form veins and sheets that cut and engulf earlier rocks of the Wirku Metamorphics and Wankanki Supersuite. Originally thought to be restricted to the late Pitjantjatjara Supersuite (P_-PJp2-mgsi, P_- PJp2- jmgs-mn), petrographically and geochemically identical rocks are now also known from the early (P_- PJp1-mgmu) Pitjantjatjara Supersuite (Smithies et al., 2010).  The third group of Pitjantjatjara Supersuite granites consists of a granofelsic and schlieric leucogranite unit (P_-PJp2-mge). The protolith to these rocks formed sheets and veins that intruded and engulfed all earlier lithologies, including other members of the supersuite and older paragneisses, within the Walpa Pulka Zone and Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone. They are interpreted as locally derived anatectic melts, and mainly belong to the late Pitjantjatjara Supersuite.  Geochemical data from both the Northern Territory (Edgoose et al., 2004) and Western Australia (Smithies et al., 2010) indicate that the felsic rocks (apart from the felsic granofels) of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite are compositionally uniform across the entire Musgrave Province. Granites of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite are silicic (57-78 wt% SiO2) and K-rich rocks with high total alkali content (Na2O + K2O to 10.3 wt%) and high incompatible trace element concentrations, features consistent with an A-type classification. Smithies et al. (2010) subdivided the granites of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite in Western Australia into several geochemically coherent suites; of these, only the Mirturtu Suite (P_-PJM-) is distinguishable on the current 1:100 000 series maps (BATES; Howard et al., 2006).",,,,,In the northern part of the Musgrave Province the rocks of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite are unconformably overlain by the Cobb Formation.,,17,,,Mixed,8,,,,1219,,1148,,"The oldest Pitjantjatjara Supersuite outcrop identified so far within the west Musgrave Province, from the Walpa Pulka Zone (BATES), has a protolith magmatic crystallization age of 1219 Â± 12 Ma (GSWA 174737, Bodorkos et al., 2008). The youngest rocks are from the Mamutjarra Zone, and include a metagranite with a protolith magmatic crystallization age of 1148 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 189522, Kirkland et al., 2013a) and a metanorite dyke with a protolith magmatic crystallization age of 1149 Â± 10 Ma (GSWA 194376, Kirkland et al., 2010). Thus, the age range of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite within the west Musgrave Province is from 1219 Â± 12 Ma to 1148 Â± 6 Ma (i.e. 1220-1150 Ma).  The youngest late Pitjantjatjara Supersuite granite in the Walpa Pulka Zone has been dated at 1157 Â± 9 Ma (GSWA 189523, Kirkland et al., 2009a), and is an unfoliated granite dyke that cuts an early Musgrave Orogeny foliation. Zircons from early Pitjantjatjara Supersuite granites commonly have rims with ages reflecting growth (or regrowth) during late Musgrave Orogeny events.

Mafic magmatism did not form a significant component of the Musgrave Orogeny, as seen at present outcrop level. Mafic dykes of this age are extremely rare, and the granites themselves do not typically contain mafic enclaves. Nevertheless, rare leucogabbro intruded the Walpa Pulka Zone during the late Musgrave Orogeny at 1190 Â± 9 Ma (GSWA 174594, Bodorkos and Wingate, 2008), and rare norite dykes cut the Mamutjarra Zone at 1149 Â± 10 Ma (GSWA 194376, Kirkland et al., 2010).

In the Walpa Pulka Zone and adjacent parts of the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone, these rocks have been divided, based on age, into an early (P_-PJp1- in code notation; 1220-1200 Ma) and late (P_-PJp2-; 1190-1150 Ma) Pitjantjatjara Supersuite (Howard et al., 2006; Smithies et al., 2009, 2010). However, it should be noted that on a province-wide scale, granitic magmatism was more or less continuous throughout the Musgrave Orogeny. In this respect, the division between the older and younger group is somewhat arbitrary, but is retained here as a useful way of subdividing the supersuite. Outcrop of the early Pitjantjatjara Supersuite is mainly restricted to the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone and southwestern part of the Walpa Pulka Zone, whereas outcrop of the late Pitjantjatjara Supersuite occurs throughout the west Musgrave Province but is concentrated in the northeastern part of the Walpa Pulka Zone. Apart from this slight difference in geographic range, there appears to be no significant difference between the rocks of the early and late Pitjantjatjara Supersuite in terms of deformation, metamorphic and primary mineralogy, and compositional range (Smithies et al., 2010), except that mafic rocks (which are in any case a very rare component of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite) are unknown from the early Pitjantjatjara Supersuite.

Outcrop of the early Pitjantjatjara Supersuite is mainly restricted to the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone (mainly on HOLT) and southwestern part of the Walpa Pulka Zone (BATES), to the southwest of the Fanny Fault, where it forms large plutonic bodies. These plutons are best exposed in the region around Mount Fanny in the central-western part of BATES. Small and less continuous outcrop of early Pitjantjatjara Supersuite granites occurs in the area south of Boundary Peak and Latitude Hills (BELL ROCK), and around Prostanthera Hill (HOLT).",,,"In the Walpa Pulka Zone, rocks of the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite have been divided, based on age, into an early (P_-PJp1- in code notation; 1220-1200 Ma) and late (P_-PJp2-; 1190-1150 Ma) Pitjantjatjara Supersuite (Howard et al., 2006; Smithies et al., 2009, 2010).

As a result, the following description also summarizes the description for the parent Pitjantjatjara Supersuite unit (P_-PJ-xg-o), and is virtually identical to the description for the late Pitjantjatjara Supersuite (P_-PJp2-mg).  Most rocks of the early Pitjantjatjara Supersuite have been metamorphosed at granulite-facies conditions, and range from statically recrystallized and unfoliated to strongly foliated and mylonitized. The primary (protolith) mineralogy of most of these granites was an essentially anhydrous assemblage of quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, and biotite, although late hornblende locally rims pyroxene, becoming a significant component of the primary mafic mineralogy of the more evolved granites in the supersuite. In addition, retrograde recrystallization is locally associated directly with foliation development, resulting in the partial to near-complete alteration of pyroxene to hornblende, actinolite, and biotite. Garnet occurs in rocks north of the Mann Fault and east of the Fanny Fault, typically as fine-grained coronas that separate the mafic minerals, including orthopyroxene, from feldspar, and reflecting a high-pressure metamorphic assemblage exhumed during the Petermann Orogeny.  Granites of the early Pitjantjatjara Supersuite can be broadly subdivided into two lithological groups. The first and most voluminous group typically ranges from granodiorite to syenogranite, although the full range is from monzodiorite to alkali-feldspar granite. Where primary igneous textures are preserved, this group commonly includes rounded rapakivi-textured feldspar phenocrysts up to 5 cm in diameter. Many of these rocks retain evidence of a primary orthopyroxene-bearing mineralogy, and on that basis can be classified as charnockites. This porphyritic granodiorite-syenogranite group dominates the Walpa Pulka Zone, occurring as large composite plutonic bodies, and forming smaller plutons and dykes in the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone. These rocks are very rare within the Mamutjarra Zone, where they are restricted to dykes and minor intrusions.

The compositional layering is parallel to the long axis of the body and locally contains magmatic state kinematic indicators, such as melt-filled extensional C' shear bands that give an apparent dextral sense of shear, suggesting the monzogranite is syn-kinematic.

The feldspars are generally subhedral, <5 mm long, and aligned parallel to, and at a low-angle to the solid-state foliation. The feldspars also form elongate, irregular, recrystallised aggregates that are also aligned parallel to the solid-state foliation. The quartz forms grey (semi-opaque), elongate ribbons that are <2 mm wide, and generally <5 mm long, although some ribbons are up to 1 cm-long. The biotite is generally <2 mm long and generally occurs as dispersed grains aligned parallel to the solid-state foliation.//The monzogranite has porphyritic textured layers that contain abundant feldspar phenocrysts. The phenocrystic feldspars are both equant (>1 cm wide) and elongate (<4 cm long), with the elongate grains occurring parallel to the solid-state foliation, and less commonly, at a low angle. The feldspar twins are typically aligned parallel to with the solid-state foliation, suggesting a magmatic alignment of the grains prior to the solid-state overprint. Some feldspar phenocrysts have asymmetric recrystallised tails that indicate a dextral sense of shear (see MJPJUT000289).//The monzogranite contains coarse-grained leucogranite layers up to 5 cm wide. The leucogranite layers are generally uniform in width, have sharp contacts, and are parallel with the foliation. Locally, the leucogranite layers have a broad pinch and swell geometry that is followed by the foliation in the host. In some cases, the pinch and swell geometry is controlled by the distribution of cm scale feldspars along the layer (see MJPJUT000288). Other sheets locally have a lobate contact, suggesting the absence of strain and transposition (see MJPJUT000288). The leucogranite occurs in some small scale (<0.5 m long), melt-filled extensional C' shear bands that give an apparent dextral sense of shear (see MJPJUT000285).

In the Mangaroon Zone, the rocks are commonly gneissic, with migmatitic textures widely developed in the pelites. These metasedimentary and meta-igneous rocks were previously included within the  Leake Spring Metamorphic Suite  (Williams et al., 1983; Williams, 1986). However, protoliths to the Pooranoo Metamorphics in the Mangaroon Zone have a maximum depositional age of c. 1680 Ma, whereas the protoliths to the Leake Spring Metamorphics were deposited, then deformed and metamorphosed before c. 1810 Ma. The thickness of the sedimentary packages in the Mangaroon Zone is unknown. To the south of the Mangaroon Zone, the base of the Pooranoo Metamorphics is assigned to the Mount James Subgroup, formerly the Mount James Formation. This subgroup contains a well-defined laterally continuous stratigraphy comprised of a lower fluvial succession (Biddenew Formation) overlain by shallow marine quartzites of the Spring Camp Formation. The combined stratigraphic thickness for the Mount James Subgroup is at least 700 metres. The maximum depositional age of the subgroup is defined by the age of detrital zircons dated at c. 1760 Ma. It is not clear if the Pooranoo Metamorphics consist of two temporally discrete metasedimentary packages or whether the unit is the expression of a single progressively deepening basin reflecting a transition from fluvial and shallow marine conditions in the south to deeper water in the north.","The Pooranoo Metamorphics outcrop extensively in the Mangaroon Zone in the northern Gascoyne Province, and in the Mutherbukin Zone in the central part of the province. Outliers of Pooranoo Metamorphics are also found on the Minnie Creek batholith in the Limejuice Zone. The Mangaroon Zone is about 70 km wide and is overlain to the west and east by Phanerozoic and Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks, respectively. The Pooranoo Metamorphics in the Mangaroon Zone have not been subdivided into named units as no stratigraphy is apparent. Within the Mutherbukin and Limejuice Zones, the Pooranoo Metamorphics contain a recognizable stratigraphy, and are assigned to the Mount James Subgroup. In these zones, the Mount James Subgroup outcrops over much of southwestern PINK HILLS, and along the southern edge of MOUNT PHILLIPS. Smaller outcrops are present in the southeastern corner of YINNETHARRA and as a series of small outliers in the Mooloo and Paradise Zones on GLENBURGH and in the Errabiddy Shear zone on YALBRA in the southern Gascoyne Province.","The Pooranoo Metamorphics are named after Pooranoo Well (Zone 50, MGA 382249E 7363317N) in the southeastern part of MANGAROON.",,"Across the southern part of the province, in the Paradise, Mooloo, Mutherbukin, and Limejuice Zones, a recognizable stratigraphy allows grouping of units into the Mount James Subgroup. The Subgroup consists of a lower fluvial succession of metaconglomerate, feldspathic metasandstone phyllite or slate and psammitic schist of the Biddenew Formation, which is overlain by shallow marine quartzites and quartz-muscovite schists of the Spring Camp Formation. Further north in the Mangaroon Zone the Pooranoo Metamorphics comprise two main units in roughly equal proportions: psammitic schist and feldspathic metasandstone, and pelitic schist and gneiss. The psammitic schist and feldspathic metasandstone are interlayered with minor pelitic rock and granule metaconglomerate. Graded bedding is preserved in places in the feldspathic metasandstone, and the rocks may be part of a turbiditic sequence. Although no contact relationships have been observed, the apparent transition from the shallow marine quartzites of the Spring Camp Formation northward into turbidite-type deposits in the Mangaroon Zone may suggest a deepening of the basin toward the north.  In the Mangaroon Zone, pelitic schist and gneiss are mainly non-migmatitic, but in the area around the Star of Mangaroon Mine, migmatitic pelitic gneiss is abundant. The migmatites include both diatexites and metatexites. Interlayered cobble and pebble metaconglomerate granule metasandstone, calc-silicate gneiss and schist, and amphibolite and actinolite schist are minor rock types.",,,,,"In the Mangaroon Zone the Pooranoo Metamorphics are juxtaposed with inliers of the c. 1775 Ma Gooche Gneiss (Moorarie Supersuite) by layer-parallel faults, and are intruded extensively by granites of the 1680-1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite. The Pooranoo Metamorphics, including the Mount James Subgroup, are unconformably overlain by sedimentary rocks of the Edmund Group (Bangemall Supergroup). In the Limejuice Zone the metamorphic rocks form isolated small outliers unconformably overlying the Minnie Creek batholith (Moorarie Supersuite). In the Mutherbukin Zone the Mount James Subgroup of the Pooranoo Metamorphics unconformably overlies, or is faulted against, the Halfway Gneiss and granites of the Moorarie Supersuite. Along the northern margin of the Mutherbukin Zone, south of the Ti Tree Syncline, psammitic and pelitic schist of the Mount James Subgroup is intruded by granite and pegmatite of the Thirty Three Supersuite.",,17,,,,2,,,,1758,,1682,,"The best constrained ages of the Pooranoo Metamorphics come from samples in the Mangaroon Zone; however, the stratigraphic position of these samples within the package is unknown, although it is thought that they form the younger parts of the basin, i.e. they stratigraphically overly the Mount James Subgroup.  A sample of pelitic gneiss (P_-PO-mln; GSWA 169094) with sparse leucosomes from southeast of Maroonah Homestead contains zircons as young as 1680 Â± 10 Ma, as well as significant older age components (recalculated from Nelson, 2004). The youngest grains in this sample (c. 1680 Ma) are now interpreted to have grown within the thin leucosomes during D 1m  metamorphism and intrusion of the oldest Durlacher Supersuite granites (including P_-DU-ggp, which the gneiss is in contact with). This interpretation is in contrast to that of Nelson (2004) and Sheppard et al. (2005) who interpreted these zircons to be detrital components within the rock. Excluding these younger grains, the next oldest population, which is interpreted to be of detrital origin, is dated at 1751 Â± 10 Ma (11 grains), and is the youngest detrital component in any of the Pooranoo Metamorphic metasedimentary rocks. Six samples (one from the basal unit of the Biddenew Formation, and five from the Spring Camp Formation) of the Mount James Subgroup (P_-POJ-md) yield similar depositional constraints. The samples were collected from a wide geographical area (YALBRA to MOUNT PHILLIPS) and the youngest detrital zircon present in all samples is dated at 1758 Â± 18 Ma (GSWA 183255; Wingate et al., 2009). Because the Mount James Subgroup is thought to lie at the base of the Pooranoo Metamorphics succession, the slightly older constraint for the maximum age of deposition (c. 1758 Ma; which is within uncertainty of the c. 1751 Ma date for the overlying Pooranoo metasedimentary units) may reflect a real difference in the timing of deposition. Therefore, the maximum depositional age for the Pooranoo Metamorphics is taken to be the more conservative estimate, constrained by the youngest detrital zircon from the unit at the base of the sedimentary succession (P_-POb-mlpc), at 1758 Â± 18 Ma.  On the basis of field relationships, the oldest granite to intrude the Pooranoo Metamorphics is a locally schlieric monzogranite (P_-DU-gmbi) of the Durlacher Supersuite. The monzogranite was sampled for SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology and has an igneous crystallization age of 1682 Â± 4 Ma (GSWA 208318; Wingate et al., 2013). The oldest dated granitic rock, however in the Durlacher Supersuite, is a medium-grained, moderately deformed, biotite granodiorite that forms a more even-textured part of abundant, but poorly outcropping schlieric granodiorites. This sample yielded a magmatic crystallization age of 1689 Â± 6 Ma (Wingate et al., 2017). However, gneissic enclaves within this rock yielded zircons with an age of 1808 Â± 4 Ma, indicating that they are part of the Moorarie Supersuite (P_-MO-mggn) and not the Pooranoo Metamorphics (P_-PO-md). Therefore it cannot be demonstrated that this rock intrudes the Pooranoo Metamorphics and so the best estimate of the minimum age for the Pooranoo Metamorphics is provided by sample GSWA 208318 (Wingate et al., 2013) at c. 1682 Ma.",No,,,13,g,No,Published,Yes,Yes,P_,PO,,13,10,a,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

In the type area in the Punkerri Hills it is more than 1200 m thick, and contains a poorly preserved Ediacaran fauna which indicate a shallow marine depsoitional setting. The formation may correlate with the Vines Formation in Vines 1, based on the inferred age of the Vines Formation.","The main outcrop belt of the Punkerri Sandstone is in the Birksgate Sub-basin, on BIRKSGATE and LINDSAY 1:250 000 sheets in South Australia, but the unit probably extends to the northeast corner of WAIGEN, COOPER, and central TALBOT 1:250 000 sheets in Western Australia, based on the recognition of the ?latest Ediacaran to Cambrian Vines Formation in central COOPER 1:250 000 sheet, at the top of Vines 1. The formation is more than 1200 m thick in South Australia (Jackson and van de Graaff, 1981; Morton, 1997), and Jackson and van de Graaff (1981) measured a section in the Patricia Johnson Hills (WAIGEN) about 600 m thick.","The Punkerri Sandstone (Thompson, 1969; 'Punkerri Beds' of Major, 1974; 'Punkerri Formation' of Cockbain and Hocking, 1989; mentioned by Zang, 1995; defined Morton and Drexel, 1997) is a sequence of red and white sandstone of Ediacaran age, defined in South Australia in the Punkerri Hills where it is at least 1200 m thick. Jackson and van de Graaff (1981) extended the unit into Western Australia.",,"The following description is from Grey et al (2005, p. 50). The Punkerri Sandstone consists of pink quartzite and feldspathic sandstone, siltstone, and minor conglomerate and oolitic carbonate. The formation consists of two units at Punkerri Hills: a lower purple or red-brown, medium-grained, micaceous, fl aggy quartzose sandstone, at least 265 m thick, and an upper unit of white, pink, and red feldspathic and quartzose sandstone with minor interbedded red siltstone, which is at least 935 m thick (Major, 1974). The upper unit contains Ediacara fauna fossils (Daily, 1964; Jenkins and Gehling, 1978).  Two units are also present on northeast WAIGEN (Jackson and van de Graaff, 1981): a lower, parallel-bedded to (near the top) cross-bedded, reddish brown sandstone unit about 200 m thick; and an upper, mostly parallel-bedded quartz arenite unit about 400 m thick with some fine-grained sandstone and siltstone intercalations.","The Punkerri Sandstone was deposited mostly in a tidally infl uenced, shallow-marine setting, based on lithology, fauna and sedimentary structures (Grey et al., 2005). The presence of conglomeratic sandstone (Jackson and van de Graaff, 1981) may indicate some fluvial deposition, or a transition into Vines Formation, which is doiminated by reddish pebbly conglomerate, deposited in a fluvial setting.",600,1200,,"Neither the lower nor upper contact is exposed. They are inferred to be regional disconformities. Major (1974) inferred that the Punkerri Sandstone was disconformable on the Wright Hill Formation in South Australia, based on the presence of oolitic chert pebbles probably derived from the Wright Hill Formation in the base of the Punkerri Sandstone. In Western Australia, regional relationships indicate the Punkerri Sandstone overlies Wahlgu Formation, and is transitional laterlally into or overlies Lungkarta Formation.   The  Wirrildar beds  (middle Marla Group) overlie the Punkerri Sandstone in South Australia around Patricia Johnson Hills. No unequivocal outcrops of this unit are known in Western Australia, but it underlies low calcrete mounds near the state border southwest of the Patricia Johnson Hills (Jackson and van de Graaff, 1981), and probably extends at least as far as central COOPER 1:250 000 sheet under Cenozoic cover.",,17,,,,4,,,,635,,541,,"The following is excerpted from Grey et al.

Johnson discovered several fossils (identified as  Rangea arborea ,  Charnia ,  Tribrachidium heraldicum , ? Charniodiscus  and a  double spiral ; Daily, 1964) at the northern end of the Punkerri Hills (Major, 1974). Jenkins and Gehling (1978) re-examined some of the specimens, and Glaessner (1984) subsequently noted the locality. They dismissed one specimen as inorganic. However, a second appears similar to  Charniodiscus , although it is too poorly preserved to be properly identified. The specimens are from scree, but were apparently derived from the upper Punkerri Sandstone.

The group includes weakly to moderately deformed and metamorphosed bimodal volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, and fine- to coarse-grained sedimentary rocks. It lies conformably (although the contact is locally faulted) on the Mount Waugh Formation of the Mount Palgrave Group, but it has an erosional contact with rocks of the Eliza Formation (also of the Mount Palgrave Group) on the western side of the Barrow Range anticline. The  volcanic and volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Cassidy Group (Bentley Supergroup) conformably overlie the Pussy Cat Group. The latter outcrops extensively as an east-southeasterly trending unit that bisects both the MOUNT EVELINE and WARBURTON RANGE map sheets. It also forms scattered outcrops in the southwestern part of COOPER.  A basal unit comprises interbedded clastic and volcaniclastic rocks and basalt, and is conformably overlain by thick deposits of flow-banded and locally rheomorphic ignimbrite that form the Kathleen Ignimbrite. The Kathleen Ignimbrite is overlain by amygdaloidal basalt and siliciclastic units that form the Glyde Formation. Deposition of the group is possibly constrained to around c. 1065 Ma, although dating of eruptive and intrusive unit is problematic because of the presence, in all igneous units of the Talbot Sub-basin, of abundant zircon antecrysts from slightly older stages of magma storage and magma-chamber development. Intrusion of locally voluminous feldspar- and quartz-porphyritic subvolcanic rhyolite was more or less synchronous with felsic volcanism.","The Pussy Cat Group outcrops extensively as an east-southeasterly trending unit, dipping approximately 30&deg; to the southwest, bisecting both the MOUNT EVELINE and WARBURTON RANGE map sheets. It also forms scattered outcrops in the southwestern part of COOPER.","The Pussy Cat Group was initially proposed by Daniels (1974) to include weakly to moderately deformed and metamorphosed bimodal volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, and fine- to coarse-grained sedimentary rocks of the Bentley Supergroup. These rocks were thought to be in faulted contact with the rocks of the Scamp Volcanic Association (now believed to be a locally faulted conformable contact with the reassigned Mount Waugh Formation of the Mount Palgrave Group) and conformably underlie the volcanic and volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Cassidy Group (Bentley Supergroup).  The Pussy Cat Hill from which the group is named is on the central-northern part of the TALBOT 1:250 000 map sheet.",,"The lower volcaniclastic metasedimentary rocks of the Pussy Cat Group comprise a variety of lithologies: dark-coloured, massive to laminated mudstones, siltstones, and shales; planar-bedded, rippled, and trough cross-bedded, well to poorly sorted, partly arkosic or calcareous sandstones; conglomerates; and very poorly sorted, matrix-supported diamictites. The clastic components of these rocks are mainly volcanogenic detritus, representing reworked pyroclastic rocks and erosional products of volcanic extrusive rocks. Flows of amygdaloidal basalt are also present. The volcaniclastic metasedimentary rocks of the lower Pussy Cat Group were deposited in a volcanically active alluvial to fluvio-lacustrine environment. Deposition of coarser clastic rocks in the lower parts of the volcaniclastic succession occurred as episodic high-energy events (flash-flood mud- and debris-flows, or lahars), whereas finer grained rocks were deposited in small lakes and ponds of an alluvial plain. Higher up in the metasedimentary succession, very well sorted, slightly calcareous, planar-bedded to climbing-ripple cross-laminated and hummocky cross-bedded sandstones, outcrop below the base of the Kathleen Ignimbrite. these sandstones indicate deposition in a more extensive, deeper, and more permanent water body.  The Kathleen Ignimbrite is a mappable unit, forming a prominent range of hills, and has a maximum thickness of more than 500 m. It consists mainly of a flow-banded and lava-like rhyolite, which Daniels (1974) interpreted as a densely welded and rheomorphic, originally pyroclastic, deposit (rheoignimbrite). It shows a diverse range of lithofacies, including parts that are very rich in quartz and feldspar phenocrysts. Towards the west, the thickness and phenocryst content decreases and the rock grades into a massive to flow-banded, aphyric, more homogenous rhyolite, indicating that it probably erupted from a volcanic source to the east. Observations supporting a pyroclastic origin are best developed in the eastern exposures, and include the irregular and patchy distribution of quartz and feldspar phenocrysts and crystal fragments, the presence of cognate quartz- and feldspar-phyric rhyolite or microgranite clasts as lithic fragments, and alternating felsic and mafic ash layers in its basal part. Higher up, the Kathleen Ignimbrite grades from a strongly flow-banded rock into a eutaxitic, fiamme-textured rock that is overlain by a stratified succession of fine- to coarse-grained, commonly crystal-rich, rhyolitic lapilli-ash tuffs, including relicts of glass shards near the top. At its base, the Kathleen Ignimbrite also contains upwardly intruded clastic dykes of volcaniclastic material from the lower part of the Pussy Cat Group, indicating that the ignimbrite was deposited rapidly onto semiconsolidated, water-bearing, volcaniclastic sediments. Finely laminated siliceous ash tuffs in the upper, well-stratified part of the Kathleen Ignimbrite contain flame structures that strongly resemble sedimentary structures normally seen in subaqueous settings. As a subaqueous setting is indicated by the presences of hummocky cross-bedded and climbing ripple cross-laminated sandstones that underlie the Kathleen Ignimbrite, it is speculated that the Kathleen Ignimbrite was also deposited in a large water body.  The Glyde Formation overlies the Kathleen Ignimbrite, and is dominated by extrusive metabasaltic lavas, which vary from massive to, more commonly, highly amygdaloidal. Most of the metabasalts are aphyric, although plagioclase-phyric varieties are present. In rare cases, ropy lava surfaces can be observed. Intercalated within these lavas are thin horizons of metasedimentary rocks, including epidotitic/cherty pelites, quartzites, and siliceous microbialites (stromatolites). These intercalations indicate the presence of running and standing water during the deposition of the basaltic lavas. No pillow lavas have been found, and autoclastic metabasalt breccias are quite rare. East of Mount Shaw, possible hyaloclastite breccias are observed in association with amygdaloidal metabasalt, quartzite, and microbialite mudstone. Therefore, it appears that the majority of the Glyde Formation lavas were erupted and deposited subaerially, and they entered small water bodies locally to form peperites and hyaloclastites. ",,,,,"The Pussy Cat Group lies conformably (although the contact is locally faulted) on the Mount Waugh Formation of the Mount Palgrave Group, but has an erosional contact with rocks of the Eliza Formation (also of the Mount Palgrave Group) on the western side of the Barrow Range anticline. The Pussy Cat Group is conformably overlain by the volcanic and volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Cassidy Group.",,17,,,Mixed,2,,,,1077,,1047,,"The basal contact of the Pussy Cat Group is a locally faulted, although conformable, contact with the Mount Waugh Formation at the top of the Mount Palgrave Group. Thus, a date of 1065 Â± 9 Ma (GSWA 195230; GSWA, preliminary data) obtained directly from a sample of the Mount Waugh Formation possibly represents the maximum age constraint on the deposition of rocks of the Pussy Cat Group. The upper contact of the Pussy Cat Group with the overlying Wururu Rhyolite of the Cassidy Group is conformable. A date of 1065 Â± 5 Ma (GSWA 174690, Kirkland et al., 2011a) obtained directly from a sample of the Wururu Rhyolite possibly represents the minimum age constraint on the deposition of rocks of the Pussy Cat Group. Where the Kathleen Ignimbrite is not in intrusive contact with the feldspar-porphyritic rhyolite, these contacts with volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks are locally peperitic, indicating that the entire depositional sequence was essentially synchronous. However, although a 1062 Â± 8 Ma date (GSWA 195001, GSWA, preliminary data) obtained from feldspar-porphyritic rhyolite underlying the Kathleen Ignimbrite is consistent with the minimum and maximum age bracket of the Pussy Cat Group, older dates from the ignimbrite (1071 Â± 5 Ma, GSWA 195723, GSWA, preliminary data) and from feldspar-porphyritic rhyolite that overlies it (1076 Â± 5 Ma, GSWA 195031, GSWA, preliminary data; and 1078 Â± 5 Ma, GSWA 195058 GSWA, preliminary data) are at the older extreme of, or exceed, that age bracket. This highlights a problem common to dating of all igneous rocks of the Talbot Sub-basin.  It is likely that the dates from these rocks represent the mean age of zircon crystallization, including that of locally abundant antecrysts, but not the age of magmatic crystallization of those rocks. Rather, crystal-laden (including zircon) magma resided in a near-solidus state in subvolcanic chambers for several millions of years (from c. 1075 Ma) before it was remobilized and erupted (Kathleen Ignimbrite) or intruded (feldspar-porphyritic rhyolite). Evidence for this is found in the textures of the zircon crystals, which have complex magmatic zoning, and dissolution and regrowth patterns from magmas with very different Th and U concentrations. It is now recognized that all felsic igneous rocks of the Talbot Sub-basin include a large proportion of recycled cognate material (i.e. antecrysts). The unavoidable inclusion of these in the dated zircon samples means that all previously interpreted crystallization ages have likely been variably overestimated (i.e. true ages of volcanic deposition or intrusive crystallization should be younger).  Smithies et al. (2013) suggested that the most conservative age range for magmatic activity within the Talbot Sub-basin is probably between c. 1077 and c. 1047 Ma although dating of individual zircons interpreted to be antecrysts indicates a maximum possible range from 1116 Â± 28 to 1010 Â± 20 Ma.",No,,,3,,No,Published,Yes,No,P_,PU,,,,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,No,No

This light grey, fine- to medium-grained, seriate, biotite-poor (<5%), biotite monzogranite is interlayered with grey, fine- to medium-grained, equigranular to seriate, biotite-rich (8-10%), biotite monzogranite. The bands of biotite-poor and biotite-rich monzogranite form a complex, banded biotite quartzofeldspathic gneiss. The biotite-rich bands may constitute highly-deformed, disrupted dykes or enclaves, and are generally sub-parallel and typically parallel to a moderately NE-dipping, SSE-striking foliation that developed after generation of the gneiss. Both phases are cut by several generations of thin, syn- and post-kinematic felsic granite and pegmatite veins, minor late quartz veins, and rare late monzogranite dykes.The sample has a granoblastic texture. Principal minerals are quartz (30-35%), plagioclase (30-35%), K-feldspar (30-35%) and biotite (5-7%). Plagioclase occurs as subhedral grains with no visible zoning, variably developed and locally bent twinning, and rare minor myrmekite. The plagioclase is commonly partly altered to white mica, carbonate and/or epidote/clinozoisite, and contains traces of hematite. K-feldspar is generally anhedral, commonly with tarten twinning and minor perthite. Quartz is anhedral, and mostly has weakly to moderately developed undulose extinction. Biotite occurs as aligned, pale yellow to dark-brown flakes that are locally partly altered to chlorite and rutile and/or white mica. Accessory phases include zircon, opaque minerals and apatite. Secondary minerals are minor white mica, chlorite, rutile, and trace epidote/clinozoisite and hematite. (Geoscience Australia Record 2003/15, 2001967019A).

Many of the pelitic gneisses are migmatitic, indicating that they have been metamorphosed at high metamorphic grade; however, in the southeast and west-southwest part of the Errabiddy Shear Zone, the Quartpot Pelite and the Petter Calc-silicate lack any evidence for migmatization, consistent with a decrease in metamorphic grade from northwest to southeast across the Errabiddy Shear Zone. The Quartpot Pelite was sourced from a currently unexposed Paleoproterozoic terrane with an age of 2095-2000 Ma (possibly a proto-Dalgaringa arc), during the earliest event (D 1g ) of the Glenburgh Orogeny.","The Quartpot Pelite of the Camel Hills Metamorphics outcrops extensively within the Errabiddy Shear Zone on the eastern part of ERRABIDDY and the southern edge of LANDOR, and extends west-southwest onto the northern part of the ERONG.

To the southeast and west-southwest, medium-grade metasedimentary rocks of both the Quartpot Pelite and the Petter Calc-silicate are present, consistent with a decrease in metamorphic grade from northwest to southeast across the Errabiddy Shear Zone.  The migmatites commonly show stromatic, schollen (raft), and nebulitic structures (nomenclature after Mehnert, 1968; Ashworth, 1985), with medium-grained, heterogeneous, siliceous diatexite melt locally forming up to 70% of the rock. Within the melt phase, lenticular rafts of restite consisting of refractory psammite and biotite-rich material are preserved. In places, veins of more homogeneous, externally derived melt cut the in situ migmatite. In places, the stromatic migmatites grade into nebulitic migmatite, indicating local increased degrees of in situ partial melting.  At the northern end of the Quartpot Pelite outcrop on ERRABIDDY, and on northern ERONG, medium-grade pelitic gneiss and schist contain only small amounts of leucosome, but show little evidence of having melted.

The samples also contain two distinct age components, at c. 2250 and c. 2175 Ma, and individual zircons as old as c. 2890 Ma (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011). Calculated zircon crystallinity suggests that the range of zircon dates between c. 2095 and c. 1985 Ma in all three samples reflects the true ages of the zircons and does not result from variable loss of radiogenic Pb (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011). Significant age components for the combined data from all three samples can be resolved at c. 2080, c. 2075, c. 2065, c. 2050, c. 2030, c. 2025, andc.  2000 Ma, and reflect derivation from a source or sources of different ages (Johnson et al., 2010, 2011). The youngest age component, at 2001 Â± 26 Ma, is interpreted as a maximum age of deposition of the sedimentary protolith.  Two samples (GSWA 142905 and 142910) contain high-U, low Th/U structureless zircon rims that are interpreted to have grown during high grade D 2g  metamorphism (Johnson et al., 2010).

Currently there are no known rocks in the Gascoyne Province with ages between c. 2080 and c. 2005 Ma and therefore the source of these abundant detrital zircons is unknown.

",,"Hunter (1993) described the Railway Dam Metagranodiorite as a medium- to coarse-grained, leucocratic granite with sparse biotite that forms a weak to moderate foliation parallel to a streaky orientation of feldspars and quartz. Quartz, which is relatively abundant, is commonly blebby and elongate parallel to biotite foliation, while locally it forms large, irregular grains enclosing feldspar. Local streaking in the gneiss defines random symmetrical folds.  A thin section of the Railway Dam Metagranodiorite from the type locality is a biotite-bearing, oligoclase granodiorite containing sparse microcline and accessory apatite, zircon, and monazite.

These form outcrops approximately 10-15 km in diameter.",,,"Foliated biotite metamonzogranite is generally equigranular and coarse-grained, locally grading into domains dominated by K-feldspar megacrystic monzogranite. Muscovite is locally abundant in places, typically near the intrusive contacts with host greenstone lithologies. The metamonzogranite commonly shows a pervasive, generally north-trending tectonic foliation that typically is more intensely developed along the contacts with amphibolite and metasedimentary xenoliths. Localized, typically 10-50 cm-wide, north-trending mylonites occur in places. A representative example of such localized high-strain zones occurs at FXCYAL000275 (Zone 50, MGA449576E, 6860078N). On BUNGAR, the foliated biotite metamonzogranite includes slivers of older metagranodiorite, typically interlayered with 20 cm-thick amphibole-rich lenses that are commonly aligned parallel to gneissic foliation in host metagranodiorite.

1493,75984,A-_rt-xuk-bk,1,Roundtop Komatiite,1,Komatiite and komatiitic basalt; metamorphosed,"The Roundtop Komatiite is an extensive unit in the Lake Johnston greenstone belt of the Youanmi Terrane in the Yilgarn Craton that hosts economic nickel deposits. Previous studies by Buck et al. (1998) and Heggie et al. (2012a, b) identified three major components within the formation: a western component consisting of extrusive komatiite that rests conformably on the Honman Formation, and central and eastern intrusive components that were emplaced into the underlying Maggie Hays Formation and lower levels of the Honman Formation. Rocks within the Roundtop Komatiite are typically altered and metamorphosed and may include serpentinite, (talc-)tremolite-chlorite schist, and local metamorphic olivine. Igneous textures such as olivine-spinifex and cumulate textures are commonly preserved despite the metamorphic overprint.","The Roundtop Komatiite extends along the entire length of the Lake Johnston greenstone belt from southeast of Mount Glasse (Zone 51, MGA 288337E 6393907N) on TAY to north of Mount Day (Zone 51, MGA 263750E 6441558N) on ROUNDTOP.","The Roundtop Komatiite is named after ROUNDTOP, which is named after Round Top Hill (Zone 51, MGA 259592E 64383567 N).  Outcrop of the Roundtop Komatiite is rare, typically deeply weathered, and access to drillcore is limited. Thus, the type section is a costean (SSRJHS000001, Zone 51, MGA 267405E 6427856N; SSRJHS000005, Zone 51, MGA 267497E 6427962N), which lies 5.6 km northwest of Maggie Hays Hill (Zone 51, MGA 272518E 6425475N). ",,"Buck et al. (1998) subdivided the the Roundtop Komatiite into western, central and eastern ultramafic components based on drillhole and outcrop observations. However, due to the lack of outcrop, this subdivision cannot be represented on the 1:100 000-scale map interpretation.   The western ultramafic unit (Buck et al., 1998) is up to 400 m thick and consists of a series of differentiated, thin (less than 10 m thick), metamorphosed komatiite flows with well-preserved, greenish grey olivine spinifex-textured flow tops and yellowish brown olivine orthocumulate to mesocumulate flow bases (Heggie et al., 2012a). In costeans northwest of Maggie Hays Hill, the size of olivine plates in flows within the western ultramafic unit increases westward. The 150 m-long type section includes several differentiated komatiite flows with coarse-grained, olivine spinifex-textured komatiite flow tops with olivine blades up to 7 cm across (SSRJHS000002, Zone 51, MGA 267413E 6427863N), and fine- to medium-grained, deeply weathered cumulate ultramafic rocks. The original ultramafic rocks are metamorphosed to serpentinite and talc-tremolite schist. The principal metamorphic and alteration product is talc-carbonate schist, which weathers to a distinctive pale yellow soil. The metamorphic assemblage in spinifex-textured komatiite is tremolite-serpentinite-chlorite and opaque phases.  Undifferentiated metakomatiite of the central ultramafic unit (Heggie et al., 2012a,b) comprises peridotite and dunite (olivine mesocumulate to adcumulate), with pyroxenite along host-rock contacts. It lies below the metamorphosed banded iron-formation of the Honman Formation (A-_hm-cxc-f) in the central part of the Lake Johnston greenstone belt and locally crosscuts stratigraphy. All rocks are metamorphosed and may contain metamorphic olivine, talc, and anthophyllite.  The eastern ultramafic unit is interpreted within the upper levels of the Maggie Hays Formation (A-_mh-xbb-s) where it forms a discontinuous series of lenses that are typically less than 80 m thick. Sparse outcrop and drill chips suggest a series of thin, differentiated metakomatiite flows with a range of magnesium contents (Buck et al., 1998).  The Roundtop Komatiite hosts the Maggie Hays and Emily Ann nickel deposits (Buck et al., 1998; Barnes, 2006; Heggie et al., 2012a,b). The central unit of the Roundtop Komatiite is the main nickeliferous unit, and the eastern unit is considered to be barren, and so has received little attention (Buck et al., 1998; Heggie et al., 2012b).",,,,,"Buck et al. (1998) assumed that the deposition of the western ultramafic unit of the Roundtop Komatiite was coeval with deposition of the underlying Honman Formation. However, Heggie et al. (2012a) have proposed that the intrusive (central ultramafic unit) and extrusive (western ultramafic unit) components of the komatiites are cogenetic, therefore the komatiites must post-date the Honman Formation. The Glasse Formation overlies the Roundtop Formation but the contact is not exposed. The Lake Medcalf Igneous Complex (A-_lm-og) may intrude at the Roundtop Komatiite level, but contacts are not exposed.",,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,2920,,2718,,"The Roundtop Komatiite has not been dated directly and age constraints for the formation have thus been derived from its relationship with other units in the Lake Johnston greenstone belt. The Roundtop Komatiite lies stratigraphically above, and locally intrudes, the Honman Formation (A-_hm-c). Unassigned felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks (A-fd-YYO; A-xmfs-mhs-YYO) that lie structurally below the Honman Formation have a range of ages between c. 2920 and 2725 Ma, including a date at c. 2876 Ma (Wang et al., 1996; Romano et al., 2014; GSWA 207516, preliminary data). A younger limit for the age of the Roundtop Komatiite is provided by a cross-cutting monzogranite intrusion dated at c. 2718 Ma (Romano et al. 2014).  While it is possible that the Honman Formation and overlying formations, including the Roundtop Komatiite, are all younger than c. 2725 Ma (the age of the youngest felsic unit dated from near Round Top Hill), it would require that the entire package were deposited in a very short period of time, considering that the Roundtop Komatiite is intruded by granitic rocks at c. 2718 Ma. Therefore, a more conservative estimate for the maximum age of the Roundtop Komatiite is considered to be c. 2920 Ma or possibly the c. 2876 Ma, the age of probably underlying felsic volcanic units (Romano et al., 2014). These constraints are consistent with ages of similar formations elsewhere in the Youanmi Terrane (Van Kranendonk et al., 2013).",No,,,93,,No,Published,No,No,A,_rt,,26,34,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,No,No

The granite forms elongate plutons parallel to the regional structural grain. It is closely related to another large unit of the supersuite (P_-MO-xmg-m), with which it is in gradational contact. The Rubberoid Granite is strongly layered, and the intrusions are composed of hundreds or thousands of individual magma batches. Two samples from the unit yielded indistinguishable SHRIMP U-Pb zircon igneous crystallization ages of 1791 Â± 4 Ma and 1786 Â± 6 Ma.","The Rubberoid Granite outcrops over a large part of northern PINK HILLS and on CANDOLLE to the east. The unit forms three large elongate plutons, two of which are greater than 250 km 2  and the third about 100 km 2 , as well as a number of smaller plutons and plugs. The plutons strike east-southeasterly or easterly and commonly have irregular shapes, with numerous lobes or tongues of metamonzogranite at the ends of the intrusions.","The Rubberoid Granite (Sheppard et al., 2008) was named after the abandoned Rubberoid Well that straddles the boundary between PINK HILLS and CANDOLLE.",,"The Rubberoid Granite mainly comprises pale grey, medium- to coarse-grained, seriate to porphyritic metamonzogranite, typically with well-developed igneous layering. Most of the rocks contain 5-15% squat tabular to round K-feldspar phenocrysts 1-3 cm long (although in parts they are up to 5 cm long). Macrocrysts of K-feldspar are commonly associated with disaggregated veins of coeval, strongly porphyritic metagranite or meta-pegmatite. In these areas, the abundance of phenocrysts/macrocrysts may reach 25%. Many of the rocks contain an igneous layering defined by variations in grain size, and/or abundances of biotite, and/or phenocrysts of K-feldspar. Layering may also be marked by thin seams of biotite-rich schlieren. Locally, K-feldspar phenocrysts define a flow banding parallel to the layering. Individual layers are typically 0.2 - 5 m thick. The metamonzogranite normally contains about 7-10% biotite, with very little or no muscovite; some fine-grained muscovite or sericite is probably of secondary origin. Most of the metamonzogranite is weakly foliated or massive; the foliation is commonly parallel to the igneous layering. The low state of strain for the majority of the unit is indicated by equant quartz crystals, the lack of a preferred orientation to the biotite, and the unstrained nature of pelitic inclusions.  Biotite-rich, mesocratic metagranodiorite is a minor, although widespread phase of the Rubberoid Granite. The metagranodiorite is typically medium to coarse grained and equigranular. It forms rafts and inclusions within the metamonzogranite. Rarely, for example at SXSPKH008036 (Zone 50, MGA 462651E 7274128N), the Rubberoid Granite contains zones of layered, mixed metagranites; the metagranites range from fine-grained siliceous metamonzogranite through medium- to coarse-grained seriate metamonzogranite to porphyritic metamonzogranite. There may be abundant inclusions up to 0.5 m long of mesocratic metagranodiorite and psammitic schist.  In thin section the metamonzogranite is a weakly recrystallized medium- to coarse-grained rock. Microcline phenocrysts contain inclusions of subhedral to euhedral zoned plagioclase and biotite, and minor quartz. Myrmekite is developed along the margins of most microcline crystals. Plagioclase has a composition around An 40  (andesine) and is weakly sericitized. Biotite is dark brown and forms clusters of fine-grained crystals. Most magnetite or titanomagnetite is replaced by epidote, and quartz shows abundant subgrain development. The mesocratic rocks range from weakly recrystallized biotite metagranodiorite to metatonalite. Plagioclase is andesine (about An 40 ) and is weakly sericitized. Quartz has recrystallized to polygonal subgrains, and all opaque minerals have been pseudomorphed by epidote and titanite. Less than 1% of the rock is muscovite. Some samples contain large prismatic crystals of hydrated allanite.",,,,,"The Rubberoid Granite intrudes several units of the Leake Spring Metamorphics. Inclusions of pelitic and psammitic schist (P_-LS-mhs), amphibolite (P_-LS-mwa), and garnet- or staurolite-bearing pelitic schist and gneiss (P_-LS-mlsg) are widespread in the granite, and may be abundant at the margins of the intrusions. Contacts with mesocratic biotite metagranodiorite to metamonzogranite and pale grey, layered biotite(-muscovite) metamonzogranite (P_-MO-xmg-m) are commonly transitional, being marked by increasing amounts of metagranodiorite and interlayered metamorphic rocks. The Rubberoid Granite is intruded by veins of leucocratic biotite granite, which are in turn cut by dykes and veins of foliated leucocratic, tourmaline granite and pegmatite. On northwestern PINK HILLS, the Rubberoid Granite is intruded by a pluton of megacrystic Pimbyana Granite.  Within the Rubberoid Granite, there are also contacts exposed between the several phases that make up the unit. Although much of the mesocratic metagranodiorite forms slabby inclusions within the metamonzogranite (e.g. site SXSCDL008305, Zone 50, MGA 517759E 7268471N), there are some indications that the two phases are in part coeval. At site SXSPKH007952 (Zone 50, MGA 459215E 7274808N) an irregular and partly lobate contact between fine- to medium-grained biotite-rich metagranodiorite and coarse-grained porphyritic biotite metamonzogranite to south is exposed. At the contact, coarse-grained porphyritic metamonzogranite contains inclusions of the biotite-rich metagranodiorite and forms irregular veins that terminate in clusters of tabular K-feldspar phenocrysts, suggesting mingling between the two precursor magmas. At SXSPKH008036 (Zone 50, MGA 462651E 7274128N) a zone of layered, mixed metagranites is exposed. There are multiple injection events of dykes and veins, all broadly parallel, that give the rocks a banded appearance. The metagranites range from fine-grained siliceous metamonzogranite, through medium- to coarse-grained seriate metamonzogranite to porphyritic metamonzogranite. At site SXSCDL008305 (Zone 50, MGA 517759E 7268471N) deeply weathered porphyritic to megacrystic metamonzogranite is in contact with fine- to medium-grained metamonzogranite about 50 m to the northeast. The contact is marked by an intermingling of each rock type as veins and inclusions, suggesting that the two rock types were coeval. The strongly layered nature of the Rubberoid Granite indicates that the plutons were constructed from multiple injections of magma along an existing tectonic fabric in the surrounding metasedimentary rocks.",,17,,,,4,,,,1791,4,1786,,"Two samples of the Rubberoid Granite on PINK HILLS were collected for SHRIMP U-Pb zircon geochronology: GSWA 190660 and GSWA 188974.

The formation forms steeply dipping (60&deg;), layered, and metamorphosed mafic sills. Up to seven separate sills up to 270 m thick have been identified (Griffin et al., 1993). The Ruins Dolerite intrudes the oldest rocks in the western zone, the Marboo Formation, with some of the sills conformable with bedding. The formation is intruded by granites and high-level porphyries of the Paperbark Supersuite. The Marboo Formation and Ruins Dolerite are unconformably overlain by the c. 1864-1854 Ma felsic extrusives of the Whitewater Volcanics.  The Ruins Dolerite was previously been mapped as the Woodward Dolerite (Gellatly et al., 1969; Gellatly and Halligan, 1971; Derrick and Playford, 1973) which intrudes similar low metamorphic grade turbiditic material of the Olympio Formation in the eastern zone of the Lamboo Province. The eastern and western zones of the Lamboo Province are separate tectonostratigraphic terranes with separate geological histories until they accreted c. 1820 Ma (Tyler et al., 1995). As a result the Ruins Dolerite-Woodward Dolerite correlation was dissolved. Furthermore geochronology analyses have revealed that the Marboo Formation and Ruins Dolerite where deposited, emplaced, deformed, and metamorphosed c. 30 m.y. prior to final deposition of the Olympio Formation in the eastern zone of the Lamboo Province (Griffin et al., 1993).","The Ruins Dolerite is restricted to the western zone of the Lamboo Province, west Kimberley region, north Western Australia. The formation outcrops in a discontinuous belt of Paleoproterozoic crystalline rock on the southwest margin to the Kimberley and Speewah Basins, parallel to the King Leopold Ranges. The Ruins Dolerite forms dark, boulder ridges that define large-scale folds (Griffin et al., 1993).","The Ruins Dolerite first appears in the literature in Griffin et al. (1993), in the GSWA explanatory notes of the LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 map sheet. The formation had been previously mapped as the Woodward Dolerite (Gellatly et al., 1969; Gellatly and Halligan, 1971; Derrick and Playford, 1973; Gellatly et al., 1974).",,"In hand specimen the Ruins Dolerite is a dark grey-green, medium- to coarse-grained, massive or poorly foliated, even-textured or porphyritic rock (Gellatly et al., 1969). The dolerite is mostly non-porphyritic with porphyritic horizons in the upper parts of some sills. The formation contains 1-4 cm, subhedral, tabular phenocrysts and phenocryst aggregates of plagioclase (An 45 -An 65 ; Gellatly et al., 1969). Plagioclase phenocrysts can contain hornblende inclusions and are mostly unzoned. Aggregates of plagioclase phenocrysts up to 20 cm across produce a glomerophorphyritic texture that can constitute up to 20-50% of the rock (Gellatly and Halligan, 1971; Gellatly et al., 1969). Rare elongate hornblende phenocrysts, 3 mm long, have been observed but hornblende is volumetrically dominant over plagioclase in most places. The groundmass consists of hornblende, plagioclase and associate quartz (0.2 mm long), with accessory sphene, ilmenite, ?magnetite, goethite, epidote, zoisite, and chlorite (Gellatly et al., 1969). Gabbro is also found within the Ruins Dolerite in sills up to 20 m thick with a glomeroporphyritic texture (Tyler and Griffin, 1993).  The Ruins Doleriete has been amphibolitized. Sharp hornfelsing contacts have metasomatised the surrounding alumina-rich Marboo Formation metasedimentary rocks producing kyanite-corundum and kyanite-topaz rocks (Gellatly and Halligan, 1971; Griffin et al., 1993).

It crops out in the Taylor Lookout area on southeastern DOCKRELL where it intrudes the Esaw Monzogranite (P_-SOes-mgml) and Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (P_-SOdd-xmb-mf) of the 1912-1904 Ma Sophie Downs Suite (P_-SO-xmg-mv) and all formations in the 1904-1834 Ma Halls Creek Group (P_-HC-xmd-mb) that crop out in the local area. The San Sou Monzogranite is composed of homogenous fine-grained to medium-grained leucocratic biotite monzogranite. A SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age obtained from a sample of the formation produced a date of 1788 Â± 6 Ma, interpreted as the age of magmatic crystallization.","The best studied exposures of the San Sou Monzogranite crop out in one intrusion on the southeastern portion of DOCKRELL, centred on Taylor Lookout (DOCKRELL, MGA Zone 52K 321759E 7909295N) about 86 km south-southwest of Halls Creek. The intrusion is poorly exposed, 4 km at its widest and 15 km at its longest. The San Sou Monzogranite has also been interpreted to crop out northeast of the Cummins Range on Mount Bannerman 1:250 000 (Page et al., 2001; Sheppard et al., 2001); however, these rocks have not been directly dated and are interpreted based on similar whole-rock geochemistry.","The San Sou Monzogranite was first defined on DOCKRELL (Griffin and Tyler, 1994; Tyler et al., 1998) and named after San Sou Bore (DOCKRELL, MGA Zone 52K 327653E 7908756N).

It is a homogeneous, fine-grained to medium-grained leucocratic biotite monzogranite (Tyler et al., 1998). Phenocrysts are uncommon and consist of either microcline or rare plagioclase. The groundmass consists of granular quartz, microcline, plagioclase and lesser reddish-brown biotite. Accessory minerals include euhedral allanite, apatite and zircon. Commonly, quartz has been partially recrystallized to polygonal aggregates. Plagioclase is commonly sericitized, allanite is commonly hydrated and biotite is partly chloritized. Rod-shaped microperthite commonly occurs in microcline. Epidote and titanite are pseudomosphed by magnetite and ilmenite, respectively (Tyler et al., 1998).",The San Sou Monzogranite is entirely intrusive.,,,,"The San Sou Monzogranite is the youngest granitic rock in the Eastern Zone of the Lamboo Province and intrudes both the basement rocks (1912-1904 Ma Sophie Downs Suite; P_-SO-xmg-mv) and the overlying 1904-1834 Ma Halls Creek Group (P_-HC-xmd-mb).

It unconformably overlies metamorphosed bimodal volcanic and granitic basement rocks of the 1912-1904 Ma Sophie Downs Suite (P_-SO-xmg-mv) and is conformably to gradationally overlain by the Brim Rockhole Formation (P_-HCb-xmkt-mv). The formation is intruded by metadolerite and metagabbro sills of the c. 1835 Ma Woodward Dolerite (P_-_wd-mod) and locally the c. 1808 Ma Mount Christine Granite (P_-SDkc-gmp). The Saunders Creek Formation has a maximum thickness of 200 m. The formation is composed of greenschist facies siliciclastic metasedimentary rocks. Lithofacies consist of metamorphosed medium- to thick-bedded, poorly sorted, abundantly trough cross-bedded, fine-grained to very coarse-grained quartz arenite, subarkose, arkose, and quartzite. Metasandstone beds are commonly interbedded with thin- to medium-bedded, poorly sorted, matrix-supported metaconglomerate. Clasts consist of subangular to rounded granules to pebbles of white vein quartz. The Saunders Creek Formation represents deposition in a high-current energy braided river system. U-Pb SHRIMP dating of detrital zircons from two metasandstone samples yielded dominant age components at c. 2512-2522 Ma with significant age components at c. 3576 and 3318 Ma (GA 87598028, Blake et al., 1999a and 08THCO03, Phillips et al., 2016). The maximum depositional age of the Saunders Creek Formation is best constrained by the youngest magmatic age from the underlying Sophie Downs Suite, which is dated at 1904 Â± 5 Ma (GSWA 206150, Kirkland et al., 2015), which is interpreted as the age of volcanism.","The Saunders Creek Formation crops out in two areas: around north-northeasterly trending basement inliers of the 1912-1904 Ma Sophie Downs Suite (P_-SO-xmg-mv) northeast of Sophie Downs Homestead (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 374524E 7988000N) and around basement rocks in the Taylor Lookout Anticline area (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 321759E 7909295N).  Northerly outcrops are exposed northeast of Sophie Downs Homestead on the flanks of three north-northeasterly trending basement inliers: the Sophie Downs Dome, Saunders Creek Dome, and Castle Creek Anticline (Blake et al., 1999, 2000; Phillips et al., 2016). The Saunders Creek Formation is exposed on the northwest and southern flanks of the Sophie Downs Dome, but pinches out to the east. The unit is well exposed around the flanks of the Saunders Creek Dome and on the western limb of the Castle Creek Anticline on HALLS CREEK and ANTRIM.  Southerly outcrops are located south of the White Quartz Hills (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 319836E 7912044N), about 3 km northwest of Taylor Lookout (Tyler et al., 1998). In this area, the Saunders Creek Formation is exposed in thin units on basement inliers of the Sophie Downs Suite. The outcrops in the Taylor Lookout area is accessible from the Old Ballara Road, which runs south off the Great Northern Highway from the Old Lamboo Homestead (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 324074E 7949296N).","The Saunders Creek Formation was named by Ruker (1961) after Saunders Creek immediately north of the Saunders Creek Dome on the Sophie Downs Station, 37 km northeast of the town of Halls Creek (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 391498E 8001726N). The type section was recorded on the western flank of the Saunders Creek Dome 2.5 km southwest of the Bullaman Rockhole on HALLS CREEK (Ruker, 1961).",,"The Saunders Creek Formation is an entirely metasedimentary siliciclastic unit, consisting of metasandstone interbedded with metaconglomerate and metasiltstone, metamorphosed to greenschist facies. Dominant lithofacies are composed of medium-bedded to thick-bedded, poorly sorted, very coarse-grained to fine-grained metasubarkose, meta-arkose, quartz arenite, and quartzite (Tyler et al., 1998; Blake et al., 1999, 2000; Phillips et al., 2016). Metasandstone beds contain abundant trough cross-bedding with lesser tabular cross-bedding, overturned cross-bedding and planar-parallel laminations. Beds are uncommonly massive or normally graded. Feldspar and quartz grains are angular to subrounded. Subangular to rounded floating quartz pebbles are common. Cross-laminations and planar-laminations are dark grey or black, aluminous metasiltstone or metamudstone with abundant heavy minerals, including magnetite, hematite, rutile, monazite, ilmenite, and zircon. Cross-laminations produce high magnetic susceptibilities of 50 &times; 10-3 to 308 &times; 10-3 SI when using a hand-held KT-10 magnetic susceptibility meter. Stacked channel bodies 3 to 9 m wide and up to 3 m deep are locally present. These channel structures generally have a massive fill or are locally normally graded. Saunders Creek Formation metasandstone beds are locally strongly silicified, which has subdued or removed many sedimentary structures, resulting in massive beds of quartz-dominated metasandstone and quartzite with uncommon rhombic and tabular pseudomorphs of hematite and quartz after feldspar.  Saunders Creek Formation metasandstone beds are commonly interbedded with discontinuous beds and lenses of metaconglomerate. Metaconglomerate units are thin- to medium-bedded, poorly sorted, matrix-supported, commonly monomictic quartz-granule and quartz-pebble metaconglomerates. Metaconglomerate units scour into underlying metasandstone beds, forming discontinuous beds, lenses, and lags. Quartz granules and pebbles are subrounded to well-rounded. Metaconglomerate matrices are composed of fine-grained and medium-grained metasubarkose or quartz arenite with cross-laminations of dark grey, aluminous metasiltstone and metamudstone. Laminations within the matrix have moderate magnetic susceptibility values (42 &times; 10-3 to 90 &times; 10-3 SI) and contain magnetite, hematite, rutile, monazite, ilmenite, and zircon.  The top of the Saunders Creek Formation is exposed on the western side of the Saunders Creek Dome. At this location, the top of the formation is noticeably finer grained than the rest of the formation, consisting of metasiltstone-dominated lithofacies that suggest that the formation, at least locally, fines upward. These lithofacies consists of thick packages of thin-bedded to medium-bedded, planar-laminated or cross-laminated, siliceous metasiltstone and sandy metasiltstone. Metasiltstone beds are heavy mineral-bearing and contain magnetite, monazite, and zircon, producing beds with moderate magnetic susceptibilities of 23 &times; 10-3 to 30 &times; 10-3 SI. Metasiltstone beds are commonly strongly cleaved. Interbedded metasandstone forms discontinuous beds and lenses up to 30 cm thick, composed of massive or planar-parallel laminated, medium-grained to coarse-grained subarkose and quartz arenite. Contacts between metasandstone and metasiltstone beds are erosive. Overturned cross-bedding is observed in some metasandstone interbeds. Metasandstone beds are commonly boudinaged. On the western flank of the Saunders Creek Dome, the Saunders Creek Formation grades into the overlying Brim Rockhole Formation.","The Saunders Creek Formation is dominated by texturally and mineralogically immature coarse-grained metasandstone and metaconglomerate. Metasandstone units are poorly sorted with angular to subrounded grains. Grain angularity and coarse grain size indicate a relatively short transport distance. Trough cross-bedding is abundant with lesser tabular cross-bedding. Overturned cross-bedding is indicative of strong bottom water currents and, together with coarse grain size, suggests high-current energy depositional settings. The Saunders Creek Formation was probably deposited in a series of braided rivers, originating from granitic and recycled sedimentary provinces.  The massive and planar-parallel laminated metasiltstone-dominated units at the top of the formation on the western flank of the Saunders Creek Dome were deposited in a more quiescent depositional setting compared to the conglomeratic lithofacies in the Saunders Creek Formation. These lithofacies could have been deposited as a result of channel avulsion. However, they are more likely to represent overbank and floodplain deposits. These lithofacies could also be lacustrine. Laminated metasiltstone beds are punctuated by medium- and coarse-grained feldspathic metasandstone or quartzite with erosive contacts, suggesting that they are the products of higher current energy events in an otherwise quiescent depositional setting. These metasandstone beds, again, suggest overbank or floodplain deposits during times of flood. These lithofacies are only found on the western flank of the Saunders Creek Dome, so the Saunders Creek Formation, at least locally, fines upward.",10,200,,"The Saunders Creek Formation unconformably overlies all formations of the 1912-1904 Ma Sophie Downs Suite (P_-SO-xmg-mv). The formation overlies the Sophie Downs Granite (P_-SOsd-mgml) with angular unconformity on the northern and southern ends of the north-northeasterly trending Sophie Downs Dome on HALLS CREEK. It unconformably overlies the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (P_-SOdd-xmb-mf) around most of the north-northeasterly trending Saunders Creek Dome and Castle Creek Anticline on HALLS CREEK and ANTRIM. At the northern tip of the Saunders Creek Dome the Saunders Creek Formation is faulted and in shear contact with the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (CXPGRD000127, HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 391587E 8001669N). At this location, the contact is marked by a brecciated zone between the coherent or fragmental basaltic rocks of the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics and thick-bedded metasandstone of the Saunders Creek Formation. The breccia is 2 to 10 m thick and consists of blocks of quartz-dominated metasandstone of the Saunders Creek Formation in a sheared mafic volcaniclastic matrix. This brecciated zone indicates a period of non-deposition and erosion between the emplacement of the volcanics and the deposition of the Halls Creek Group. The Saunders Creek Formation unconformably overlies the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics on the western limb on the Castle Creek Anticline. Around Taylor Lookout on DOCKRELL, the Saunders Creek Formation is in shear contact with the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics, Esaw Monzogranite (P_-SOes-mgml), and Junda Microgranite (P_-SOju-mgml) of the Sophie Downs Suite (Tyler et al., 1998).  The Saunders Creek Formation is conformably overlain by the Brim Rockhole Formation (P_-HCb-xmkt-mv). Metasiltstone-dominated units at the top of the Saunders Creek Formation west of Saunders Creek Dome grade into fine-grained lithofacies at the base of the overlying Brim Rockhole Formation (Phillips et al., 2016). The contact between the Saunders Creek Formation and Brim Rockhole Formation around Sophie Downs Dome is sharp with feldspathic metasandstones conformably underlying siliciclastic metasandstone and intercalated metabasalt.  The Saunders Creek Formation is intruded by sills of the c. 1835 Ma Woodward Dolerite (P_-_wd-mod), most notably around the Castle Creek Anticline on ANTRIM and HALLS CREEK. The formation is intruded by the c. 1788 Ma Mount Christine Granite (P_-SDkc-gmp) at the Taylor Lookout (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 321790E 7909241E).",,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,1904,,1881,,"Two metasandstone samples from the Saunders Creek Formation have been analyzed by SHRIMP U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology. Both samples were collected from the northern end of the Saunders Creek Dome on HALLS CREEK. Sample GA 87598028 (Blake et al., 1999), a quartz metasandstone, contains detrital zircons with a dominant age component at c. 2512 Ma and significant age components at c. 3318 and 3576 Ma (Blake et al., 1999; Phillips et al., 2016). Detrital zircons from sample 08TKHCO03 (Phillips et al., 2016), a quartzite, have a dominant age component at c. 2522 Ma with minor components at 3634-2501 Ma (Phillips et al., 2016). Maximum depositional ages of the Saunders Creek Formation are provided by two detrital samples with weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* dates of 2515 Â± 8 Ma and 2508 Â± 8 Ma (GA 87598028 and 08TKHCO03, respectively).  The maximum age of the Saunders Creek Formation is best constrained by the unconformably underlying Ding Dong Downs Volcanics of the Sophie Downs Suite. A mylonitized quartzofeldspathic rock from the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics yielded a mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1904 Â± 5 Ma, which is interpreted as the age of the volcanic protolith (GSWA 206150, Kirkland et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2016). A minimum depositional age is constrained by a fragmental felsic metavolcanic rock in the conformably overlying Brim Rockhole Formation, which yields a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1881 Â± 4 Ma, which is interpreted as the age of volcanism (GA 93526012, Blake et al., 1999; Phillips et al., 2016). These age data indicate that fluvial rocks of the Saunders Creek Formation were deposited between c. 1904 and 1881 Ma from Neoarchean magmatic sources, subsequently recycled multiple times.

3798,16679,P_-MS-skcv,3759,Scorpion Group,1,"Evaporitic and stromatolitic dolomite, and sandstone; lesser siltstone","The Scorpion Group consists of evaporitic dolomite, and mixed sandy and silty siliciclastic rocks. The group was deposited in a northward-deepening coastal setting, sourced from adjacent areas to the south based on paleocurrent data and facies trends. Three formations are recognized, the Wonyulgunna Sandstone (sandstone, minor conglomerate; base), the Willy Willy Formation (dolomite and siltstone) and the Millury Formation (mixed sandstone, siltstone and conglomerate; top). The pattern of outcrop suggests that there is a major evaporitic diapir (now collapsed because of salt solution and withdrawal) in the central part of the graben occupied by the group at the stratigraphic level of the Willy Willy Formation. The eastern margin of the diaper has been truncated by faulting. Based on structure contours, the group could be as much as 10 km thick. Stromatolites in the Willy Willy Formation have not been examined in detail, but are broadly similar to those in the lower Edmund Group. Its age is therefore inferred to be that of the lower Edmund Group, although the maximum age is further constrained by the age of metamorphic micas (1650 Ma) in dynamically metamorphosed Tooloo Group and Frere Formation, clasts of which have been reworked into Scorpion Group adjacent to its southern faulted margin. The Scorpion Group's minimum age is probably that of Depositional package 1 of the Edmund Group (1610 Ma) but it could be as young as the youngest Edmund Group (1455 Ma). ","The Scorpion Group is preserved primarily in a graben straddling the Canning Stock Route between CSR Wells 7 and 8 on RHODES (Pirajno and Hocking, 2000). The basal unit, the Wonyulgunna Sandstone, forms the sandstone ranges extending west from the graben to the Ingebong Hills, then through Mount Salvado to the Carnarvon Ranges on METHWIN (Hocking and Jones, 1999), and thence northwest through Mount Methwin and the Yibbie Range (Trainor 1:250 000 sheet) to Wonyulgunna Hill on WONYULGUNNA (Thorne and Blay, 2017). The combined stratigraphic thickness of the group could be as much as 10 km, based on structure contours across the graben. It presumably extends northwards beneath the late Mesoproterozoic Salvation Group and Neoproterozoic - Cambrian northwest Officer Basin.","The Scorpion Group was initially named, as the Scorpion Subgroup of the Bangemall Group, by Brakel and Leech (1979) after Scorpion Well on Glen Ayle station. No consituent formations were defined. Hocking et al. (2000) raised the unit to group status, and Hocking et al. (2003) displayed the constituent formations, in part newly named, on Nabberu 1:250 000 sheet. The Wonyulgunna Sandstone had previously been assigned to the basal Collier Group in the eastern Capricorn Orogen, but remapping of the Scorpion Diapir and follow-up fieldwork indicated it is actually the basal unit of the Scorpion Group. ",,"The Scorpion Group consists of a lower thick extensive sandstone blanket, the Wonyulgunna Sandstone, transitionally overlain by a mixed carbonate, siltstone, sandstone and formerly evaporitic unit (Willy Willy Formation), capped in turn by a interbedded sandstone and siltstone unit, the Millury Formation.  The Wonyulgunna Sandstone is dominated by medium- to coarse-grained, moderately silicified, variably sorted quartz arenite. It is generally trough cross-bedded, but significant horizontally bedded facies are present. Paleocurrent flow was towards the north and east, indicating a provenance from the Mary Mia Inlier, northern Yilgarn Craton, and adjacent Paleoproterozoic sedimentary rocks. A giant cross-bedded facies is present near the base, and is interpreted as a major fluvial to coastal distributary deposit. Horizontally bedded and rippled sandstone increases upwards and eastwards, in a transition from sheet-braided to tidal sandflat deposition. Conglomerate horizons are present at the base of the Wonyulgunna Sandstone, and as discontinuous lenses and sheets at higher levels.  The Willy Willy Formation consists of stromatolitic limestone and siltstone, soft grey siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone. The siltstone is generally recessive, and individual separate stromatolite domes are common within it at some levels. Microbial intraclast breccia forms the cores of some stromatolites, and extends between domes in places. Sandstone is present as laterally persistent beds generally less than a metre thick. Limestone beds show enterolithic deformation and medium- to large-scale cauliflower-like deformation, and small halite pseudomorphs and salt hoppers are present but not common in sandstone beds. The pattern of outcrop in the central part of the graben occupied by the group is indicative of a major evaporitic diaper at the level of the Willy Willy Formation, now collapsed because of salt solution and withdrawal.   The Millury Formation grades out of the Willy Willy Formation, and consists of interbedded sandstone, generally fine grained, siltstone, and upward-decreasing carbonate. Conglomerates are present adjoining the faulted southern margin of the main Scorpion Group graben, with cobble- to small boulder-sized clasts derived in part from the Tooloo Group and Frere Formation on the southern side of the fault. ","The Scorpion Group is characterized by the basal transgressive sandstone sheet of the Wonyulgunna Sandstone, followed by evaporitic coastal to nearshore marine deposition in the Willy Willy Formation, and returning to coastal to nearshore siliciclastic deposition in the Millury Formation. The basin deepened northwards, with a source region extending from the Marymia Inlier southeastwards and eastwards across the northern Yilgarn Craton. The Marymia Inlier may have formed a mid-basin high separating the Scorpion Basin from the lower Edmund Basin to the west.",300,10000,,"The Scorpion Group is angularly unconformable on the Frere Formation and Tooloo Group. The basal part of the group and the lower Wonyulgiunna Sandstone commonly contain reworked clasts of Frere Formation and Tooloo Group, ranging from pebbles to well-rounded cobbles and small boulders.  The contact with the Salvation is everywhere obscured by Cenozoic sand, but can be assumed to be disconformable based on known geochronological constraints. It can be difficult to place locally as both are sandstone-rich groups deposited in similar settings.",,17,,,,2,,,,1653,,1455,,"The Scorpion Group is tentatively correlated with the lower Edmund Group of the Bangemall Supergroup on the basis of gross similarities of stromatolites in the Scorpion Group to those in the lower Edmund Group.

The Scotty Creek Formation was deposited in a braided river setting within a narrow north-northeast trending basin, and rests unconformably over greenstones of the Kalgoorlie and Mount White Groups.

Although mylonitized in the western limb of the Scotty Creek Syncline, sedimentary structures are well preserved in the eastern limb. They include current ripples and tangential and trough cross bedding, which typically indicate younging direction to the west (Beardsmore, 2002).

Scotty Creek sandstones were laid down in a narrow but elongate, north-northeasterly trending basin on the western flank of the Lawlers Anticline and Mount White Syncline. Blewett et al. (2010) and Squire et al. (2010) interpret the Scotty Creek Formation as a late-basin succession but R.

In some instances the granite does not contain any biotite, but instead contains abundant muscovite. The sheets are easterly trending. The unit commonly outcrops as whalebacks and tors. The Scrubber Granite is typically massive, but locally well foliated.  Nodules of tourmaline and quartz are characteristic of the Scrubber Granite, although they are not common on GLENBURGH. West of GLENBURGH, on DAURIE CREEK, individual isolated and loosely interconnected nodules of tourmaline-quartz are very common within the Scrubber Granite.

The nodules are composed of tourmaline and quartz, each making up about 45% of the nodule with minor amounts of plagioclase and K-feldspar. The tourmaline replaces both feldspar and biotite, apparently pseudomorphing these minerals where the nodules are best developed. In places, smaller tourmaline crystals are scattered through the groundmass of the Scrubber Granite; the timing of their  crystallization relative to the igneous minerals in the groundmass is uncertain. Texturally, the clusters are medium grained and equigranular like their host granite; however, feldspar and biotite are either not present or only form rare components.

The northern limit of the basin is at the southern tip of the Siberia Monzogranite (DAVYHURST map sheet), extending southwards to an area between Lake Douglas and Red Lake on the southwest corner of KALGOORLIE. Regionally the unit is poorly exposed, but is well exposed in the Seven Mile Quarry 13.7 km southwest of Kalgoorlie township.","The name is derived from the Seven Mile Hill Quarry (zone 51, MGA 344830E, 6586300N).",,"The member is a poorly exposed quartzfeldspathic sandstone with a thickness of approximately 1290-1300m (Hunter 1993; KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2008). Rare outcrops reveal thin- to medium-bedded quartz-rich sandstones with normal grading. Less common are siltstone, black shale and sandstones with a pebble lag. KrapeÅ¾ et al. (2008) briefly describe four lithofacies that include: a) massive medium grained sandstone with a tabular geometry; b) plane-bedded, medium-grained sandstone with tabular geometry; c) rare trough cross-bedded sandstone and; d) very rare fine-grained planar- to cross-laminated sandstone. Sedimentary structures include planar and tough cross-bedding, and flame and ball-and-pillow structures where mudstones are present.    Hunter (1993) describes the sandstone as moderately to well sorted, but immature, and contains subangular to subrounded detritus. Fragments of felsic volcanic rocks, quartzite, siltstone, and shale constitute the dominant lithic clast population. They are accompanied by clastic plagioclase and minor K-feldspar, both of which are sericitized. In both the clasts and the matrix, metamorphic biotite, white mica, and opaques are abundant and are associated with epidote, chlorite, and albite. Quartz exhibits complex grain-boundary recrystallization.","Krapez et al (2008) interpreted the depositional setting as a proximal south-east orientated submarine canyon feed by a fluvial system from a source west of the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane. Alternatively, Hunter (1993) compares the greater sorting and grading in the sandstone with the underlying conglomerate unit and suggests either deposition as a distal facies of an alluvial fan system, or a subaqueous environment with the fan prograding to a braided-river system or fan delta.",,1300,,"From the underlying Lake Douglas Conglomerate Member there is a broad, gradational, fining-upwards sequence of pebbly conglomerates, pebbly sandstones and intercalated sandstones into the massive to planar bedded sandstone. The transition zone is approximately 20 m thick (Hunter, 1993). There are no younger formations preserved above the Seven Mile Sandstone Member. The only intrusive relationship, inferred from aeromagnetic images is thought to be with mafic dykes of the Paleoproterozoic Widgiemooltha Dolerite.",,17,,,,5,,,,2657,,2640,,"KrapeÅ¾ et al. (2000) analysed three samples from the Kurrawang Formation for SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages. Two samples were from sandstones intercalated with the Lake Douglas Conglomerate Member, while a third sample (KU-3) was from the Seven Mile Sandstone Member. Results from all three samples yielded a range of U-Pb SHRIMP zircon ages, with the oldest age at 3567 Â± 5 Ma. From sample KU-3, KrapeÅ¾ et al. (2000) defined 5 age distributions, with a large age grouping at 2666 Â± 5 Ma. By correlating age dates from felsic intrusions, and folding of the Kurrawang Formation by D2 (after Swager, 1997) KrapeÅ¾ et al (2000) suggested that the maximum age for the formation must be &le; 2655Ma.  Squires et al. (2010) used LA-ICP-MS techniques to analyse multiple zircons extracted from a quartz-rich sedimentary unit from the Seven Mile Hill quarry. The data yielded a significant range in ages from 3576 Â± 36 Ma, to less than 2600 Ma. From their data they inferred a minimum age to be c. 2655 Ma by correlating structural fabrics, and metamorphic grade of the formation to regional geotectonic models (Goscombe et al., 2009; Blewett et al., 2010). Furthermore, figures 5 and 13 from Squire et al., (2010) schematically show the depositional age range of the Kurrawang Group (includes Kurrawang Formation) between ~2658-2655 Ma. This interpretation does, in part, conflict with the maximum depositional age of the underlying Navajo Sandstone which is given as <2657 Â±4 Ma (Fletcher et al., 2001).

It unconformably overlies the Turee Creek and Hamersley Groups and is itself either unconformably overlain by the Mount McGrath Formation (Wyloo Group), or conformably to disconformably overlain by the Wooly Dolomite. The Shingle Creek Group is subdivided into two formations, the Beasley River Quartzite and the overlying Cheela Springs Basalt. The Beasley River Quartzite is composed of fine- to coarse-grained, silicified quartz sandstone, together with lesser amounts of ferruginous conglomerate, sandstone and pebbly sandstone, and non-ferruginous siltstone and dolomite. These rocks were deposited in alluvial fan, fluvial, eolian, tidal shoreline, and offshore environments. The Cheela Springs Basalt consists of amygdalaoidal basalt and minor volcaniclastic rock, together with immature sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone; and was laid down in a coastal to deep-marine shelf setting. The Shingle Creek Group has an age of c. 2208 Ma and is intruded by sills of the Balgara Dolerite (P_-_bg-od).","The Shingle Creek Group is exposed on MOUNT STUART, WYLOO, HARDEY, ROCKLEA, ASHBURTON, PARABURDOO, SNOWY MOUNT, KALLENIA, and PRAIRIE DOWNS. The most complete section is preserved near Shingle Creek (Zone 50, MGA 486200E 7469000N) on southeastern HARDEY, where the succession is ~3290 m thick.","The Shingle Creek Group comprises two formations, the Beasley River Quartzite and the overlying Cheela Springs Basalt. Both units had formerly been assigned to the lower part of the Wyloo Group, although the Cheela Springs Basalt was initially defined as a member within the Mount McGrath Formation (MacLeod et al., 1963; Halligan and Daniels, 1964, Trendall, 1979). Subsequently, Horwitz (1980) recognized a regional disconformity at the top of the Cheela Springs Basalt Member and removed these rocks from the Mount McGrath Formation, while at the same time upgrading them to the level of formation.  Although the disconformity at the top of the Cheela Springs Basalt was recognized by various workers (Horwitz, 1980; Seymour et al., 1988; Thorne and Seymour, 1991), its temporal significance was unknown and did not lead to a redefinition of the Wyloo Group. More recently a c. 2208 Ma mafic magmatic event, responsible for deposition of the Cheela Springs Basalt and coeval dolerite intrusion into the Beasley River Quartzite and underlying Turee Creek Group has been identified and provides a reliable age for the lower part of the Wyloo Group (Martin et al., 1998; M&uuml;ller et al., 2005; Martin and Morris, 2010). In contrast, the maximum age of the upper Wyloo Group is fixed by ages of c. 2030 Ma and c. 2008 Ma that were published for the Wooly Dolomite and for dolerite dykes that post-date the lower Wyloo Group but pre-date the Mount McGrath Formation (M&uuml;ller et al., 2005). These data show that a hiatus of at least 200 Ma occurred between deposition of the lower and upper parts of the Wyloo Group. This in turn has led to a revision of the Wyloo Group, with the lower Wyloo Group (Beasley River Quartzite, Cheela Springs Basalt) now being assigned to the Shingle Creek Group, and the upper Wyloo Group (Mount McGrath Formation, Duck Creek Dolomite, June Hill Volcanics, and Ashburton Formation) being retained within the revised Wyloo Group. The c. 2030 Ma age for the Wooly Dolomite indicates that this unit was laid down in the interval between deposition of the Shingle Creek and Wyloo Groups.  The Shingle Creek Group is named after Shingle Creek, a signposted watercourse that crosses the Nanutarra - Tom Price road at Zone 50, MGA 485350E 7468070N on southeastern HARDEY. Martin et al. (2000) proposed a type section for the Cheela Springs Basalt at Shingle Creek, whereas the type section for the Beasley River Quartzite is located at Zone 50, MGA 461990E 7480720N on the western part of HARDEY (Trendall, 1979).",,"The Shingle Creek Group is composed of basalt and mafic volcaniclastic rock, together with sandstone, conglomerate, pebbly sandstone, siltstone, and minor dolomite. Parts of the succession are intruded by dolerite sills. The succession is divided into two formations, the Beasley River Quartzite (P_-SKqt-stq) and the overlying Cheela Springs Basalt (P_-SKb-bb).  The Beasley River Quartzite is composed of fine- to coarse-grained, silicified quartz sandstone, together with lesser amounts of ferruginous conglomerate, sandstone and pebbly sandstone, and non-ferruginous siltstone and dolomite. The thickest section of ferruginous conglomerate and pebbly sandstone is at the base of the formation, near the southeastern closure of the Wyloo Dome, and has been named the Three Corner Conglomerate Member (P_-SKqt-sc; Trendall, 1979).  The Cheela Springs Basalt is composed of amygdaloidal basalt and minor volcaniclastic rock, together with immature sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone. Significant amounts of sedimentary rock and intercalated basalt near the base of the formation have been recorded as a separate unit, the Nummana Member (P_-SKbn-xs-b).","The lower part of the Shingle Creek Group (Beasley River Quartzite) is interpreted as a mixed association of alluvial fan, fluvial, eolian, tidal shoreline, and offshore deposits (Thorne and Seymour, 1991; Martin et al., 2000; Mazumder and Van Kranendonk, 2013). Much of the overlying Cheela Springs Basalt was laid down in a coastal to shallow-marine setting (Thorne and Seymour, 1991), although upper parts of the formation were probably deposited below wave base and indicate a change to deeper marine conditions with time (M&uuml;ller, 2005).  Deposition of the Shingle Creek Group, and the underlying Turee Creek Group and uppermost Hamersley Group (Boolgeeda Iron Formation), took place during the early foreland-basin stage of the 2215-2145 Ma Ophthalmia Orogeny, when the Pilbara Craton collided with a continent to the south (Blake and Barley, 1992; Martin et al., 2000; Rasmussen et al., 2005). Recent evidence suggests that this southern continent was the Glenburgh Terrane of the Gascoyne Province (Martin et al., 2000; Occhipinti et al., 2004; Sheppard et al., 2004, 2010; Martin and Morris, 2010; Johnson et al., 2010, 2011). An alternative view was put forward by KrapeÅ¾ (1999), who considered the Shingle Creek Group stratigraphy to record the opening stage of an Atlantic-type ocean.",,3290,,"The Shingle Creek Group unconformably overlies the Turee Creek Group, with the following exceptions: around Zone 50, MGA 644100E 7403100N on SNOWY MOUNT; Zone 50, MGA 742540E 7363000N on PRAIRIE DOWNS; south and northwest of the Paraburdoo iron ore mine on PARABURDOO and ASHBURTON; along the southern and northern margins of the Wyloo Dome on WYLOO and HARDEY. At these locations, it unconformably overlies the Hamersley Group. The group generally has an unconformable upper contact with the Mount McGrath Formation (Wyloo Group), apart from on the southeastern flank of the Wyloo Dome, north of the dome, and southeast of Mount Maguire where it has a conformable to erosional upper contact with the Wooly Dolomite. The Shingle Creek Group is intruded by dolerite sills of the c. 2208 Ma Balgara Dolerite (P_-_bg-od).",,17,,,Mixed,2,,,,2208,,2031,,"The depositional age of the Shingle Creek Group is close to c. 2208 Ma. This is based primarily on the age of dolerite sills that intrude both this succession and the unconformably underlying Turee Creek Group. The age is also supported by data from the Cheela Springs Basalt in the upper part of the Shingle Creek Group. Since there are no age determinations from the top of the group, which is locally in conformable contact with the Wooly Dolomite, a conservative minimum age is provided by the U-Pb zircon SHRIMP date of 2031 Â± 6 Ma (M&uuml;ller et al., 2005) obtained from a felsic volcaniclastic horizon towards the base of the dolomitic unit. The U-Pb zircon age of 2446 Â± 8 Ma obtained from a zircon population in a sandstone sample from the Beasley River Quartzite (lower Shingle Creek Group) is a maximum depositional age only and records the age of the Hamersley Group source rocks (GSWA 169084, Nelson, 2004).   M&uuml;ller et al. (2005) obtained two separate U-Pb baddeleyite SHRIMP ages of 2208 Â± 10 Ma, one from a dolerite sill that intrudes the Beasley River Quartzite in the Turee Creek Syncline (Martin and Morris, 2010), and another from a sill that intrudes the Turee Creek Group and is truncated by the unconformity at the base of the Beasley River Quartzite in the Hardey Syncline. In addition, Martin et al. (1998) reported an age of 2209 Â± 15 Ma from a poorly bedded volcaniclastic breccia in the upper part of the Cheela Springs Basalt. Although this age determination is strictly a maximum age, it was interpreted by these authors as being close to the true age of deposition. Taken together, these age determinations and field relationships point to a dynamic history of sedimentation, mafic magmatism, and deformation during the early stages of the 2215-2145 Ma Ophthalmia Orogeny (Rasmussen et al., 2005; Martin and Morris, 2010).",No,,,726,,No,Published,Yes,Yes,P_,SK,,13,32,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,No,No

The member comprises multiple flows 10- ~100 metres thick of komatiitic peridotite, with cumulate bases and upper spinifex zones. Sulfidic nickel-rich ore bodies and very fine-grained carbonaceous to albitic metasedimentary rocks are intercalated with the flows. The nickel sulfide ore bodies are mainly restricted to the base of the lowermost channel facies and constitute 80% of the resources and forms tabular to ribbon-like linear oreshoots.   Two prominent facies have been identified as: (a) channel flow facies (focussed flow, ore environment) dominated by olivine mesocumulate and orthocumulate zones and thinner olivine spinifex-textured and pyroxene spinifex-textured zones, and (b) sheet flow or flanking flow facies (unfocussed flow and non-ore environment). Flows of this facies are thinner (<30 m), less magnesium rich (12-21wt% MgO), and are predominantly olivine- and pyroxene spinifex-textured zones to pyroxene- and olivine-phyric zones.  ","The member is distributed around the doubly plunging Kambalda Anticline, on the LAKE LEFROY map sheet, in the Kalgoorlie Terrane.","Derivation of the name is unknown.  AXR comment, August 2016: there is no official Silver Lake locality in WA, but the ASUD states that a Silver Lake Peridotite was mentioned in Clark et al (1986) p244, and other refs. The reference is not provided; the name was reserved by Archibakd and Cowden in December 1986. NB also the additional Stone reference from Journal of Structural Geology",,"In the Kambalda Dome area, the Kambalda Komatiite Formation has been subdivided into two units. The lowermost unit, called the Silver Lake Member (SLM), is a komatiitic peridotite (50-200m thick) with multiple flow units (up to 24 flows, Beresford et al., 2002) 10 m to ~100 m-thick. Magnesium values are high (e.g. 36 wt % MgO). The member is intercalated by fine-grained siliciclastic metasedimentary units and Ni-Sulfide ore zones, particularly at the contact with the underlying Lunnon Basalt. This unit occupies the lower third of the Kambalda Komatiite Formation, and flows are characteristically topped by a spinifex texture that may grade up into an aphyritic komatiite with internal fracturing. The bases of the flows are typically cumulate, with up to 48 weight % MgO. Autobrecciated flow tops are rare in the Kambalda region (Beresford et al, 2002). In the Lunnon Shoot at Kambalda there is a thick (<25m) spinifex-textured picrite, and this was referred to as the Lunnon Picrite by Ross and Hopkins (1975).   Lesher and Arndt (1995) defined two volcanic facies within the Silver Lake Member: (1) A channel flow facies (focussed flow, ore environment). This facies dominated by olivine mesocumulate and orthocumulate zones and thinner olivine spinifex-textured and pyroxene spinifex-textured zones. The flows are 30- ~100 m thick with 16-31% wt% MgO. Stone (1997) reports that the channel flow facies occupies topographical depressions in the underlying Lunnon Basalt, and some units have been traced along a north northwest strike for up to 15km , and 500m wide. Many ore shoots at the base of the member are in contact with sulphidic fine-grained sedimentary rocks. (2) A sheet flow or flanking flow facies (unfocussed flow and non-ore environment). Flows of this facies are <30m thick, less magnesium rich (12-21wt% MgO), and are predominantly olivine- and pyroxene spinifex-textured zones to pyroxene- and olivine-phyric zones. Unlike the channel flow facies, the sheet flow facies lack the nickel-Sulfide mineralization but do have intercalated sulphidic sedimentary units (Bavinton, 1979).   Beresford et al, (2002) identified three representative end member flow types in the basal komatiite flow at the Victor shoot in Kambalda The most common end member flow (Type I) has the classical aphyritic top progressing downwards to the A (spinifex) and B (cumulate) zonation. Types II and III, have more complex B-zones, with Type II displaying multiple cumulate layers and crescumulate to skeletal units. Type III flows are typified by extreme differentiation in very thick units (max. 150m) and an absence of mineralization. Nickel-Sulfide mineralization was generally restricted to Type II (Beresford et al., 2002).   Beresford &amp; Stone (2004) summarized the nickel sulfide deposits in the Kambalda area as being mainly restricted to the base of the lowermost channel facies flow (termed contact ore) and, more rarely, to the base of overlying flows (termed hangingwall ore) and in crosscutting structures as offset ore (Gresham and Loftus-Hills, 1981). Contact ore constitutes 80% of the resources and forms tabular to ribbon-like linear oreshoots up to 2500 m long, 300 m wide, generally <5 m thick, and <0.6 to about 10 Mt in size (Marston and Kay, 1980). Individual sulfide orebodies comprising pyrrhotite-pentlandite- pyrite-chalcopyrite are zoned, with a layer of massive sulfide, up to 2 m thick, at the base overlain in sequence by matrix sulfide to 2 m thick, then disseminated sulfide.    CO2 metasomatism and regional metamorphism/deformation has resulted in extensive alteration of the member. At low to medium greenschist facies serpentinized assemblages of more magnesium-rich units commonly include antigorite-lizardite-brucite and minor carbonate, chlorite and magnetite. Primary olivine is rarely preserved. At upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies metamorphic olivine is produced by either the breakdown of serpentine minerals, or from the reaction between talc and dolomite and/or magnesite. Other minerals at amphibolite facies grade include talc, tremolite and chlorite, and depending on the original mineralogy of the rock can include anthophyllite, cummingtonite and relict chromite. Although alteration can be extensive there is often good preservation of spinifex-textures at the outcrop scale. There is poorer preservation of cumulate textures in the field, but this texture can be identified in thin section, particularly where fine, secondary opaque minerals have formed around the crystal margins, and or clays have infilled the groundmass in meso- and orthocumulate rocks.   Bavinton (1979, 1981) undertook a comprehensive study of metasedimentary rocks found at the base of the komatiite and within the body an ultramafic at Kambalda. Griffin (1990) summarized Bavinton s work as follows: Thin metasedimentary horizons (< 5 m) are present on the contact between ultramafic rocks and the Lunnon Basalt (Kambalda footwall basalt), and between some flows in the lower part of the metakomatiite-dominated unit. The three main types present have been described in detail by Bavinton (1979, 1981). The cherty and dark carbonaceous types are composed mainly of quartz and albite, and contain 15 to 20% pyrrhotite and pyrite. Alternating bands of sulphidic and cherty material make up some horizons. The less common chloritic metasedimentary rocks have small amounts of quartz and albite, but consist mainly of chlorite, biotite, tremolite, pyrrhotite and pyrite. These chloritic rocks are more common towards the ore environment. They may be stratigraphically equivalent to the cherty types (Bavinton, 1981). A massive, siliceous, albitic and variolitic zone occurs at the base of some interflow metasediments. The sediments are from mixed sources including both felsic and mafic-ultramafic volcanics, and an exhalative component which contributed sulphur (Bavinton, 1981). The ocelli or varioles are similar to those common in many metamorphosed high-Mg basalts and may result from trapped immiscible sodium-rich and volatile-rich liquids from the underlying ultramafic flow (Bavinton, 1981). ",,,200,,"The lower contact is with the Lunnon Basalt and is generally concordant. In some cases a thin, very fine-grained siliceous sedimentary unit can be found between Lunnon Basalt and the SLM. Barnes (2000) has suggested that the apparent topographical low in the basalt, at the base of the SLM, has been caused by thermal erosion by turbulent flows of the superheated komatiite flows.",,17,,,Mixed,5,,,,2709,4,2692,4,"An age magmatic crystallisation of the SLM has not been acquired due to the geochemistry/mineralogy of the unit being non-conducive to the formation of minerals suitable for isotopic dating methods. The age of the SLM has been inferred from SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages of sedimentary units between flows of the ultramafic rocks and above the Kambalda Komatiite.  The minimum age is 2692 Â± 4 Ma. This is the age of the Kapai Slate, a metasedimentary unit above the Kambalda Komatiite and Devon Consols Basalt. The age is considered to be a magmatic age reflecting contemporaneous felsic volcanism during sedimentation of the mudstone (Claou&eacute;-Long et al., 1988).   An internal report for Western Mining Corporation by W. Stone (1997) reports on high precision zircon geochronology results done by with J. Claou&eacute;-Long (unpublished). In particular, a mean U-Pb SHRIMP age of 2709 Â± 4 Ma is reported for zircons with &ldquo;igneous interiors&rdquo; extracted from an interflow sedimentary unit at the top of the lowermost komatiite flow in the Kambalda Komatiite (Silver lake Member) near the Kambalda Dome. As the zircons are from a sedimentary unit two interpretations can be applied to the age of c. 2709 Ma. The first interpretation is that the zircons are record penecontemporaneous volcanism during a hiatus in komatiite extrusion and therefore indicates an approximate initiation of ultramafic magmatism. Alternatively, the zircons are possibly detrital providing a maximum age of deposition for the sediment.

It is restricted to the Western Australian (WA) part of the Amadeus Basin. The formation forms prominent hills and ridges covered by loose cobbles and boulders due to the common breakdown of the matrix at the surface. The typically well-rounded cobbles and boulders are mostly composed of siliceous sedimentary and metasedimentary clasts (silicified sandstone, quartzite, metasandstone) that were apparently derived from the basal Amadeus Basin succession (particularly Dean Quartzite and Kulail Sandstone) and underlying units (Tjauwata Group) now exposed along the southern margin of the Amadeus Basin. Interbeds of sandstone are present locally. In the Mu Hills a lenticular unit of very recessive red-brown, poorly-sorted, lithic sandstone is locally present in the middle of the formation (Haines et al., 2015).  The Sir Frederick Conglomerate was deposited by high-energy alluvial fans synchronously with the 580-520 Ma Petermann Orogeny. The age of deposition could thus range from late Ediacaran to early Cambrian. Although thick (estimated up to 2000 m in the Sir Frederick Range), the Sir Frederick Conglomerate is restricted to local depocentres, possibly controlled by salt movement during the orogeny. It is the approximate lateral equivalent of the thinner but more widespread Ellis Sandstone (Wells et al., 1964), although the relationships between these units are not well exposed (Haines et al., 2012, 2015).     ","The Sir Frederick Conglomerate is restricted to the northern RAWLINSON and southeast corner of the MACDONALD 1:250 000 scale map sheet areas in the western Amadeus Basin in WA. Outcrops occur in the Sir Frederick Range, Mu Hills, Searle Hills, Gillespie Hills and Crockett Range. It appears that outcrops in the east (Sir Frederick Range and Mu Hills) were not continuous with the western outcrops, but were deposited in separate depocentres. At its thickest, the Sir Frederick Conglomerate is estimated to be up to 2000 m thick in the Sir Frederick Range (Haines et al., 2015).","The Sir Frederick Conglomerate was named by Wells et al. (1961, 1964), but no type area was nominated. The unit was named after Sir Frederick Range straddling the border between MACDONALD and RAWLINSON 1:250 000 scale map sheet areas.",,"The Sir Frederick Conglomerate is predominantly composed of massive conglomerate with local lenticular units of sandstone. Clasts range from pebble- to boulder-size, and are mostly well-rounded. Wells et al. (1964) report that the largest boulder clasts, up to 106 cm diameter, are found in the Gillespie Hills (northwest RAWLINSON 1:250 000 scale map sheet). Boulder clasts up to 85 cm diameter were observed further north in the Searle Hills (PWHSRL000005; MGA zone 52 382544E 7338756N), and up to 80 cm diameter in the Mu Hills (PWHMUH000016; MGA zone 52 471572E 7353328N). The clasts are dominated by well-silicified sandstone, metasandstone and quartzite. Clasts of chert (silicified carbonate) and vein quartz are a minor component, and are typically smaller than the siliciclastic clasts. Wells et al. (1964) also report minor clasts of quartz-mica schist. At one locality in the Mu Hills where the sandstone matrix is preserved (PWHMUH000016; MGA zone 52 471572E 7353328N), the deeply weathered cobble-sized relics of granitic or gneissic clasts were observed. It is possible that such clasts are more widely represented in the conglomerate at depth, but are typically destroyed by weathering at surface. Due to the generally friable nature of the sandy matrix, most outcrops consist of loose cobbles and boulders that have weathered out of the matrix. In such cases it is difficult or impossible to determine the orientation of bedding. Where the sandstone matrix is preserved, it is typically composed of white to pale brown medium-grained sandstone. At such outcrops the conglomerate is typically shown to be clast-supported, but may contain thin interbeds of sandstone or pebbly sandstone. Clast-support is also demonstrated by the common presence of pressure-solution pits on clasts surfaces where the matrix has been removed. In the Mu Hills (southeastern MACDONALD 1:250 000 map sheet area) the Sir Frederick Conglomerate is represented by lower and upper units of conglomerate, typically expressed as strike ridges, separated by a very recessive unit that is mostly sand covered. From limited outcrop, such as that around PWHMUH000116 (MGA Zone 52 470636E 7353379N) the recessive unit appears to be mainly comprised of red-brown, medium-grained, friable, lithic sandstone and pebbly sandstone (superficially resembling Carnegie Formation). Although the recessive unit is estimated to be up to 800 m thick in this area, it lenses out within 12 km to the south, and also thins to the northeast. ","The Sir Frederick Conglomerate was deposited in local depocentres by high-energy streams in an alluvial setting, possibly as fans. The sandstone facies has been deposited by lower energy fluvial processes. The localization of depocentres is likely related to salt movements (salt in the Bitter Springs Group) during the Petermann Orogeny (Haines et al., 2015). Although there is no reliable paleocurrent data, the main flow direction was probably from south to north as indicated by the apparent provenance and clast size distribution (Wells et al., 1964; Haines et al., 2015).",,2000,,"The Sir Frederick Conglomerate overlies the Carnegie Formation, although the actual contact is not well exposed and thus the relationship is unclear. Wells et al. (1964) assumed an unconformable contact, although this is likely because of the then assumed large time break between the formations, which is no longer relevant.  It is overlain by the Maurice Formation, but once again the contact is not well exposed. Wells et al. (1964) indicate that the Sir Frederick Conglomerate interfingers with the Ellis Sandstone, however this relationship is poorly exposed. The Mu Formation locally overlies the Sir Frederick Conglomerate with a pronounced angular unconformity in the northern Mu Hills (Haines et al., 2015).",,17,,,,4,,,,635,,510,,"Wingate et al. (2014) and Haines et al. (2015, 2016) present the results of detrital zircon analysis of a sandstone unit within the Sir Frederick Conglomerate in the Mu Hills (GSWA 199418). The youngest zircon, with an age of 1059 Â± 57 Ma (1&sigma;), provides a maximum depositional age for the unit, but this is much older than the age implied by other constraints. The detrital zircon age spectra is consistent with deposition during the 580-520 Ma Petermann Orogeny (Haines et al., 2015, 2016).

(1961, 1964). Haines et al. (2012) notes that the relationship between these unts is not entirely clear due to poor exposure in the localities they visited. In some sections Sir Frederick Conglomerate overlies Ellis Sandstone, and in others it underlies it. In the Mu Hills two conglomerate units are seperated by  a recessive sandstone unit that does not resemble the Ellis Sandstone. More work is needed to fully elucidate the stratigraphy, and it is likely that several discrete conglomerate bodies of somewhat different age have been mapped as Sir Fredrick Conglomerate.

The lower part of the formation in the north of the eastern limb of the Lawlers Anticline, close to the fold hinge, is mainly composed of pyroxene and plagioclase (A-_sf-bs). The pyroxene has been extensively replaced by actinolite and the plagioclase by zoisite and epidote (Beardsmore, 2002). This pyroxene-rich component is typical of the Songvang Formation in the Leinster Anticline.

The granophyric granite is composed of irregular grains of microperthite and quartz, commonly forming graphic intergrowths. Microcline encloses a few laths of sodic plagioclase. Green biotite appears in clusters of decussate flakes. Accessory minerals include fine-grained iron oxides and zircon (Gemuts, 1971). Blake et al. (1999) described the Sophie Downs Granite as mainly massive leucocratic granite and granophyre. The formation contains abundant small phenocrysts of euhedral microcline, albite, and quartz. Small mafic clots are present, rich in fine-grained biotite. The matrix is very fine-grained or fine-grained with micrographic intergrowths of quartz and alkali feldspar (Blake et al., 1999).",The Sophie Downs Granite is dominantly an intrusive body but may be partially extrusive.,,,,"The Sophie Downs Granite does not have many contact relationships, being restricted to the core of the Sophie Downs Dome on HALLS CREEK. The Sophie Downs Granite is intrusive into the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (a coeval unit in the Sophie Downs Suite). However, a concordant relationship is seen in two locations on the southwestern and east-central margins of the Sophie Downs Dome. The Sophie Downs Granite is unconformably overlain by metasedimentary siliciclastic rocks of the Halls Creek Group. The basal unit of the Halls Creek Group, the fluvial Saunders Creek Formation, unconformably overlies the Sophie Downs Granite on the southern and northern ends of the Sophie Downs Dome. The Saunders Creek Formation pinches out on the east-central flank where the overlying Brim Rockhole Formation unconformably overlies the Sophie Downs Granite, i.e. <1 km west of the Brim Rockhole (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 382781E 7993828N). The Saunders Creek Formation and Brim Rockhole Formation were deposited on basement rocks, which were probably exposed as local topographic highs at the time of sedimentation (Phillips et al., 2016). The c. 1835 Ma Woodward Dolerite intrudes the Sophie Downs Granite. Three small outcrops of amphibolite facies metadolerite, mapped as Woodward Dolerite, intrude the Sophie Downs Granite in the Sophie Downs Dome.",,17,,,,4,,,,1912,4,1912,4,"Original descriptions of the Sophie Downs Granite suggested the formation was a pluton that post-dated deposition and folding of the Halls Creek Group (Gemuts, 1971). However, later mapping and geochronological dating showed that the Sophie Downs Granite (and the Sophie Downs Suite) was much older than the Halls Creek Group. Only one sample was taken from the Sophie Downs Granite for geochronology, collected 9 km north-northeast of Sophie Downs Homestead (GA 87598029, Blake et al., 1999, HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 374524E 7988000N). The sample is from a foliated porphyritic granophyre. SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology is reported in a summarized form in Blake et al. (1999) and in more detail in Phillips et al. (2016). Thirty-four analyses were obtained from 34 zircons.

389,41468,P_-SO-xmg-mv,1,Sophie Downs Suite,1,"Leucocratic metagranite, metarhyolite, metabasalt and amphibolite, and minor metasedimentary rock","The Sophie Downs Suite contains the oldest rocks in the Eastern Zone of the Lamboo Province and the Lamboo Province as a whole. The suite comprises mafic and felsic metavolcanic rock of the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (P_-SOdd-xmb-mf), and coeval metamorphosed granitic rocks of the Esaw Monzogranite (P_-SOes-mgml), Junda Microgranite (P_-SOju-mgml), and Sophie Downs Granite (P_-SOsd-mgml). The metavolcanic and granitic rocks have a strong spatial association with each other, and the felsic metavolcanic rocks have a similar whole-rock chemistry to the three metagranite units, suggesting that these four units are genetically related. The Sophie Downs Suite is exposed in two areas: northern exposures are found northeast of Sophie Downs Homestead on HALLS CREEK and ANTRIM and southern exposures are in the Taylor Lookout area on DOCKRELL. The suite consists of greenschist or lower amphibolite facies granophyric granite, microgranite, leucocratic biotite-muscovite monzogranite and garnet-muscovite monzogranite with metabasalt, metarhyolite, metamorphosed volcaniclastic rocks, and metasedimentary rocks, exclusively present in the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics. Units of the Sophie Downs Suite are exposed in the cores of a series of structural domes and large anticlines that are unconformably overlain by metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the Halls Creek Group (P_-HC-xmd-mb). The age of the Sophie Downs Suite is well constrained with SHRIMP U-Pb zircon geochronology of five samples from the suite, indicating that the intrusive and extrusive rocks were emplaced/extruded between c. 1912 and 1904 Ma.","The Sophie Downs Suite is discontinuously exposed over 130 km in the north-northeasterly trending Eastern Zone of the Lamboo Province. Two broad geographical areas can be identified; the Sophie Downs area in the northeast and Taylor Lookout area to the southwest.  The Sophie Downs area is an informal geographic area from immediately east of Sophie Downs Homestead (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 374524E 7988000N), extending up to 26 km northeast of the homestead. The Sophie Downs Suite in this area consists of four north-northeasterly trending structural domes and anticline cores. From west to east they are the Sophie Downs Dome, Brim Anticline, Saunders Creek Dome, and Castle Creek Anticline on HALLS CREEK and ANTRIM.  The Taylor Lookout area is centred on Taylor Lookout (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 321759E 7909295N), which is a small hill off the Old Ballara Road. In this area, the Sophie Downs Suite consists of smaller, irregular, and more widely spread exposures, but is still found in the cores of structural domes. These domes are unnamed and are much more weathered and topographically subdued than those in the Sophie Downs area to the northeast.  The Sophie Downs Granite is only exposed in the Sophie Downs Dome on HALLS CREEK, immediately northeast of the Sophie Downs Homestead. The Junda Microgranite and Esaw Monzogranite are exposed in the Taylor Lookout area in small sheared and faulted domes. The Ding Dong Downs Volcanics are exposed in both areas, but have much more extensive outcrops, and are far better studied from exposures in the Sophie Downs area, particularly the Saunders Creek Dome on HALLS CREEK.","The Sophie Downs Suite is named after the Sophie Downs Homestead (HALLS CREEK, Zone 52, MGA 374524E 7988000N), located about 15 km northeast of the town of Halls Creek. The Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (originally Ding Dong Downs Formation) were defined by Smith (1963) to describe metasedimentary and mafic metavolcanic rocks in the cores of structural domes northeast of Halls Creek, i.e. the Saunders Creek Dome and Castle Creek Anticline. The formation was removed from the Halls Creek Group after mapping an angular unconformity between the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics and the Saunders Creek Formation, i.e. the base of the Halls Creek Group (Hancock and Rutland, 1984; Hancock, 1991; Griffin and Tyler, 1993). Wyborn in Budd et al. (2001) included the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics in the Sophie Downs Suite. The Junda Microgranite and Esaw Monzogranite are comparably recently defined formations and are included in the Sophie Downs Dome, based on SHRIMP U-Pb zircon geochronology, whole-rock geochemistry, and structural relationships (Griffin and Tyler, 1994; Tyler et al., 1998).",,"The Sophie Downs Suite consists of four coeval units: the Sophie Downs Granite (P_-SOsd-mgml), Junda Microgranite (P_-SOju-mgml), Esaw Monzogranite (P_-SOes-mgml), and Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (P_-SOdd-xmb-mf). The former three units are partly or wholly intrusive, while the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics have an extrusive component and intercalated metasedimentary units.  The Sophie Downs Granite consists of fine-grained to coarse-grained granophyric granite with fine-grained microgranite (Gemuts, 1971). Blake et al. (1999) described the unit as mainly massive, leucocratic granite and granophyre with abundant small phenocrysts of euhedral microcline, albite, and quartz. The matrix is very fine-grained or fine-grained with micrographic intergrowths of quartz and alkali feldspar (Blake et al., 1999).  The Esaw Monzogranite consists of extensively weathered tors and bouldery hills made of moderately to strongly recrystallized, leucocratic biotite-muscovite monzogranite, and garnet-muscovite monzogranite (Tyler et al., 1998).  Tyler et al. (1998) described the Junda Microgranite as being mostly foliated and partly recrystallized, fine-grained, leucocratic monzogranite (or a metamicromonzogranite), consisting of fine-grained, granular quartz, plagioclase (albite-oligoclase), microcline, and biotite. Narrow shear zones and closely spaced fractures are common in more massive exposures (Tyler et al., 1998). The Junda Microgranite is locally mylonitic.  The Ding Dong Downs Volcanics are relatively varied, compared to other formations in the Sophie Downs Suite and consist of metamorphosed mafic and felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks intercalated with metasedimentary rocks. Metabasalt dominates the exposures in the well-studied core of the Saunders Creek Dome (Blake et al., 1999, 2000; Phillips et al., 2016). Metabasalt units preserve flows up to 3 m thick and contain up to 1 mm-wide phenocrysts of amphibole and plagioclase in a groundmass of epidote-quartz-feldspar-chlorite with lesser ilmentite, titanite, and hematite. The intercalated metasedimentary rocks are thin-bedded, fine-grained siliciclastic metasandstone and metasiltstone. Flow edges may be brecciated with clasts of metabasalt grading into metasandstone and metasiltstone, possibly preserving peperite (Phillips et al., 2016).  The whole Sophie Downs Suite has been metamorphosed to greenschist or lower amphibolite facies.",Most of the component units of the Sophie Downs Suite are wholly intrusive. The Ding Dong Downs Volcanics consist of partially extrusive rocks as well as metasedimentary component. The metasedimentary rocks do not preserve sufficient sedimentary structures to allow an interpretation of their depositional setting. Some lithofacies may be the result of metamorphosed volcaniclastic protoliths. Ogasawara (1988) suggested that the Sophie Downs Suite could have formed in a rift environment.,,,,"The 1912-1904 Ma Sophie Downs Suite is unconformably overlain by the 1904-1834 Ma Halls Creek Group. Phillips et al. (2016) suggested that the suite may have been partially exposed during initial deposition of the oldest units in the Halls Creek Group, and possibly exerted a strong topographic control on the distribution and sedimentation style of the lower units, particularly the Brim Rockhole Formation. Fluvial rocks of the Saunders Creek Formation overlie all formations of the Sophie Downs Suite with angular unconformity. In many places, the contact is covered or strongly sheared and intruded by quartz veins as in the Esaw Bore (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 320362E 7907754N) and Junda Bore (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 321128E 7918023N) areas. On the western flank of the Saunders Creek Dome, the contact is concordant with no obvious shearing or brecciated zone. The shallow-marine Brim Rockhole Formation is younger and conformably overlies the Saunders Creek Formation. The Brim Rockhole Formation unconformably overlies the Sophie Downs Granite on the eastern flank of the Sophie Downs Dome (Phillips et al., 2016) and in the Junda Bore area (DOCKRELL, Zone 52, MGA 321128E 7918023N). This relationship is possibly the result of the Sophie Downs Suite forming topographic highs during deposition of the Brim Rockhole Formation, leading to shallow-marine rocks conformably overlying fluvial rocks in the Saunders Creek Formation and unconformably overlying or onlapping basement rocks of the Sophie Downs Suite (Phillips et al., 2016).  Both the Sophie Downs and Taylor Lookout areas have been folded and faulted during the Halls Creek Orogeny and younger orogenic events. Consequently, some units within the Sophie Downs Suite, viz. the Junda Microgranite and Ding Dong Downs Volcanics, are in fault contact with the Olympio Formation (uppermost Halls Creek Group). For example, in the Taylor Lookout area on southern DOCKRELL, the roughly east-west-trending Haughton Fault and north-northeasterly trending Woodward Fault places the Junda Microgranite (and a thin section of the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics) against the Olympio Formation. In the Sophie Downs area on northern HALLS CREEK and ANTRIM, the Gentle Annie Fault cuts the core of the Castle Creek Anticline, placing the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (and lower Halls Creek Group) against the younger Olympio Formation.  The c. 1835 Ma Woodward Dolerite intrudes the entire Halls Creek Group and the Sophie Downs Suite. This intrusive relationship has only been mapped in the Sophie Downs area on HALLS CREEK and ANTRIM. These sills are relatively thin compared to the sills that intrude the overlying Halls Creek Group. The Woodward Dolerite intrudes the Sophie Downs Granite on the Sophie Downs Dome (Blake et al., 1999) and the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics on the Saunders Creek Dome and Castle Creek Anticline (Blake and Warren, 1996; Blake et al., 1999) on ANTRIM and HALLS CREEK.",,17,,,Mixed,9,,,,1912,4,1904,5,"The Sophie Downs Suite contains the oldest rocks in the Lamboo Province. Basement rocks of the Lamboo Province are not exposed. The age of the Sophie Downs Suite is constrained between c. 1912 and 1904 Ma, based on five samples (Tyler et al., 1998; Blake et al., 1999; Phillips et al., 2016). The maximum age is provided by a leucocratic granite from the Sophie Downs Granite (GA 87598029, Blake et al., 1999) with a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1912 Â± 4 Ma (Blake et al., 1999; Phillips et al., 2016) and a felsic volcanic rock from the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (GA 93526009, Blake et al., 1999) with a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1912 Â± 3 Ma (Blake et al., 1999; Phillips et al., 2016).  The minimum age is provided by a muscovite schist from the Ding Dong Downs Volcanics (GSWA 206150, Kirkland et al., 2015), which provided a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1904 Â± 5 Ma, which is interpreted as the age of the volcanic protolith (Kirkland et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2016).  The Sophie Downs Suite is unconformably overlain by the Halls Creek Group. A felsic metavolcanic rock in the Brim Rockhole Formation (lower Halls Creek Group) has been dated at 1881 Â± 4 Ma, which is interpreted as the age of volcanism (GA 93526012, Blake et al., 1999; Phillips et al., 2016).

343,17150,P_-SP-s,1,Speewah Group,1,"Sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone","The Paleoproterozoic Speewah Group consists of up to 1500 m of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks which crop out in a narrow belt around the upturned margins of the northeast-trending Halls Creek Orogen and northwest-trending King Leopold Orogen. The group is unconformable or in local fault contact with rocks of the Western Zone of the Lamboo Province.   The Speewah Group is conformably or gradationally overlain by the Kimberley Group. The Speewah Group and lower Kimberley Group are extensively intruded by sills of the Hart Dolerite. A SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age from a granophyre within the Hart Dolerite gives igneous crystallisation ages of c. 1799-1791 Ma interpreted as the age of emplacement and therefore a minimum age for deposition of the Speewah Group.  The Speewah Group is dominated by siliciclastic sedimentary rocks including quartz arenite and feldspathic sandstone as well as subordinate siltstone and conglomerate. The group consists of six formations, in ascending order there are the O'Donnell Formation, Tunganary Formation, Valentine Siltstone, Lansdowne Arkose, Luman Siltstone and Bedford Sandstone. The Speewah Group has been interpreted as fluviomarine.",The Speewah Group is exposed on the northeast- and northwest-trending corridor around the margins of the Kimberley Basin adjacent to the Halls Creek Orogen and the western zone of the Lamboo Province.,"The Speewah Group was defined by Dow et al. (1964) and named after typical exposures in the Speewah Valley in the vicinity of Speewah Yards (ELGEE, 52K 388428E 8181585N).",,"The Speewah Group is a sedimentary siliciclastic succession of quartz-rich and lithic sandstone, feldspathic sandstones, siltstone and shale with minor conglomeratic facies.  The O'Donnell Formation unconformably overlies the felsic volcanics of the Whitewater Volcanics or granitic intrusives of the Paperbark Supersuite. The lower unit of the formation consists of medium- to coarse-grained, well-sorted quartz and lithic sandstones with basal polymictic granule and pebble conglomerates. The O'Donnell Formation fines into an upper unit of grey or green laminated siltstone, occasionally micaceous, interbedded with fine- to medium-grained quartz-rich sandstones.  Conformably overlying the O'Donnell Formation is the Tunganary Formation which is a tripartite division of two sandstone units separated by a siltstone unit. Both the upper and lower sandstones are similar, being white or pale grey, fine- to very coarse-grained, poorly to moderately sorted, feldspathic or lithic-quartz sandstones with thin interbeds of quartz sandstone, pebbly lithic sandstone, and siltstone. The interlayered siltstone unit is a grey or green, planar and wavy laminated siltstone (locally phyllitic) with thin interbeds of quartz sandstone and shale. The siltstone unit may be highly chloritic and sericitic.  The Valentine Siltstone is conformable on the Tunganary Formation and is a poorly exposed unit of red or green laminated siltstone and shale with interbedded sandstone with dacitic to rhyolitic tuffs and felsic volcanics. A SHRMP U-Pb zircon age of 1834 Â± 3 Ma was provided from the felsic volcanic material within the Valentine Siltstone (Page and Sun, 1994).  The Lansdowne Arkose is a conformable thick package of medium- to coarse-grained feldspathic sandstone and arkose with interbedded medium- to coarse-grained quartz sandstone and micaceous siltstone and shale. The formation is abundantly cross-bedded, with trough, tabular, and festoon cross-stratifications.  The Luman Siltstone is a thin unit conformable on the Lansdowne Arkose. It consists of purple or green micaceous shale grading into siltstone with feldspathic sandstone interbeds; some of the sandstone interbeds are hematitic. In many places in the west Kimberley region the Luman Siltstone marks the top of the Speewah Group.  The Bedford Sandstone, previously included as the basal unit of the overlying King Leopold Sandstone of the Kimberley Group, has a lower unit of white, pink, or buff, medium- to coarse-grained, trough and tabular cross-bedded, quartz arenite. A polymictic conglomeratic interval sits on top of the quartz arenite with clasts of quartz, chert, and claystone. This conglomerate grades into red, poorly sorted, medium- to very coarse-grained feldspathic sandstone with a sericitic-hematitic matrix. At the top of Bedford Sandstone is a low angle unconformity surface (the Bedford Surface) with linear structures and erosion features of supposed glaciogene origin. The unconformity, therefore; could possibly represent a period of erosion and/or non-deposition as a result of a Paleoproterozoic glacial episode.  The whole Speewah Group is intruded by sills of the c. 1800 Ma Hart Dolerite with certain formations like the Valentine and Luman Siltstones being preferentially intruded, probably due to low lithological competency. Metamorphic grade is low within Speewah Group rocks and the sediments are mostly undeformed. ","The Speewah Group was probably deposited in fluvial and shallow marine settings (Tyler et al., 1995). The Speewah Group is a dominantly fluvial succession of rocks with a shallow marine incursion. A glacial event at the end of Speewah Group time has been suggested by an unconformity surface at the top of the Bedford Sandstone ornamented with linear grooves, potholes, and frost fissures infilled with fluvio-glacial deposits suggesting glacial advance from the east (to the west) with glaciers reaching sea level at low latitudes (Williams, 2005; Schmidt and Williams, 2008).",360,1500,,"The Speewah Group is unconformable on the rocks of the Western Zone of the Lamboo Province (Marboo Formation, Whitewater Volcanics and granites of the Paperbarks Supersuite) and commonly conformable, gradational or locally erosive under the Kimberley Group. The Speewah Group is intruded by the Hart Dolerite.",,17,,,,2,,,,1814,,1791,,"The oldest unit in the Speewah Group is the O Donnell Formation. Detrital zircon geochronology from a sandstone sample in the O'Donnell Formation yielded a maximum depositional age of 1864 Â± 4 Ma (GSWA 182107, Kirkland et al., 2010). This age, however, is older than underlying felsic volcanic rocks from the Whitewater Volcanics which have yielded igneous crystallisation ages of 1857 Â± 4, 1854 Â± 5 (Griffin et al., 2000), 1854 Â± 6 (Lu et al., 2016) and 1849 Â± 6 Ma (Worden et al., 2008).  Detrital zircon geochronology from the Tunganary Formation , which conformably overlies the O Donnell Formation, reported a maximum depositional age from a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1839 Â± 4 Ma for the 30 youngest analyses with the youngest grain dated at 1817 Â± 9 Ma (GSWA 206101, Kirkland et al., 2014). However, more recent detrital zircon dating of the Tunganary Formation indicated an age component at 1814 Â± 10 Ma from a population of seven young grains with the youngest detrital zircon dated at 1803 Â± 12 Ma (1&sigma;) (GS11031-2, Ramsay et al., 2017). The age of the youngest population at c. 1814 Ma is therefore considered a best estimate for the maximum age of the Speewah Group.  A U-Pb zircon age of 1835 Â± 3 Ma was obtained from a rhyolitic tuff within the Valentine Siltstone, which conformably overlies the Tunganary Formation (Page and Sun, 1994; Sheppard et al., 2012). However, recent dating of the Tunganary Formation by Ramsay et al. (2017) reported younger ages than those in the Valentine Siltstone and interpreted the volcaniclastic rocks as xenocrystic.  The Hart Dolerite extensively intrudes the Speewah Group and lower Kimberley Group. Sills of Hart Dolerite and considered to be contiguous with basalt lava in the Carson Volcanics (Kimberley Group) and together constitute the Hart-Carson Large Igneous Province (Sheppard et al., 2012).  Sheppard et al. (2012) reported U-Pb ages from a granophyric unit within the Hart Dolerite at 1799 Â± 17 Ma from zircon (GA 8759.8003) and 1795 Â± 15 Ma from baddeleyite (GSWA 113574). A minimum age of 1791 Â± 8 Ma was provided from sample GSWA 206156 by Wingate et al. (in prep).

1389,74795,P_-POs-mtqs,146,Spring Camp Formation,1,"Quartzite and quartzâ€“muscovite schist; foliated; quartz metasandstone, feldspathic metasandstone, and quartz-lithic metasandstone; locally ripple marked and cross-bedded","Quartzite, quartz-muscovite schist, and metasandstone are widely distributed throughout the Southern Gascoyne Province outcropping intermittently between YALBRA, ERRABIDDY, and MARQUIS in the south and MOUNT PHILLIPS - EUDAMULLAH in the north. The rocks range from quartz-mica schists in higher-strain zones, to thin- to very thick-bedded, planar laminated or cross-stratified quartz sandstone or recrystallized quartzite. This unit is predominantly composed of well-sorted quartz-feldspar metasandstones and quartzites that are well bedded (10- 80 cm) and locally show abundant ripples, trough cross-stratification, and less typical current lineations (especially around Mount James and the outlier some 4 km to the west). These sedimentary structures indicate that they were deposited in a shallow marine to intertidal environment, although their subsequent modification during younger deformation events precludes any determination of paleoflow. Because these quartzites form the main ridges in the region, the upper surface of the Spring Camp Formation is always erosional and so the true thickness is not known. A minimum estimate from the least deformed and folded quartzites around Mount Gascoyne is about 100 m. U-Pb SHRIMP dating of detrital zircon from a number of samples indicate ages for the youngest detrital components of 1800-1785 Ma and similar major age peaks at c. 2450 Ma and 1810-1800 Ma. These data would suggest that the samples had a similar source region and that they were deposited sometime between c. 1780 and 1680 Ma.","Quartzite, quartz-muscovite schist, and metasandstone are widely distributed throughout the southern Gascoyne Province. The units form the tops of the hills on the southern part of MOUNT PHILLIPS, the southwestern corner of MOUNT AUGUSTUS, the northeast and central parts of YINNETHARRA, the southern parts of PINK HILLS, the central and northern parts of GLENBURGH, DAURIE CREEK, LANDOR, ERRABIDDY, MARQUIS, and YALBRA, and as small outliers straddling the boundary between EUDAMULLAH and MOUNT PHILLIPS (around 5 km north-northwest of Onslow Well). Three outcrops of P_-POs-mtqs lie on both sides of the Ti Tree Syncline. On the southern side, an outcrop approximately 150 m wide by 11 km long can be traced along the southwestern edge of MOUNT PHILLIPS and as a 9 km-long by 1 km-wide horizon on the northeastern part of YINNETHARRA. On the northern side of the Ti Tree syncline, a single outcrop 7 km long by 100-500 m wide straddles the boundary between MOUNT PHILLIPS and YINNETHARRA. On southeastern MOUNT PHILLIPS and adjacent southwestern MOUNT AUGUSTUS two small outliers, each less than 1 km 2 , rest on granites of the Minnie Creek batholith; it also forms a wedge up to 500 m wide between granite of the Minnie Creek batholith and the overlying Mount Augustus Sandstone south of Mount Samuel. On central-eastern YINNETHARRA and central to southwestern PINK HILLS, the quartzites and metasandstones form a semicontinuous train that has been openly folded on a 1-10 km scale and dissected by numerous steep faults. Importantly, this unit forms the majority of outcrop on and around Mount James and Mount Gascoyne. Three, much smaller outliers, ranging in size from 3 km by 3 km to 2 km by 500 m, outcrop on the southern edge of YINNETHARRA around Mount Steere where they are intensely isoclinally folded and contain a penetrative foliation. On GLENBURGH, LANDOR, and DAURIE CREEK, quartzite, quartz-muscovite schist and metasandstone are preserved in the limbs of an upright, tight to isoclinal fold that transects most of the GLENBURGH sheet, with best exposure around Mount Puckford, Fitzpatrick Well, and Sonny Well. The outcrop at Sonny Well straddles the boundary with DAURIE CREEK and units observed at Mount Puckford continue along strike onto LANDOR. Two significant outcrops of metasandstone and metaconglomerate (P_-POb-mxq) form much of the outcrop exposed on Mount Dalgety on DAURIE CREEK. On MARQUIS and ERRABIDDY, the quartzite and metasandstone lie within the Chalba Shear Zone as a series of 5-10 km long, 1-5 km wide, lenticular, fault-bounded slices that make up a total strike length of 60 km.","Subdivision of the Mount James Subgroup into the Biddenew and Spring Camp formations was conducted during the second edition mapping of the type area on southern PINK HILLS and YINNETHARRA in 2007-08 (Sheppard et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2010). The Spring Camp Formation was named after the Spring Camp Creek that flows northeastward from the western margin of Mount Gascoyne.",,"Quartzite and quartz-muscovite schist, where it rests on the Minnie Creek batholith, is less deformed and metamorphosed at lower grade than in the Nardoo Hills area on southwestern MOUNT PHILLIPS. The rocks range from quartz-mica schists in higher strain zones, to thin- to very thick-bedded, planar laminated or cross-stratified quartz metasandstone in lower-strain zones. South-southeast of Mount Samuel, the rocks are massive and locally graded from very coarse sandstone bases. Where the metasandstones are interbedded with metasiltstone or phyllite, they are thin- to thick-bedded (5-80 cm), fine- to coarse-grained, with a parallel planar to faintly undulatory lamination. The outlier north-northwest of Onslow Well comprises metamorphosed, well sorted, quartz-feldspar metasandstone and granule metasandstone with interbedded phyllite, as well as some beds (up to 80 cm thick) of metamorphosed quartz-pebble conglomerate and metamorphosed pebbly sandstone. Clasts consist of quartz and round to oval K-feldspar grains 2-10 mm in diameter, similar to K-feldspar in underlying granites.  On YINNETHARRA, GLENBURGH, LANDOR, DAURIE CREEK, and PINK HILLS the units feature variable strain, from weakly cleaved through to strongly foliated. They comprise predominantly well-sorted quartz-feldspar metasandstones and quartzites that are well bedded (10-80 cm) and locally show abundant ripples, trough cross-stratification, and less typical current lineations (especially around Mount James and the outlier some 4 km to the west). However, in these areas, these structures are commonly oversteepened and have invariably been rotated into parallelism with the regional Mesoproterozoic-aged stretching lineation precluding any determination of the paleoflow direction. These sedimentary structures indicate that the sediments were deposited in a shallow marine to intertidal environment. Commonly the units contain discontinuous layers and lenses (up to 20-30 cm thick and 0.5 - 30 m long) of pebble and gravel metasandstone or quartz-pebble metaconglomerate, all of which are poorly sorted, matrix supported, and feldspar-rich. The quartzite also commonly contains isolated subrounded to rounded clasts, 5-30 mm in diameter, of quartz-vein material and also rare foliated quartzite and recrystallized tourmaline. Around the base of Mount James and the outlier some 4 km to the west, the quartzites and metamorphosed quartz-sandstones contain abundant 0.5 - 10 mm thick, discontinuous, tourmaline-rich, heavy mineral bands that define the bedding or cross-bed foresets.  On ERRABIDDY and MARQUIS the Spring Camp Formation consists predominantly of quartzite that locally contains fuchsite lenses and quartz- metasandstone that is commonly interbedded with metasiltstone. The metamorphosed quartz- metasandstone locally contains abundant ripple marks and cross-beds.  Because these quartzites form the main ridges in the region, the upper surface of the Spring Camp Formation is everywhere erosional and so the true thickness is not known. A minimum estimate from the least deformed and folded quartzites around Mount Gascoyne is about 100 m.",,,100,,"On MOUNT PHILLIPS, YINNETHARRA, MOUNT AUGUSTUS, and PINK HILLS, quartzite, quartz-muscovite schist, and metasandstone of the Spring Camp Formation (P_-POs-mtqs) is observed to lie conformably on units of the Biddenew Formation (P_-POb-mtef, P_-POb-mqef, P_-POb-mhs). Additionally the metasandstones lie unconformably on a variety of metamorphosed Archean to Paleoproterozoic gneisses (AP_-_ha-mgnl, AP_-_ha-mgnw, P_-MO-mgsl) and granites of the Moorarie Supersuite (P_-MO-gmeb, P_-MO-gge, P_-MO-gmp), or deformed and metamorphosed Leake Spring Metamorphics (P_-LS-mlst and P_-LS-mlsm). In some instances the unconformable contact with the underlying gneisses has been sheared and deformed, for example between Halfway Gneiss (AP_-_ha-mgnw) along the southern margin of Mount James on YINNETHARRA. On PINK HILLS these units are in unconformable contact with the overlying Edmund Group of the Bangemall Supergroup (P_-MEy-st) although elsewhere they are faulted against Edmund Group sedimentary rocks (P_-MEv-kd, P_-MEk-sl, P_-MEi-kd), or are intruded by younger Durlacher Supersuite granites (P_-DUda-mgmu). On MOUNT AUGUSTUS, the single outlier lies unconformably on older Moorarie Supersuite granite (P_-MO-gmeb) and the wedge is unconformable on Leake Spring Metamorphic schists (P_-LS-mlpc) and unconformably overlain by the Mount Augustus Sandstone (P_-_au-sc and P_-_au-sp). On ERRABIDDY and MARQUIS, quartzite, quartz-muscovite schist, and metasandstone (P_-POs-mtqs) are everywhere in faulted contact with older and younger granites, gneisses, and metasedimentary units (AP_-mgnl-YNAY, P_-MO-gmeb, P_-DUdn-gmp, P_-MEk-sl, P_-MEv-kd, P_-MEln-ss, P_-_nr-od, P_-MEk-s, P_-MEd-c).",,17,,,,4,,,,1758,,1682,,"Five samples of metamorphosed quartz-metasandstone - quartzite (P_-POs-mtqs), considered to be representative of the Spring Camp Formation, were selected from various parts of the southern Gascoyne Province for SHRIMP U-Pb zircon geochronology. The most southerly sample, a coarse-grained, cross-bedded metasandstone (GSWA 168945), was collected about 3.5 km west-southwest of Bungarra Bore, within the Errabiddy Shear Zone on YALBRA. Most zircons yielded an age of 2616 Â± 6 Ma (Nelson, 2001a), providing a maximum age of deposition. The remaining detrital zircons provided a spectrum of dates between c. 2750 and c. 3325 Ma. The Archean detrital zircons in this sample are consistent with its local provenance from the nearby Yilgarn Craton.  A second sample is a white, flaggy quartzite collected about 3.5 km southeast of Fitzpatrick Well on GLENBURGH (GSWA 168937), about 50-70 km north of Bungarra Bore. The sample contains detrital zircons as young as 1801 Â± 13 Ma (Nelson, 2001b), providing a maximum age of deposition for this quartzite.  Two samples (GSWA 185953 and GSWA 185954) were collected from the summit of a small hill 4.5 km west of Mount James on YINNETHARRA, the type section for the Mount James Subgroup. These sample sites are 45 km north of Fitzpatrick Well. Both samples yielded numerous detrital zircons, and the youngest zircon in both samples is dated at 1785 Â± 7 Ma (Wingate et al., 2010a,b). The last sample was collected 0.6 km southwest of Nardoo Well on MOUNT PHILLIPS about 60 km northwest of Mount James (GSWA 191994). The sample is a medium-grained, recrystallized foliated quartzite that yielded numerous detrital zircons with ages between c. 2692 and c. 1787 Ma (Wingate et al., 2009b). The youngest concordant detrital zircon has an age of 1787 Â± 12 Ma, interpreted as a maximum age of deposition. However, the stratigraphically older (underlying) parts of the Mount James Subgroup (the Biddenew Formation) contain detrital zircons slightly younger than those in the Spring Camp Formation, and as such must provide a better estimate of the maximum depositional age. The youngest detrital zircon, dated at 1758 Â± 18 Ma (GSWA 183255; Wingate et al., 2009a) is from a sample of phyllite (P_-POb-mlpc) from the base of the Mount James Subgroup.  Additional constraints on the maximum and minimum ages of deposition of the Spring Camp Formation are provided by the granites and gneisses on which the unit unconformably lies, and that intrude it. On MOUNT AUGUSTUS, MOUNT PHILLIPS, and YINNETHARRA, the quartz-sandstone rests unconformably on Moorarie Supersuite granites, the youngest (P_-MO-gmeb) of which has been dated at 1782 Â± 5 Ma (Kirkland et al., 2009). This result is younger than detrital zircons in the formation and provides an older limit for its deposition. On MOUNT PHILLIPS, P_-POs-mtqs is intruded by the Davey Well Granite (P_-DUda-mgmu) of the Durlacher Supersuite, a sample of which on EUDAMULLAH has a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 1667 Â± 4 Ma (Wingate et al., 2009c), providing a minimum age of deposition for the sedimentary package. However, the oldest granite to intrude the Pooranoo Metamorphics is a locally schlieric monzogranite (P_-DU-gmbi) dated at 1682 Â± 4 Ma (GSWA 208318; Wingate et al., 2013).  Although the five samples were collected over a large area (and are separated by up to 200 km), all suggest a very local source of sediment, yield similar ages of 1800-1785 Ma for the youngest detrital components, and indicate similar major age components, at c. 2450 and 1810-1805 Ma. These observations suggest that they belong to the same depositional package.",No,,,1,,No,Published,No,No,P_,POs,,,,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No
3215,78759,A-GIs-f,3212,Spring Well Formation,1,Rhyolitic to andesitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks; metamorphosed,"The Spring Well Formation, in the northwestern part of the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane in the Yilgarn Craton, is a locally well exposed, calc-alkaline volcanic succession belonging to the Gindalbie Group. It contains andesitic, dacitic and rhyolitic lava, autobreccia and hyaloclastite; pyroclastic rocks; siltstone, sandstone and conglomerate including polymictic conglomerate representing debris-flow deposits. The volcanic and sedimentary rocks are extensively intruded by sills of andesite and basaltic andesite (Bunting and Williams, 1976; Giles, 1980, 1982; Wyche and Westaway, 1998; Messenger, 2000; Brown et al., 2001; Barley et al., 2002; Barley et al., 2008). All rocks have undergone at least low-grade metamorphism.  SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dating indicates a deposition age of c. 2690 Ma for the rhyolitic and dacitic parts of the Spring Well Formation (Nelson, 1997a; Kositcin et al., 2008). An age of c. 2666 Ma for an andesite dyke at Spring Well (Kositcin et al., 2008) suggests that at least some of the intermediate rocks may be substantially younger than the dominant rhyolite-dacite-andesite volcanic succession.   Outcrops of the Spring Well Formation near Spring Well (Zone 51, MGA 318924E 6913281N), which include a wide variety of lavas and volcaiclastic rocks, as well as coarse breccias and conglomerates, probably represent the volcanic centre (Giles, 1982). Aeromagnetic images indicate the presence of a series of unexposed folds to the west and there is a tightly folded gabbro about 8 km north of Spring Well. The formation is unconformably overlain by the Yandal Sandstone.  Giles (1982) proposed that the Spring Well Formation includes a substantial subaerially deposited component. However, Messenger (2000) said the presence of quench textures and finely laminated black shales supported a dominantly subaqueous depositional environment. Barley et al. (2008) interpreted the Spring Well Formation as an emergent volcanic arc complex.  ","The Spring Well Formation occupies a northerly trending area bounded to the west by the Ockerburry Fault and to the east by granite and the Celia Fault. It occupies the central part of DARLOT and may extend south onto WEEBO and north onto WANGGANNOO, where exposure is very poor.","The Spring Well Formation is named after Spring Well on DARLOT (Zone 51, MGA 318924E 6913281N). It was first described by Bunting and Williams (1976). Barley et al. (2002, 2008) and Brown et al. (2001) have described a well-exposed section, immediately south of Spring Well between Zone 51, MGA 320140E 6912500N and Zone 51, MGA 317140E 6911160N, that contains a substantial range of the rock types that comprise the formation. This is taken to be the type section.",,"The Spring Well Formation is a calc-alkaline volcanic succession with rhyolite, dacite and andesite lava flows and related hyaloclasite, autobreccia and pyroclastic deposits including welded ignimbrite (Giles, 1980, 1982; Wyche and Westaway, 1998; Barley et al., 2002, 2008). It contains a high proportion of sedimentary rocks including shale, volcaniclastic sandstone, and monomictic and polymictic conglomerate. All rocks have undergone at least low-grade metamorphism.  Rhyolites and dacites of the Spring Well Formation are massive to weakly quartz and feldspar porphyritic to crystal rich. Massive, glassy and porphyritic rocks probably represent lavas and high-level intrusions. Some porphyritic rhyolites and dacites contain resorbed and partially embayed grains with commonly preserved reaction rims. Pyroclastic components may preserve vitroclastic textures, broken crystals and lithic fragments with reaction rims. Flow-banded and and brecciated, crystal-rich dacite outcrops to the west and southwest of Spring Well, for example at Zone 51, MGA 318155E 6911290N (Barley et al., 2008). Monomictic breccias and conglomerates probably represent re-sedimented hyaloclastite.  Coarse volcanic breccias and polymictic conglomerates of the Spring Well Formation form prominent ridge cappings near and to the south and southwest of Spring Well, and also on Mount Doolette, which is 4.5 km to the northwest (Zone 51J, MGA 315700E 6916355N). Clasts are angular and typically less than 10 cm across but may be locally up to 1 m. They include a wide variety of clast types from rhyolite to dacite to andesite and represent most rock types found in the volcanic succession. Very coarse units of polymictic conglomerate probably represent debris-flow deposits. Coarse breccias and conglomerates have not been observed in more distal parts of the formation where the succession is dominated by finer grained crystal- and lithic-rich rocks interbedded with sandstone and shale.  Andesite in the Spring Well Formation is present as lava and reworked sedimentary rocks. Barley et al. (2002) note the presence of andesite and basaltic andesite lava flows and sills, along with associated possible hyaloclastite and epiclastic sandstone and conglomerate. Some andesite contains locally abundant amygdales ranging in size from 1-2 mm to up to 7 cm that are typically filled with quartz but which may also contain calcite, epidote and chlorite (Wyche and Westaway, 1998).   Andesite lavas and sills have mostly similar normalized trace-element and patterns, with negative europium anomalies, and are considered to be co-genetic. Dacites and rhyolites have similar but slightly more enriched Primordial Mantle normalized trace patterns than the intermediate rocks with negative europium anomalies (Barley et al., 2008).  Felsic volcanic rocks of the Spring Well Formation have been extensively intruded by sills of andesite and microdiorite. These rocks range from very fine grained to coarsely porphyritic with phenocrysts of zoned plagioclase and clinopyroxene. Intrusive relationships are not always clear. A sample from northeast of Spring Well (Zone 51, MGA 319755E 6913853N) has a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age, interpreted as a magmatic age, of 2666 Â± 7 Ma (Barley et al., 2002; Kositcin et al., 2008). Kositcin et al. (2008) state that the geochemistry and age of this rock suggest that it is not related to the Spring Well Formation but is rather more like rocks of the Black Flag Group (A-BF-xf-s) in the Kalgoorlie area. However, it is not clear how representative this sample is of the abundant andesite and microdiorite intrusions at Spring Well. ","Giles (1982) suggested that the Spring Well Formation includes a substantial subaerially deposited component. However, Messenger (2000) said the presence of quench textures and finely laminated black shales supported a dominantly subaqueous depositional environment. Barley et al.

The relationship between felsic volcanic rocks assigned to the Spring Well Formation and other mafic and sedimentary rocks in the immediate vicinity is unclear due to the poor exposure. An altered porphyritic rhyolite in the Darlot mine sequence, about 11 km east of Spring Well, has a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 2702 Â± 5 Ma for an (GSWA 142821, Nelson, 1997b) and may be part of a volcanic succession that underlies the Spring Well Formation.

These outcrops comprise red limestone and calcarenite underlying the Mereenie Sandstone, and although no fossils are known, they are reported to be similar to rocks of the Larapinta Group mapped on the adjoining BLOODS RANGE 1:250 000 map sheet area in the NT (Wells et al., 1964). In the NT the lower part of the Stokes Siltstone contains shallow marine fossils, while the upper part is unfossiliferous and contains halite pseudomorphs indicating hypersaline conditions. The age of the lower (fossiliferous) part of the Stokes Siltstone is early Late Ordovician based on conodonts studies in the NT.","The Stokes Siltstone is widespread in the central and western parts of the NT Amadeus Basin, but has been removed by Silurian-Devonian erosion in the northeast. In WA two small outcrops of the formation are tentatively identified between Lake Hopkins and the NT border in the northeastern corner of the RAWLINSON 1:250 000 map sheet area (Wells et al., 1964; Forman, 1965).","The Stokes Siltstone was originally named the  Stokes Formation  (Pritchard and Quinlan, 1962), but was renamed and redefined by Wells et al. (1970). It is named after Stokes Pass in the north-central NT Amadeus Basin. Stokes Pass is the type section, where the formation is about 600 m thick (Wells et al., 1970).",,"The tentative outcrops of Stokes Siltstone in WA comprise red limestone and calcarenite (Wells et al., 1964).

This succession is dissimilar to and predates the Nannyarra Sandstone and Gneudna Foration, found in outcrop along the east margin of the northeast Merlinleigh Sub-basin and in subcrop north of Shark Bay. The maximum thickness of 180 m (in Yaringa 1) and limited distribution reflects later erosion rather than depositional extent.    The Sweeney Mia Formation consists of interbedded dolomite and siltstone, in part very thinly so, and disseminated and bedded evaporates. The dominant evaporite mineral is anhydrite, other than in Hamelin Pool 1 where gypsum dominates. Halite is absent. The formation is generally grey, brown and orange to red, reflecting oxidising conditions during deposition. It was deposited in arid oxidising sabhka, lagoonal and nearshore marine conditions.  The Sweeney Mia Formation contains rare, non-diagnostic Late Silurian to Devonian conodonts and fish remains. Its age is constrained by an Early Devonian (Lockovian) conodont found in the underlying Kopke Sandstone, and by its apparent disconformable relationship to the Middle to Late Devonian Nannyarra Sandstone.","The Sweeney Mia Formation has been intersected in petroleum and mineral exploration, water, and stratigraphic drill holes in the Shark Bay region and in Edaggee 1. The only unequivocal intersections are in Yaringa 1 (146 - 326 m), Hamelin Pool 1 (209 - 346 m) and 2 (197 - 325 m), Yaringa East 1 (244 - 398 m) and, further north, Edaggee 1 (311 - 351 m TD). In a water bore near Edaggee 1, the top of the underlying Kopke Sandstone is at 360 m (Dixon et al., 2003), implying a thickness of about 50 m. Mory et al. (2003) re-evaluated the succession intersected in Mooka 1, and considered the interval between 200.6 m and 260.5 m was Sweeney Mia Formation rather than Faure Formation, as initially interpreted by Mory and Yasin (1998). Iasky and Mory (1999) considered it is probably present in several water bores on Yalbalgo and Marron Stations (see their Appendix 4). It does not outcrop, but may correlate with a finer grained facies association of the Tumblagooda Sandstone, possibly FA4. The limited distribution is attributed to later erosion rather than very limited deposition.  Iasky and Mory (1999, Appendix 4) recorded the top of the Sweeney Mia Formation in Yaringa East 1 as 204 m, but showed it at the accepted position at 244 m in a figure. The 204 -244 m interval is otherwise assigned to the Nannyarra Sandstone.","The Sweeney Mia Formation is named after Point Sweeney Mia, south southwest of Carbla homestead on the east side of Hamelin Pool. The locality is shown on the Yaringa 1:250 000 Geological Sheet (Van de Graaff et al., 1983) but not on the Yaringa 1:250 000 topographic map. It was named by Hocking (1985) and described more fully by Hocking et al. (1987), as part of the Kalbarri Group. It was initially referred to as the informal 'Unknown Formation, Unit A' by Henderson and Shannon (1968), and included in the Dirk Hartog Formation by Playford et al. (1975). Gorter et al. (1994) abandoned the Kalbarri Group, and the Sweeney Mia Formation is presently ungrouped. It was miss-spelt, as Sweeny Mia, by Yasin and Mory (1999b).  The type section is in Yaringa 1 petroleum exploration well between 146 and 326 m, where it is conformable on the Kopke Sandstone.",,"The Sweeney Mia Formation is a fine-grained, dolomitic and evaporitic red bed unit, consisting of interbedded dolomite and siltstone, in part very thinly so, fine- and very fine-grained sandstone, and disseminated and bedded evaporites. The dominant evaporite mineral is anhydrite, except in Hamelin Pool 1, where the dolomite and mudstone are similar to the section in Yaringa 1 but the dominant evaporite is gypsum. In Hamelin Pool 2, 9.5 km south of Yaringa 1, the evaporites are anhydrite containing a trace of gypsum. Halite is absent. The formation is generally grey, brown and orange to red, reflecting oxidising conditions during deposition.  A fully cored section in Yaringa East 1 was described in detail by Yasin and Mory (1999). There, a basal coarse- to very coarse-grained sandstone and overlying pebble lag suggests a slight hiatus between it and the Kopke Sandstone. A 30 m thick intraclastic breccia is present near the top of the formation, and was interpreted as a collapse breccia due to post-depositional evaporite solution or mobilization (Yasin and Mory, 1999) ","The Sweeney Mia Formation was deposited in low-energy coastal sabhka and lagoon settings, with limited marine incursions. The climate was arid and oxidising, based on the characteristic brown, orange and red colour.

2963,,P_-ETs-kds,2955,Sweetwaters Well Dolomite,1,Stromatolitic dolomite and limestone; lesser siltstone and sandstone,"The Sweetwaters Well Dolomite ( P_ETs-kds ) is a distinctive stromatolitic dolomite facies at the top of the Yelma Formation, formerly the Sweetwaters Well Member of the Yelma Formation. Thin volcaniclastic horizons have been identified in core, but not recognized in outcrop, both at the top and near the base of the formation. It is recognised along the southwestern and western margins of the Earaheedy Basin approximately west of the Shoemaker Structure and Lake Teague, and is 250 to 300 m thick in drillhole intersections. Much of the formation in the western Earaheedy Basin was previously identified as carbonate facies of the Yelma Formation. Similar facies in the northern, deformed part of the basin may belong to the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite, or be facies correlatives at a lower stratigraphic level. The formation is a coastal saline lagoon deposit, within which hypersaline conditions are evidenced by sedimentary structures in core. The Sweetwaters Well Dolomite increases in thickness dramatically over the boundary between underlying basement terranes of the Yilgarn Craton, from a few tens of metres in the east to hundreds of metres to the west, indicating the terrane boundaries were active syn-depositional growth structures during the Glenburgh Orogeny, rather than solely Archean entities related to accretion of the Yilgarn Craton.   The formation hosts Mississippi Valley type Zn-Pb-Cu-Ba mineralization west of the Shoemaker Impact Structure and Lake Nabberu. The host of the Magellan lead oxide deposit, west of Wiluna, is considered to be very weathered Sweetwaters Well Dolomite.  The Sweetwaters Well Dolomite was previously thought to grade upwards into the Frere Formation, but the contact in drillcore is sharp where it can be identified, and radiometric dating of tuffaceous laminae in the uppermost part of the unit (1971 to 1946 Ma) indicates a hiatus of 60 to 80 Ma between it and the Frere Formation (1890 Ma).","The Sweetwaters Well Dolomite is recognized along the southwestern and western margins of the Earaheedy Basin. Scattered carbonate rocks along the deformed northern margin on METHWIN (Hocking and Jones, 1999) and FAIRBAIRN (Pirajno et al., 1999) may be part of the member, but are not formally assigned to it because their stratigraphic position is uncertain. They may be at the same level or facies equivalents lower in the Yelma Formation. The Sweetwaters Well Dolomite is 100 to 300 m thick in drillcore. The maximum known thickness is greater than 400 m, in CWT001 and adjacent outcrops on THADUNA near Lake Gregory (see Pirajno et al., 2009, fig. 7). This section was interpreted by Pirajno and Adamindes (1998) and Pirajno et al. as dolomitic and evaporitic Yelma Formation with some Sweetwaters Dolomite Member at the top, but is here considered to be all Sweetwaters Well Dolomite.  The distribution of the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite appears to be controlled by terrance boundaries in the underlying Yilgarn Craton (Cassidy et al., 2006). It is absent or very thin east of the boundary between the Burtville and Kurnalpi Terranes, and thickens rapidly west of the northwards projection of the boundary. The unit may thicken again over the boundary between the Kurnalpi and Kalgoorlie Terranes. There is no obvious surface expression of the fault systems and sutures along these terrane boundaries, which together with the changes in thickness suggests they were active growth structures during the time of deposition of the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite (i.e. the Glenburgh Orogeny) rather than later, rather than solely Archean entities active only during accretion of the Yilgarn Craton.","The Sweetwaters Well Member of the Yelma Formation was named by Pirajno and Adamides (1998) after Sweetwaters Well on MERRIE, and defined by Hocking et al. (2000) after being shown on maps  previously (Pirajno and Adamides, 1997; Pirajno et al., 1999; Adamides, 1999; Pirajno, 1999), as  P_Eyw . It was referred to informally in older company reports as the  Navajo Dolomite'. It was raised to formation status by Occhipinti et al. (2017), as Sweetwaters Well Dolomite ( P_ETs-kds ), because it is considered sufficiently distinct from, rather than a part of, the Yelma Formation ( P_ETy-sz ), and is described in greater detail here. It and the Yelma Formation form a re-defined Tooloo Group (Occhipinti et al., 2017). The name Sweetwaters Well Dolomite is preferred because the Sweetwater Member of the Baralandji Formation is a Proterozoic unit in the Tompkinson Province of the Northern Territory.  The type locality is around the southern margin of an island in Lake Nabberu (NABBERU, 272000E 7144800N to 272500E 7145300N). Adamides (2000) specified a type section 3.5 km southeast of Sweetwaters Well (MERRIE, 238800E 7164800N), based on mapping done prior to that on NABBERU - this is now considered as a reference locality, together with the section between 314.5 and 373.8 m drilled depth in drillhole DDH 28 (NABBERU, MGA 264200E, 7161250N; core held at Perth Core Library by Geological Survey of Western Australia). CWT001 (THADUNA) is a third reference section, located in the western part of the basin. ",,"The Sweetwaters Well Dolomite consists mainly of stromatolitic dolomite with sandy dolomite and dolomitic feldspathic sandstone intervals at the top and bottom of the dolomitic succession. The upper dolomitic feldspathic sandstone unit grades eastward to a micaceous sandstone and is overlain by granular iron formation rocks of the Frere Formation. The lower contact of the member is marked by about 15 metres of interbedded sandstone and dolomite passing upward to a sandy and feldspathic dolomite unit that contains quartz, microcline, albite, chert and micritic dolomite embedded in a coarse-grained dolomite cement. The dolomite is light grey to grey in colour, massive to algal laminated, commonly with stromatolite forms. In northwest NABBERU, the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite was intersected in a number of drillholes sunk through the Frere Formation by Renison Gold Fields Ltd (see Pirajno et al., 2004). Tepee structures, crystal-mush horizons, and flat-pebble carbonate conglomerate are present. Samples of stromatolitic dolomite collected from drill core show two phases or domains of dolomite - one an aggregate of coarse-grained dolomite crystals, the other microcrystalline (micritic) and associated with microbial laminae. The coarser-grained dolomite has intergranular microcrystalline quartz and sericite, which tend to replace the coarser dolomite. In some cases micritic dolomite forms peloids that are cemented by chalcedonic quartz. Locally, the carbonate material is replaced by cryptocrystalline quartz (chert) and chalcedonic quartz.  Along the southern shore of Lake Nabberu, about 9 km east-northeast of Horse Bore (NABBERU) in scattered outcrops of Sweetwaters Well Dolomite, carbonates are generally replaced by chert, except for an area along a small tributary where there are good exposures of subhorizontal stromatolitic dolomite. Here, the dolomite exhibits fine microbial laminae and includes the stromatolites  Murzuna nabberuensis ,  Omachtenia teagiana  and  Asperia digitata  (Grey 1984; 1994). Drillcore sections indicate that stromatolites are generally present in metre-scale upward-shallowing cycles. They include  Asperia digitata  (Grey, 1984, 1986, 1994), which is believed to have grown in restricted, quiet water environment, possibly supratidal ponds;  Pilbaria deverella  (Grey, 1984) indicative of moderately high-energy, lagoonal conditions; and  Ephyaltes edingunnensis  (Grey, 1994), which formed in deeper quiet water, and  Murgurra nabberuensis  (Grey, 1984) which colonised moderate energy patch reefs. Details of stromatolite taxa of the Earaheedy Basin can be found in Grey (1984, 1994). Grey (1994) suggested that these stromatolite forms indicated an upward shallowing, lagoon to supratidal setting.  Sandy dolomite containing thin volcaniclastic shard-rich silty beds is present in one locality, low in the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite.  Zinc-Pb-Cu-Ba mineralisation is hosted in stromatolitic carbonate rocks of the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite west of the Shoemaker impact structure (Pirajno, 2002). Sphalerite, galena, pyrite, and chalcopyrite are present as fracture and vug fills, or replacement of stromatolitic carbonate. The mineralization extends discontinuously along 50 km of strike length. On MERRIE (Adamides, 2000), Zn-Pb sulfide mineralization is found in the interstices of stromatolite columns in the Sweetwaters Well area. Elsewhere, except for the Iroquois prospect close to the Shoemaker structure, the mineralization does not outcrop, but was intersected in drillholes (TDH 1 to TDH 28) at depths ranging from 100 to 350 m. These base metal prospects, 6 km west-northwest of Mount Teague were investigated in detail by Renison Goldfields Consolidated (see Pirajno et al. 2004). Best assay results of reported drillcore intersections gave 11m @1.3 % Zn and 0.2 % Pb, 3m @ 2.3 % Zn and 0.2 % Pb, 6m @ 1.86 % Zn and 0.23 % Pb, 20m @ 0.88 % Zn and 0.1 % Pb. Best assay results reported from reverse circulation (RC) drilling gave 13m @ 2.36 % Zn and 0.72 % Pb. Barium values from mineralised rock chip samples range from 1000 to 4000 ppm.  Base metal mineralization in the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite has many features consistent with carbonate-hosted Mississippi Valley-type ore deposits (MVT) -- colloform textures, shelf carbonate host near the margin of a sedimentary basin (Garven and Raffensperger, 1997), and low-temperature and moderate salinity fluids (Teen, 1996). McQuitty and Pascoe (1998) suggested that the Magellan non-sulfide Pb deposit and the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite Zn-Pb occurrences are part of the same MVT mineralising event. Muhling et al. (2012) dated authigenic monazite which they associated with mineralization at Magellan and in the Teague area at 1815 +/- 13 Ma and 1811 +/- 13 Ma respectively.  On THADUNA, disseminations of chalcopyrite and pyrite are associated with kerogen in dolomite breccia in drillcore from Cork Tree Well (see Pirajno and Adamides, 1998) now considered to be Sweetwaters Well Dolomite rather than Yelma Formation. In drillhole CTW 002, sulfide mineralization (mainly pyrite and chalcopyrite), is associated with specks of kerogen in dolomite breccia. Breccia clasts are rimmed by fine pyrite and kerogen, and open spaces are filled with euhedral quartz and chalcedony. This occurrence was also investigated by Rasmussen and Krapez (2000), who found small quantities of sulphoarsenides, arsenides, uraninite and cassiterite in drill core in fractured dolomitised limestone in the western Earaheedy Basin, near the unconformity with the underlying Windplain Group (Yerrida Basin). On the basis of textural relationships, Rasmussen and Krapez (2000) concluded that hydrocarbon migration and sulfide mineralization were synchronous, but they also recognised multiple phases of hydrothermal fluid circulation.  Ore minerals include pyrite and sphalerite, with minor amounts of galena, chalcopyrite, bornite and tetrahedrite. These sulfides are associated with jig-saw breccias, open spaces, microfracture infills and microbial laminae. Cross-cutting barite veins are locally present, usually in silicified dolomite. Minor amounts of pyrobitumen, associated with sulfides, have also been identified (Teen, 1996).  ","Grey (1984, 1994) considered that the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite was deposited in settings ranging from supratidal ponds and lagoons to nearshore low to  moderate energy, based largely on stromatolite morphology. Jones et al. (2000) suggested a coastal lagoonal setting. The metre-scale shallowing upward cycles may be a product of orbital forcing. Tepee structures, crystal-mush horizons, and flat-pebble carbonate conglomerate can be recognized in drillcore from the unit, and indicate hypersaline conditions in coastal sabkas and barred lagoons.   The rapid increase in thickness west of the Shoemaker structure (Lake Teague) over the boundary between the Kurnalpi and Burtville Terranes of the underlying Yilgarn Craton is indicative of syndepositional tectonic activity and structural control of the basin geometry.",100,400,,The Sweetwaters Well Dolomite was previously considered a carbonate facies in the upper Yelma Formation.

One maximum age constraint is provided by the minimum age of detrital zircons from the Yelma Formation analysed by Matonia (2009), 1971 +/-26 Ma, although the stratigraphic position of these zircons is uncertain. The Sweetwaters Well Dolomite is inferred to grade laterally eastwards into, and partially overlie, the Yelma Formation. Alternatively, Sheppard et al. (2016) suggested that the Imbin quartz-feldspar porphry, which has been dated as 1990 +/- 6 Ma (Nelson, 2001), is interbedded with the lower Yelma Formation, rather than underlying it.

It consists of clast-supported  interbedded cobble to boulder and pebble to cobble conglomerate, with lenses of ferruginous sandstone, and dips southeastward at about 20 to 40 degrees. Clast imbrication suggests northwards current flow. A sandy pisolitic ironstone lens is probably a syndepositional ferricrete, and the conglomerate itself is probably an incised valley deposit of fluvial origin. The conglomerate postdates deformation of the Tooloo Group, on which it is angularly unconformable. Because it is moderately folded, it is unlikely to be Phanerozoic or even Neoproterozoic. It is therefore tentatively correlated with the Scorpion Group, although it could have been deposited at any time in the Mesoproterozoic or latest Paleoproterozoic.","The Sydney Heads Pass Conglomerate has been recognized only in the vicinity of Sydney Heads Pass (377400E 7178500N), on the Glen Ayle - Wiluna road. There, it is up to about 40 m thick (Commander et al., 1982), and appears to be an isolated valley fill deposit. The conglomerate forms a plateau about 20 m above the valley floor, but is lower than surrounding ridge crests, of Yelma Formation.","The Sydney Heads Pass Conglomerate has been recognized only in the vicinity of Sydney Heads Pass, after which it is named. The type area is here designated as the cliff exposures in the pass, on the east side of the Glen Ayle - Wiluna road. The formation was named and initially described by Commander et al. (1979), then by Goode (1981), and later by Commander et al. (1982) and Hocking et al. (2001).",,"The Sydney Heads Pass Conglomerate comprises alternations of cobble to boulder and granule to pebble conglomerate with local lenses of highly ferruginous sandstone. The conglomerate is clast supported, with rounded cobbles up to 15-20 cm in diameter, in a sandy matrix. Clasts include ferruginous sandstone, probably derived from the Frere Formation, quartz, and chert. Commander et al. (1982) noted pebbles were composed of vein quartz, white quartzite, ferruginous arenite, hematitic shale, and granular iron-formation. Scattered imbricated clasts suggest current flow from the south. Directly east of the pass, coarse conglomerate contains rounded cobbles more than 30 cm in diameter. The conglomerate fines upwards, and is increasingly interbedded with poorly sorted, flaggy sandstone and shale. A sandy pisolitic ironstone is present in lenses up to 30 cm thick, near the top of the cliff east of the road. This clearly dips with the remainder of the conglomerate, and is interpreted as a syndepositional ferricrete.","The Sydney Heads Pass Conglomerate is interpreted as a fluvial deposit infilling an incised valley.

3088,17624,E-_th-xbb-s,1574,Table Hill Volcanics,1,Basalt in multiple flows; in part vesicular or amygdaloidal; minor interbedded sandstone and siltstone,"The Table Hill Volcanics are Upper Cambrian (about 505 Ma) mafic extrusive rocks interbedded with lesser volcaniclastic and siliciclastic sandstone.They form the most southern part of the Kalkarindji Large Igneous Province (Glass and Phillips, 2006). They are sporadically exposed across the Officer Basin in Western and South Australia (where the name Kulyong Formation has been abandoned in favour of Table Hill Volcanics), and have been intersected by several drill holes. A subaerial setting is indicated by interbedded eolian sandstone and fluvial sandstone, by the spheroidal amgydales in basalts, and by the smooth undulating nature of flow tops in outcrop.","The Table Hill Volcanics are exposed in scattered, generally poor outcrops across the Officer Basin in Western Australia and just over the border into South Australia, and have been intersected in many drill holes in the Offcier Basin in Western Australia. Notable among these are Yowalga 2 (112 m), Westwood 1 (71 m), and Empress 1/1A (76 m). Jackson and van de Graaff (1981) recognized two flows, separated by a thin sandstone interval in all occurences, but six flows are preserved in Empress 1/1A. The thickest known exposure is 26 m, in the type section in the east side of Table Hill.  In the northwest Officer Basin, Akubra 1 and Boondawari 1 intersected gabbroic rocks at two levels: 64-181 m (TD) and at 1280-1366 m (TD) respectively. SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology of baddeleyite and zircon from gabbro in Boondawari 1 yielded a crystallization age of 508 Â± 5 Ma (Wingate, 2002, written comm.). These are presumably intrusive feeders for Table Hill Volcanics, no longer preserved (or not recognised) in the northwestern Officer Basin. Mafic sills of the Warakurna large igneous province, which are about 1080 Ma (Morris and Pirajno, 2000?) are intruded by later dykes, invariably weathered to clay minerals, that may also correlate with the Table Hill Volcanics.   Note that any occurences previously referred to the Kulyong Volcanics are now assigned to the Table Hill Volcanics. ","The Table Hill Volcanics are named after Table Hill, on TALBOT 1:250 000 sheet. The type section is on the east side of the hill (about MGA Zone 5229300E 7072100N) where the formation is more than 26 m thick in a deep gully (Jackson and van de Graaff, 1981). The name was introduced by Peers (1969). Jackson and van de Graaff (1981) specified a reference section in BMR Westwood 1, and the section in Empress 1A provides a second, fully cored, publically available reference section.  The Kulyong Formation was abandoned, in favour of Table Hill Volcanics, for correlative interbedded basalts and sedimentary rocks on BIRKSGATE 1:250 000 sheet in South Australia (Australian Stratigraphic Names Database, 2009). Although Kulyong has priority, there are far fewer exposures and no drill hole intersections in South Australia.",,"Jackson and van de Graaff (1981) provide details of the lithology and chemistry of the Table Hill Volcanics in outcrop and drillhole intersections prior to the mid 1970s.  In Empress 1 and 1A, the Table Hill Volcanics consist of six volcanic flows of fine- to coarse-grained basalt, which is amygdaloidal, vesicular, and massive in parts (Stevens and Apak, 1999). The flows range from 7.8 to 22.9 m thickness. Flow thickness generally increases upwards, and grain size increases with depth in each, as could be expected. Amygdales are abundant at all the tops and some of the bases of the flows, and are typically filled with either quartz, calcite, green clay, or combinations thereof. These minerals also formed as vein and fracture fillings. Dark-green, crystalline zeolites were identified in some amygdales. Xenoliths of sandstone and quartzite are present in some of the basalts. Only the uppermost flow top is weathered, implying brief hiatuses between flows. The number of flows and the thickness of Table Hill Volcanics varies in nearby drillhole intersections (Stevens and Apak, 1999), suggesting topographic relief on the underlying unconformity.  There is a thin sandstone bed at the base of the Table Hill Volcanics in Empress 1, and sandstones are interbedded with volcanic rocks in outcrops on ROBERT 1:250 000 sheet on the 'Eagle Highway' (MGA Zone 51 645200E 7105600N). In the latter, about 5 m of volcanic scoria is present beneath volcaniclastic and then siliciclastic, probably eolian, sandstone, overlain by basalt in a section about 12 m thick in total. If the identification of scoria, rather than a flow top, is correct then the vent responsible may be relatively nearby.","Sedimentary rocks interbedded with the Table Hill Volcanics range from muddy volcaniclastic rocks to quartzose sandstone, in places well sorted and medium grained, and in places coarse grained and texturally immature. There are no peperites known or indications of subaqueous extrusion. Extrusion of the volcanics is therefore taken to be subaerial, with local fluvial and eolian sediments. Jackson and van de Graaff (1981) considered the lavas were pahehoe type, based on the smooth undulating flow tops seen at Mount Smith on ROBERT 1:250 000 sheet (MGA ZOne 51 aaaaaannnnn) and the presence of spheroidal, undistorted amydales in outcrop.",1,112,,"The Table Hills Volcanics are essentially flat lying, and as such rest with variable angular unconformity on older units, although contacts are not exposed other than in drillholes. The volcanics are overlain by Lennis Sandstone, Wanna Formation, or Paterson Formation, presumably unconformably. The Lennis Sandstone may be of Late Cambrian-Ordovician age, and thus possibly conformable.",,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,508,10,505,3,"Mafic extrusive rocks in Empress 1A interpreted as part of the Table Hill Volcanics extend from 210 to 286 m drilled depth (Stevens and Apak, 1999).

1331,37095,P_-MEkt-fr,1326,Tangadee Rhyolite,1,Massive or flow banded rhyolite; locally porphyritic,"Small exposures of Tangadee Rhyolite coherent lava (P_-MEkt-fr) are confined to the western part of the Coobarra Dome on CALYIE. These rocks have a maximum thickness of about 35 m and are present within the lower part of the Kiangi Creek Formation. They are underlain by coarse-grained sandstone and have an irregular, erosive contact with the overlying conglomerate and pebbly sandstone. The coherent rhyolite bodies are broadly concordant with the surrounding stratigraphy and their internal structure commonly shows a fine, varicoloured lamination, interpreted as flow banding. In one rhyolite body, the flow banding forms a large-scale, overturned synformal fold, whose upper limb is, in places, truncated and capped by a thin, planar layer of rhyolite. In thin section the felsic rock consists mainly of euhedral to anhedral quartz and feldspar phenocrysts, in a cryptocrystalline groundmass of quartz and minor microcline, with accessory biotite, chlorite, zircon, and opaque minerals. The geochemistry of the rhyolite indicates that it is strongly altered and is characterized by high values of K 2 O, low Na 2 O, and slightly elevated SiO 2 . Although the precise origin of member P_-MEkt-fr is unclear, it is likely that is was extruded, either as viscous, glassy lava flows or lava domes, or else formed high-level intrusions. The age of Tangadee Rhyolite magmatism is uncertain. The lithology and field relationships suggest that the rhyolites are coeval with the lower Kiangi Creek Formation host rocks. However, results from Rb-Sr whole-rock, and SHRIMP U-Pb zircon and xenotime geochronology, give ages that are either older or younger than the expected 1590-1517 Ma age of the host succession.","The Tangadee Rhyolite coherent lava (P_-MEkt-fr) has a maximum thickness of about 35 m and outcrops over a strike length of 2.7 km on the western part of the Coobarra Dome on CALYIE. The principal outcrops are about 60 m above the base of the Kiangi Creek Formation 21 km east northeast of the Abra polymetallic deposit (around Zone 50, MGA 680550E 7276300N). A second, smaller exposure is located approximately 5 km south of the main outcrop area (Zone 50, MGA 683360E 7272000N). ","The small bodies of coherent rhyolite (P_-MEkt-fr), interbedded with lower Kiangi Creek Formation sandstone and conglomerate on CALYIE, were first described by Gee et al. (1976), who referred to them as 'rhyolite near Tangadee'. This terminology was later adopted by Muhling and Brakel (1985), although the same rocks were described as an unnamed Bangemall Group unit by Brakel et al. (1978). The presence of the felsic volcaniclastic rocks (PMEkt-fn), in association with the coherent rhyolite bodies, was noted by Vogt and Stumfl (1987). Subsequent descriptions used the informal name 'Tangadee rhyolite' to describe these rocks (Collins and McDonald, 1994; Vogt, 1995). This name was later formalized to 'Tangadee Rhyolite' by Occhipinti et al. (1998), although the unit was only mentioned briefly by these workers.",,"Gee et al. (1976), Brakel et al. (1978), and Vogt (1995) describe the presence of six small bodies of coherent rhyolite that lie about 60 m above the base of the sedimentary succession on the northern limb of the Coobarra Dome. The coherent rhyolite bodies are broadly concordant with the surrounding stratigraphy and their internal structure commonly shows a fine, varicoloured lamination, together with some fragmented layers (Gee et al., 1976). The rhyolite is aphanitic with a pearly lustre, and mostly colour-banded in tones of pale cream and buff. The more oxidized varieties are pallid, but the banding is accentuated by very thin pale-green and pink laminae, whereas those fresh specimens still retaining unoxidized pyrite, are streaked with black and dark-grey banding. Gee et al. (1976) noted that in one rhyolite body the varicoloured layering forms a large-scale, overturned synformal fold whose upper limb is, in places, truncated and capped by a thin, planar layer of rhyolite. This folded layering is not associated with any tectonic fabric and is interpreted as primary flow-banding (Gee et al., 1976).   In thin section the felsic rock consists mainly of euhedral to anhedral quartz and feldspar phenocrysts in a cryptocrystalline groundmass of quartz and minor microcline, with accessory biotite, chlorite, zircon, and opaque minerals (Gee et al., 1976). The quartz phenocrysts show hexagonal or rhomboidal outlines, preserving the bipyramidal shape of &szlig;-quartz. Most phenocrysts are embayed, indicating resorption or corrosion by the groundmass, and many have become well rounded. The feldspar phenocrysts consist of a granular intergrowth of quartz and microcline, and were considered by Gee et al. (1976) to have originally been sanidine. These authors also reported rare, irregular or distinctly spherical-shaped lithophysae of pyrite, ilmenorutile, chlorite, and carbonate encased by quartz and microcline. The lithophysae are wrapped by the banding and therefore were in existence as solid objects while the volcanic material was still moving (Gee et al., 1976).  Rasmussen et al. (2010) summarize the available geochemistry of the coherent rhyolite and reiterate the findings of earlier workers (Gee et al., 1976; Muhling and Brakel, 1985; Vogt, 1995) who note that the rhyolite samples are chemically altered and are characterized by high values of K 2 O, low Na 2 O, and slightly elevated SiO 2 .","Although the exact environmental setting of the coherent, flow-banded rhyolite is unclear, it is likely that these rocks were extruded, either as viscous, glassy lava flows or lava domes, or else formed as high-level intrusions. Gee et al. (1976) point out that the rhyolite appears to have erupted along a fissure, forming a line of viscous domes that grew upward and outward as the earlier extruded rhyolite was shouldered aside by later extrusions. The plugs were then eroded, which removed most of the associated debris. Based upon this model, the total volume of rhyolite extruded would not exceed 0.02 km 3 . The amount removed by erosion is unknown, but could be of the same order of magnitude (Gee et al., 1976).",,35,,"Coherent lava of the Tangadee Rhyolite is underlain by Kiangi Creek Formation members P_-MEk-st and P_-MEk-stq and overlain by members P_-MEk-sc and P_-MEk-st of the same formation. Angular clasts of rhyolite are reported to be present within the overlying conglomerate (Gee et al. 1976), although this has not been confirmed during more recent GSWA mapping.",,17,,,,5,,,,1590,,1517,,"Although it has been subject to a number of geochronological studies, using different methodologies, there is still no clear consensus as to the age of Tangadee Rhyolite magmatism. The lithology and field relationships of the coherent rhyolite (P_-MEkt-fr) and the associated volcaniclastic rocks (P_-MEkt-fn) suggest that they are high-level intrusive and syndepositional extrusive felsic rocks, respectively. However, results from Rb-Sr whole-rock and SHRIMP U-Pb zircon and xenotime geochronology give ages that are either older or younger than expected, and lie outside the 1590-1517 Ma inferred age of the Kiangi Creek Formation host rocks.  Gee et al. (1976) obtained a Rb-Sr isochron date of 1098 Â± 42 Ma from the coherent rhyolite, but argued that this is the age of the strong potassic alteration observed in these rocks. The same rocks subsequently yielded a SHRIMP U-Pb maximum age of 1638 Â± 14 Ma, based on the presence of two xenocrystic zircons (GSWA 91591, Nelson, 1995).  Euhedral xenotime extracted from the Tangadee Rhyolite (GSWA 149020) gives two main age components. Oscillatory-zoned cores yield a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1235 Â± 19 Ma, whereas unzoned rims give a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1030 Â± 40 Ma (Rasmussen et al., 2010). Both cores and rims have variable, but generally low U concentrations (150-1000 ppm) and high Th concentrations (650-10 000 ppm), which are typical of xenotime grown from hydrothermal fluids rather than from a felsic magma (Zi et al., 2015). Despite the strong magmatic-looking oscillatory zoning in the cores, the U and Th compositions suggest growth during hydrothermal activity. There are several possible explanations for the age distribution of the xenotime in the Tangadee Rhyolite (assuming that the rhyolite is an extrusive rather than low-level intrusive unit):  <div>1) The oscillatory-zoned cores are xenocrystic, and therefore do not represent the age of the rhyolite,</div>
<div>whereas the rims are magmatic. This implies an extrusion age of c. 1030 Ma, which suggests that the associated sedimentary sequences are younger than either the 1679-1455 Ma Edmund Group or the 1170-1071 Ma Collier Group.</div>
 2) The cores formed during crystallization of the rhyolite, whereas the younger rims formed during a later hydrothermal event (c. 1030 Ma). This would suggest that the rhyolite was extruded at c. 1235 Ma and that the surrounding sedimentary rocks are much younger than the 1679-1455 Ma Edmund Group.  3) Both generations of xenotime formed long after deposition during two different hydrothermal events. This scenario would suggest that the depositional age of the Tangadee Rhyolite is somewhere between c. 1640 Ma from the youngest xenocrystic zircons in the rhyolite and c. 1235 Ma from the oldest hydrothermal xenotime.  Rasmussen et al. (2010) argue that the first scenario is unlikely because it suggests that the sedimentary rocks onto which the Tangadee Rhyolite was extruded are younger than either the Edmund Group or overlying Collier Group. The second scenario explains the available data, but would indicate that the surrounding successions are part of the basal Collier Group or a succession deposited between the Edmund and Collier Groups. The third alternative is consistent with geological mapping, and the U and Th compositions of the grains, which places the rhyolite within the Edmund Group. Since the xenotime was not dated in situ, it is difficult to determine the petrogenetic context of these grains. It is possible that the xenotime grew within discrete hydrothermal veins or within patches of highly altered (K-metasomatized) rhyolite, rather than within the rhyolite matrix itself. Further investigation using in situ techniques will help resolve this issue. The c. 1235 Ma age for this possible period of hydrothermal alteration is coincident with low- to medium-metamorphic grade deformation and reworking of the underlying Gascoyne Province basement during the 1320-1170 Ma Mutherbukin Tectonic Event (Johnson et al., 2011). The c. 1030 Ma date from the rim is more straightforward to interpret and probably results from growth during another late stage hydrothermal event (Rasmussen et al., 2010). The date is within uncertainty of the Rb-Sr isochron of 1098 Â± 42 Ma obtained by Gee et al. (1976) from the Tangadee Rhyolite, who also argued that this dated a post-emplacement alteration event. The timing of alteration and hydrothermal xenotime growth is also coincident with a period of low- to medium-metamorphic grade deformation and reworking of the underlying Gascoyne Province basement during the 1030-955 Ma Edmundian Orogeny.",No,,,8,,No,Published,No,No,P_,MEkt,,,,,MIGSDSK,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

It consists of medium-grained, brick red syenite and quartz syenite, and leucocratic alkali-feldspar granite. The granite is believed to have formed due to chemical alteration of Archean granitic bedrock during the meteorite impact event that formed the Shoemaker impact crater. The medium-grained syenite phase of the Teague Granite has been dated at c. 2648 Ma.","The Teague Granite appears as scattered outcrops along the eastern edge of the central uplift area of the Shoemaker impact crater, about 105 km northeast of Wiluna on NABBERU.

The syenite is medium grained, brick red, and composed mainly of aegirine-augite, albite, and orthoclase. The medium-grained, brick red quartz syenite is composed of quartz, microcline, and albite, and contains a distinctive polygonal and granoblastic texture. The leucocratic alkali-feldspar granite is coarse to medium grained.  The Teague Granite is enriched in sodium, potassium, and rare earth elements (REEs), and is depleted in silica. This composition is most likely the result of alkali metasomatism (Pirajno et al., 2003; Pirajno, 2005) that took place during hydrothermal alteration of pre-existing Archean granite bedrock during the meteorite impact event. The granite is also fractured and contains jasperoidal pods and quartz veins.  Both, the syenite and quartz syenite have localized, narrow (<1 mm wide), dark-coloured pseudotachylite veins, composed of quartz and feldspar fragments set in a glassy matrix. These are thought to have formed by intense frictional melting when the crater was originally excavated (Pirajno, 2002).

The member consists of stromatolitic dolostone, dolomitic sandstone and siltstone with fine-grained quartzofeldspathic sandstone and siltstone interbeds. Symmetrical ripples are ubiquitous on exposed bedding surfaces commonly indicating oscillating bidirectional currents directed north-south and northwest-southeast. Desiccation cracks up to 1 cm thick are commonly superimposed on symmetrical ripples infilled by the overlying sandstone beds. The most distinctive features of this unit are the numerous morphologies of microbialite including stromatolites assigned to Kussoidella limata (Cloud and Semikhatov, 1969; Kath Grey, personal communication). The Teronis Member was deposited in a shallow marine to marginal marine setting from above fair weather wave base to supratidal conditions. Basin-wide preservation of fine-grained lithologies and subaerial conditions as seen at the base of the Elgee Siltstone may represent a major shallowing event and/or uplift across the whole exposed Kimberley Basin.",The Teronis Member crops out in the east Kimberley region in the Elgee Cliffs and Chamberlain River valley area - a set of northeast-trending exposures that parallel the Durack Range. The member has also been described from the Mueller Ranges in the southeast Kimberley region.,"The Teronis Member was named for outcrops near Teronis Gorge, located approximately 21 km east-southeast of Bedford Downs Homestead.",,"The Teronis Member consists of carbonate lithofacies as well as micaceous siltstones and shales with interbedded thin-bedded, fine-grained feldspathic sandstones. Microbialite and stromatolitic limestone and dolomite are described from the top of the member (Owen, 1970). The member thins to the north-northeast. In the Chamberlain River valley area the Teronis Member has been divided into four lithofacies by Owen (1970). In ascending order they are:  (1) feldspathic sandstone; (2) grey and green shale, siltstones, fine-grained sandstones, and oolitic dolostones; (3) interbedded brown and red siltstone, shale, and fine-grained sandstone; (4) interbedded grey and green siltstone, fine-grained sandstone, shale and microbial dolostone.  Sedimentary structures are abundant in the lower lithofacies, with symmetrical and asymmetrical ripples, cross-beds, flute clasts, desiccation cracks, raindrop imprints, and salt casts. The upper units contain abundant algal structures including numerous morphologies of stromatolite. Some of the stromatolites were broken up by repeated subaerial exposure and desiccation resulting in intra-formational microbial breccia (Owen, 1970).  Southeast of Yulumbu (Tableland) Homestead the Teronis Member consists of feldspathic sandstone, sandstone and siltstone, or sandstone and dolomitic siltstone. In sandstone-dominated lithofacies the member is a thin-bedded, quartz-rich subarkose; planar parallel laminated or rarely cross-laminated. In heterolithic packages the member consists of very fine-grained sandstone and dolomitic siltstone 8-10 cm thick. Both lithologies are flaggy. The siltstone is siltstone is purple, massive and fissile while interbedded sandstone units are dark blue, well-sorted, planar parallel laminated, very fine-grained quartz subarkose. Symmetrical ripples are common on upper bedding surfaces indicating oscillating currents directed north-south and northwest-southeast. Ripples are up to 8 cm crest-to-crest and up to 2 cm high. Desiccation cracks are also common and are commonly overprint symmetrical ripples. Flute casts are seen cross-cutting some desiccation cracks. Some heterolithic sandstone and dolomitic siltstone contain flaser bedding.","The Teronis Member records a deepening-upward cycle from outcrops in the Chamberlain River valley area. Very shallow water with frequent subaerial exposure is inferred from the desiccation cracks, raindrop imprints, and salt casts; probably an intertidal or possibly supratidal setting. There is evidence for deepening water column with the loss of subaerial indicators (desiccation cracks, raindrop imprints etc.) and a change to fully marine conditions with structures such as flute casts indicating an offshore/downslope paleocurrent direction to the southwest. Ripple laminations give variable paleoflows from north to southeast. These variations suggest that the Teronis Member was possibly deposited into an embayed coast (shoreline to the northeast) with the flute casts indicating bottom currents moving offshore to the southwest and ripple laminations probably generated by onshore currents and waves (Owen, 1970).  Stromatolites are useful for providing maximum water depths, restricted as they are to the photic zone (< 100 m water depth). The stromatolites/algal forms in the Teronis Member, however, with their intraformational breccias were most likely living on an intertidal flat on in isolated pools on a tidal plain exposed to frequent episodes of subaerial exposure, desiccation, and resulting brecciation.",,140,,The Teronis Member is a conformable on the Warton Sandstone in the east Kimberley where the member is seen to crop out.

(1983) as a unit of  alkaline anorthositic gneiss  based on partial whole-rock analyses of three samples. Sheppard and Farrell (2005) classed these rocks as aegerine-augite bearing metaleucogabbros, and presented major and trace element analyses of five samples. The rocks are dominated by plagioclase (An 10-30 ). However, they are rather unusual for mafic rocks because the plagioclase is quite sodic (An 10-30 ) and they contain  green clinopyroxene , in addition to abundant titanite (up to 5%), allanite, zircon, and xenotime. The rocks are reinterpreted as alkaline metamorphosed quartz diorite and metatonalite. The Tetlow Granite forms thin layers and lenses that are almost entirely restricted to inclusions within the Davey Well Granite that is present throughout the Mutherbukin Zone.","Aegirine-augite- or hornblende-bearing metamorphosed quartz diorite and minor metatonalite are largely confined to a southeasterly trending belt about 85 km long and about 10 km wide in the central part of the Gascoyne Province. Williams et al. (1983) noted that these alkaline rocks always form elongate bodies that are closely associated with large masses of foliated, coarsely porphyritic biotite monzogranite of the Davey Well Granite (P_-DUda-mgmu). However, there are no minerals in the Davey Well Granite indicative of alkaline affinity. The alkaline rocks form boudinaged lenses and layers about 20-300 m long and 2-25 m wide, commonly in concentrations of 2 to 10 km 2  in areal extent. The main concentrations are north of New Well and west of Tommie Well on EUDAMULLAH, and southwest of Yinnetharra Homestead and southeast of Mango Bore on YINNETHARRA. Metamorphosed alkaline quartz diorite, tonalite, and quartz anorthosite outcrop as knolls or low ridges. They are commonly difficult to distinguish from the surrounding monzogranite on aerial photographs. Many of the alkaline rocks have dirty grey weathered surfaces resembling those of calc-silicate rocks. ","The Tetlow Granite is named after Tetlow Well (Zone 50, MGA 407053E 7270056N) on western YINNETHARRA.",,"The aegirine-augite- or hornblende-bearing metamorphosed quartz diorite and metatonalite are medium- to coarse-grained, and range from metamorphosed quartz diorite through metatonalite (with 10-25% pyroxene and amphibole), to metamorphosed quartz-anorthosite (>90% plagioclase) in minor segregations. Plagioclase phenocrysts are preserved in places. Locally, the rocks contain magnetite crystals with a diameter of 5 to10 mm. The alkaline rocks commonly have a weak centimetre-scale compositional layering, defined by variations in the proportion of plagioclase to the mafic silicates and oxide minerals. A subtle compositional layering on the scale of a few metres is also present in some exposures. Aegirine-augite- or hornblende-bearing metamorphosed quartz diorite and minor metatonalite locally contain elongate inclusions of amphibolite and fine- to medium-grained, metamorphosed, mesocratic quartz diorite.  At one locality about 20 km east-northeast of the Eudamullah Homestead (Zone 50, MGA 377686E 7299747N), leucocratic metamorphosed quartz diorite, along with minor amphibolite and coarse-grained hornblendite, define a horizon about 3-4 m thick within metasedimentary schist and gneissic medium-grained monzogranite. The leucocratic metamorphosed quartz diorite contains a centimetre- to decimetre-scale crude banding defined by layers and lenses rich in hornblende. About 200 m to the north, a foliated leucocratic quartz diorite layer about 10 m thick (with locally abundant epidote), is bordered by a thin band of amphibolite.  Low-strain outcrops are uncommon. One such example is exposed at site SXSYIN007885 (Zone 50, MGA 428087E 7254588N), just over 7 km east-southeast of Mango Bore on YINNETHARRA. It comprises a layer of medium- to coarse-grained, foliated, leucocratic, metamorphosed quartz diorite within macrocrystic metamonzogranite. The leucocratic, metamorphosed quartz diorite has oval to round plagioclase macrocrysts with a texture very similar to that of the K-feldspar macrocrysts in the metamonzogranite. There are no clearly defined contacts between the two rock types.  The aegirine-augite- or hornblende-bearing metamorphosed quartz diorite, which is the most common rock type, comprises plagioclase (oligoclase to andesine), subordinate aegerine-augite or amphibole, and lesser amounts of quartz (5-12%), epidote, titanite, and allanite. Other minerals present include grossular, titanomagnetite, zircon, and apatite. Accessory allanite and zircon are present even in samples of amphibolite (metamorphosed gabbro). With an increase in quartz, some of the rocks grade into tonalitic compositions. Others contain less than 10% mafic minerals and classed as metamorphosed quartz anorthosites. Most of the rocks have an anhedral granular or granoblastic texture, but some samples (e.g. GSWA 183213; SXSEUD7000, Zone 50, MGA 381803E 7307454N) contain remnants of a subhedral granular igneous texture. In rocks with a granoblastic texture, aegerine-augite has straight grain boundaries with epidote and fine-grained titanite, and sharp boundaries with plagioclase. In some samples aegerine-augite forms oikocrysts with small inclusions of hornblende, quartz, and plagioclase. Amphibole ranges from hornblende to a sodic hornblende with deep bluish-green pleochroism. Epidote, titanite, and grossular may form fine-grained clots up to 10 mm in diameter with blebby quartz inclusions. Titanite, which constitutes about 1-5% of the rocks, forms idioblastic crystals (1-2 mm long) with blebby inclusions of quartz, and fine-grained xenoblastic crystals. Allanite is typically partly or completely altered and mantled by epidote or, less commonly, titanite. Titanomagnetite has straight grain boundaries adjacent to titanite and allanite.  The metamorphosed quartz diorite, at the relatively low-strain exposure at site SXSYIN007885, contains about 50% plagioclase (andesine), 15% quartz, and about 30% diopside and tremolite, with a few percent titanite and scattered altered allanite crystals. Microcline forms rare patches or inclusions in plagioclase. Most of the rock has a granoblastic texture, but there are some domains with a finer grain size and subgrain quartz development.",,,,,"The aegirine-augite- or hornblende-bearing metamorphosed quartz diorite and minor metatonalite, and surrounding metamonzogranite of the Davey Well Granite, were metamorphosed at amphibolite-facies conditions. All have the same moderate to strong tectonic foliation or L-tectonite fabric. Contacts between the metamorphosed alkaline rocks and metamonzogranite are typically tectonic. However, at one relatively low-strain locality 5.5 km northwest of New Well on EUDAMULLAH (SXSEUD6681, Zone 50, MGA 392922E 7297584N), field relationships suggest that the metamorphosed, alkaline, leucocratic quartz diorite is older than the monzogranite. Monzogranite apophyses in metamorphosed quartz diorite are finer grained and less porphyritic than the metamonzogranite away from the contact, and the margins of the metamorphosed quartz diorite are altered to epidote, whereas the adjacent metamonzogranite is fresh.",,17,,,,4,,,,1663,5,1663,5,"Metamorphosed, leucocratic, alkaline quartz diorite was sampled for SHRIMP U-Pb zircon geochronology from a 120 m-long layer about 6.7 km south-southeast of Davey Well on eastern EUDAMULLAH (SSXEUD6681, Zone 50, MGA 392922E 7297584N).

Some of these dykes contain abundant concentrations of rare earth elements (e.g. Bi, Be, Nb-Ta) and have been the subject of small-scale mining.","The Thirty Three Supersuite is known mainly from the Mutherbukin Zone, between the Ti Tree Shear Zone to the north and the Chalba Shear Zone to the south, in the central part of the Gascoyne Province. Elements of it may outcrop on either side of this zone, but in the absence of Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic tectonism, dykes and plutons of the supersuite are not readily distinguishable from late phases of the 1680-1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite.   The Thirty Three Supersuite comprises a belt of: foliated, leucocratic, muscovite(-tourmaline) metamonzogranite and foliated, leucocratic, biotite-muscovite(-tourmaline) metamonzogranite about 5 km wide and 50 km long on northern YINNETHARRA and southwestern MOUNT PHILLIPS; three granite plutons south of the Ti Tree Shear Zone between Louden Well on southwestern MOUNT PHILLIPS and Reid Well on the northern edge of YINNETHARRA; and widespread pegmatite dykes and sheets throughout the Mutherbukin Zone, particularly in a belt about 60 km long and up to 15 km wide from New Well on southeastern EUDAMULLAH southeast to near Mount James on southeastern YINNETHARRA. Two swarms of tourmaline-muscovite pegmatite dykes, each less than 15 km 2 , that intrude the Minnie Creek batholith on northwestern EUDAMULLAH are also assigned to the Thirty Three Supersuite.","The Thirty Three Supersuite is named after the Thirty Three River, which flows through the main pegmatite field and across one of the granite plutons.",,"The Thirty Three Supersuite comprises a range of rock types, most of which are leucocratic and carry primary muscovite and tourmaline. The most voluminous single rock type is a fine- to medium-grained, foliated, leucocratic, muscovite(-tourmaline) metamonzogranite or foliated, leucocratic, biotite-muscovite(-tourmaline) metamonzogranite. These rocks are intruded by three plutons composed of massive, leucocratic, equigranular, muscovite-tourmaline(-biotite) monzogranite and granodiorite, and porphyritic biotite(-muscovite-tourmaline) monzogranite. The porphyritic monzogranite is medium grained with 5-15% round K-feldspar phenocrysts up to 2 cm in diameter (locally these may reach 4 cm). Tourmaline may be disseminated through the granite, or form splays or clots with bleached haloes. Pegmatites range from veins through dykes up to 10 or 20 m wide, to shallowly dipping sheets which may reach 200 m in thickness. The dykes and sheets are typically zoned, and contain cores of massive quartz. Many of these pegmatites contain rare elements (e.g. Bi, Be, Nb-Ta) and have been the subject of small-scale mining.",,,,,"Granites and pegmatites of the Thirty Three Supersuite intrude numerous units of the 1840-1810 Ma Leake Spring Metamorphics (P_-LS-xmd-mk), 1760-1680 Ma Pooranoo Metamorphics (P_-PO-md), 1680-1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite (P_-DU-g), and at least one unit of the 1820-1775 Ma Moorarie Supersuite. Despite the early Neoproterozoic age of the supersuite, none of the granites and pegmatites is known to intrude Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Edmund and Collier Groups. Components of the Thirty Three Supersuite are intruded by dykes of the c. 755 Ma Mundine Well Dolerite (P_-_mw-od).",,17,,,,8,,,,995,,939,5,"Two samples of rare-element pegmatite from the Thirty Three Supersuite have yielded SHRIMP U-Pb ages that constrain the age of crystallization.  One sample was taken from the blocky K-feldspar zone of a rare-element pegmatite at Bismuth Hill on northwestern MOUNT PHILLIPS (SXSYIN007191, Zone 50, MGA 405963E 7288621N; sample UWA 117154 (Trautman, 1992)). Seven analyses of a coarse monazite crystal from the pegmatite produced a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 954 Â± 12 Ma (Sheppard et al., 2007).   The other sample is also a rare-element pegmatite (GSWA 190667), collected ~3 km south-southwest of Camel Hill on northwestern YINNETHARRA. U-Pb dating of magmatic zircon grains indicates crystallization of the pegmatite at 939 Â± 3 Ma (Wingate et al., 2011), as well as a host of inherited zircon grains which are as old as c. 2252 Ma.  It is inferred that other pegmatites and granites of the supersuite, which have the same field relationships as the dated pegmatites (namely, they intrude across metamorphic and structural fabrics dated at 1030-995 Ma), are also early Neoproterozoic in age. Two leucocratic granites with the same field relationships as the pegmatites (GSWA samples 183287 and 183288) were dated. Analytical results from both samples are interpreted to date inherited zircons only (Kirkland et al., 2009; GSWA, unpublished data).   The two dated samples of pegmatite provide an age range of 955-939 Ma. Intrusion of the pegmatites (P_-TT-gvpt), as well as other tourmaline-bearing monzogranites (P_-TT-gmlt and P_-TT-gmpt) of the supersuite, postdate D 3e  deformation of the Edmundian Orogeny. However, leucocratic, inclusion-rich metamonzogranites of the supersuite (P_-TT-jmgmt-m) are deformed, implying intrusion before or during D 3e  deformation. Thus, the best constraint for the maximum age of magmatism in the supersuite is c. 995 Ma (Sheppard et al., 2007). The only robust constraint for the minimum age is provided from undeformed, crosscutting dolerite dykes of the Mundine Well Dolerite dated at c. 755 Ma (Wingate and Giddings, 2000). Therefore the age range of the supersuite is tentatively given to be 995-939 Ma.",No,,,269,,No,Published,Yes,Yes,P_,TT,,13,1,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,Yes,No

Martin et al. (1998) documented Fe-enriched BIF clasts that constrain the timing of microplaty hematite enrichment in the underlying Hamersley Group to before c. 2208 Ma.   Conglomerates can be divided into very thick-bedded conglomerate and inversely-graded conglomerate. The former occur in laterally continuous (>75 m) beds 4-17 m thick. Clast diameters are up to 0.45 m, but most are in the range 0.02 - 0.15 m. The conglomerates are predominantly clast supported, and rarely exhibit stratification other than localized, bedding-parallel orientation of the tabular clasts. Many thick-bedded conglomerates display a mixture of clast and matrix support, and bedding-parallel or random fabric. Locally, thicker conglomerate beds contain lenses of stratified, coarse-grained sandstone that have been slightly modified by soft-sediment deformation.   Inversely graded, thick-bedded (3-4 m) conglomerate crops out in laterally continuous beds with sharp, non-erosive bases. Grain size coarsens upwards, from a granule or, rarely, sandy conglomerate, to cobble conglomerate with an average maximum clast size of 0.1 m.

Geographically divided in to two sections, the section north of Coolgardie is differentiated and comprises a leucogabbro closely associated with gold mineralization. The southern section, located to the south of Coolgardie, lacks internal differentiation and gold mineralization is along the western margin of the sill with the Lindsays Basalt and black thin shales.

The first area extending northward from Three Mile Hill Mine site (MGA zone 51, 327745E, 6576289N) around the north extent of the Calooli Monzogranite. The second area is approximately 600 metres north of the Coolgardie Township and extends southward along the eastern limb of the Big Blow Anticline.","The name is derived from the Three Mile Hill opencut. Historically the unit has been referred to as a dolerite, which has been incorporated into the name. However, texturally the unit is predominantly gabbroic.",,"The Three Mile Dolerite is a dolerite to gabbroic sill up to 800 metres thick, and can be divided into two sections. The section north of Three Mile Hill mine site is 500-800 m thick, and comprises a differentiated gabbro to dolerite with a graduation from coarse-grained, melanocratic pyroxene to leucocratic (quartzo-) feldspathic horizons that contain scattered bladed pyroxenes. This variation is interpreted as crystal differentiation and can be used to determine younging. The leucogabbro varies in grain size from fine to very coarse. Repetition of the compositional layering occurs on a broad scale, with two or three cycles being common and may be due to magmatic process, but in some outcrops the repetition can be attributed to tectonic processes (Hunter 1993).   Several authors (Middleton, 1990; Knight et al., 1996; Jeffeys, 1998) have subdivided the northern section of the sill into four mappable units (G1-G4). These units range from cumulate pyroxene melanocratic gabbro to a quartz rich granophyric leucogabbro with a subophitic texture. The leucogabbro is closely associated with gold mineralization. Open cuts where the differentiated sill is exposed include deposits at Caledonia, Patricia Jean, Three Mile Hill, and Mystery Mint.   The southern section of the sill, located on the northern hinge and eastern limb of the Big Blow Anticline is much thinner attaining thicknesses of approximately 150-380m. There is little or no internal differentiation and mineralisation is at the western contact with the Lindays Basalt and intercalated thin shale units. The Lindsays opencut provides access to the exposed undifferentiated sill.   A comprehensive description of the Three Mile Dolerite was provided by Hunter (1993) and parts of that summary are presented in the following description. The gabbro is generally massive or weakly foliated but is locally strongly foliated. The deformation is commonly confined to zones, up to 2 m wide, of amphibole schists which correspond to competency contrasts at the boundaries between layers. There are vertical and lateral variations from ophitic to intergranular textures, the former being predominant in coarser horizons and producing a characteristic mottled appearance. Original platy pyroxenes are replaced by single or matted amphibole crystals which invariably define a strong, upright lineation. In thin section, samples from areas of low strain exhibit good preservation of igneous textures, and original large (< 10 mm), equant, subophitic to ophitic plates of pyroxene, enclosing blades of plagioclase, persist. Compositionally, the sill ranges from a basal coarse-grained, melanocratic pyroxenite, containing some plagioclase, to a medium-grained, mesocratic to leucocratic, gabbroic-textured top. Upper marginal zones may be chilled or coarse-grained and more mafic, indicating the presence of inward, as well as upward, differentiation. In the gabbro, low to middle amphibolite facies metamorphism has produced randomly oriented, single crystal amphibole pseudomorphs after pyroxene plates. Amphibole varies unsystematically throughout the area from a pale-green actinolitic variety to an olive-green hornblendic variety. Granoblastic recrystallization of plagioclase has produced coarse mosaics of andesine with polygonal to interlobate forms which are confined within the bladed forms of the protocrysts. Other minerals present in the gabbro include quartz, chlorite, clinozoisite, magnetite, sphene, apatite, secondary biotite and calcite. Knight et al., (1996) also mentions rare euhedral garnet in medium to coarse-grained melanocratic zones of the gabbro.   Representative geochemical analyses from throughout the gabbro indicate a tholeiitic signature. Anhydrous SiO2 ranges from 48.6 wt% to 64.81 wt % in the more granophyric zones. Total iron oxide (FeO*) average is 16.12wt%. High TiO2 (up to 17 wt %) is associated with ubiquitous ilmenite. Chondrite normalised patterns (after Sun &amp; McDonough, 1989) of samples throughout the sill have a very flat rare earth trend. Standing (2001) confirmed the geochemical similarities between the southern and northern sections by comparing a sample from the undifferentiated section of the sill from the Lindsays opencut with a chilled margin of the differentiated northern section at Three Mile Hill Mine. Knight et al., (1996) estimated the peak metamorphic pressure and temperature in the vicinity of the Three Mile Hill deposit to be in the range of 490-530&deg;C, and 3-4 kbar, respectively.    Late deformation has had a variable effect on the gabbro, from minor strain to spaced zones of high strain or shear. Minor strain appears as patchy or wavy extinction within platy amphiboles, and some local rotation of the plates. There has been crystallization of fine euhedra of similar amphibole in parallel trains both across earlier amphibole plates and, more abundantly, throughout feldspathic zones, along with microgranulation of small areas of feldspar. In contrast, major strain appears as strong rotation of amphibole plates and recrystallization of single plates to a mass of small spindle-shaped crystals with similar, but discordant (sweeping), optic orientations. General granulation of plagioclase crystals has obscured their original bladed form, while an indent to  pyroxene  plates have closed and a sieve texture has been generated. Feldspathic and fine amphibole phases are wrapped around platy amphibole domains. There is local overprint of a sparse growth of possibly cummingtonite which appears to be associated with tourmalinization.    The boundary between the gabbro sill and the country rock basalt may be marked by a black to grey coloured shale horizon which is often several metres thick. The shale horizons are more common along the margins of the southern sill, where there is known gold mineralization. ",,,800,,"Where there is minor stain development the upper contact with the Lindsays basalt is a chilled margin, with a general concordance to the regional stratigraphic layering. More commonly the contacts are sheared and interleaved with the Lindsays Basalt. Long (> 10 m), thin (up to 1 m) screens of basalt or interflow shale horizons commonly occur up to 10 m within the intrusion. The lower margin of the sill is more variable in character and is poorly exposed (Hunter 1993).",,17,,,,4,,,,2680,,2680,,No isotopic dating has been undertaken.,No,,,6,,No,Submitted,No,No,A,GBtm,,,,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,,No,No

Assemblages can vary from Na-bearing hornblende-plagioclase-magnetite-garnet-pyrrhotite Â± biotite, carbonate and quartz, to Actinolite-plagioclase-magnetite-quartz Â± biotite and carbonate. Knight et al. (1993) ascribe the gold mineralisation events in the Coolgardie region to ductile to brittle structures associated with deformation events D2 to D4, not unlike the deformation event as listed by Swager (1989) and Swager et al. (1992). The non-garnetiferous diorite is the more favourable host to auriferous mineralisation. There have been a range of lithological names for the Tindals Diorites which have included, aplite, porphyry, metasomatized leucogabbro, felsite and albite porphyry (McCormick and Hanna, 1990).   Knight et al. (1993) describe the principal alteration assemblage of the gold bearing diorites as hornblende-plagioclase (An1-An30)-calcite-quartz-chlorite-biotite-garnet. Sulphide minerals are predominately described as pyrrhotite, pyrite, sphalerite with trace galena and arsenopyrite. Other rare minerals included scheelite and ilmenite.    Geochemically, SiO2 ranges from 54-61wt% and total iron (as Fe2O3) from 6.7-15.1 wt%. The average Na2O of the least altered samples is ~4 wt%, but metasomatized samples can be up to 7-8 wt%. The diorites show a LREE enrichment trend relative to primitive mantle (Sun and McDonough, 1989). ",,,60,,"The diorites are sill-like with an apparent concordant relationship to the regional stratigraphy, but at the outcrop scale show discordance. The diorites are folded with a NNW-trending to north-trending fold axes, indicating that intrusion was prior to the D2 event of Swager (1997). Late stage brittle sinistral and dextral faults off-set the sills and gold bearing loads. Shearing along the contacts with host rocks has produced a lens-like shape along the strike of the sills. Where there is no shearing there is a clear intrusive relationship and a fine-grained margin to the diorites.",,17,,,,4,,,,2698,6,2698,6,"The tight upright NNW-trending to north-trending folding of the diorites indicates that they must have been intruded prior to D2 (after Swager, 1997; Blewett et al., 2010) which is interpreted to have initiated at approximately 2665 Ma in the western portion of the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane.   Preliminary U-Pb SHRIMP results on zircons from the tonalite (GSWA 204190) indicate a minimum age of crystallisation of 2698 Â± 6 Ma. There is some Pb-loss to all the zircons.

3060,75926,A-_tb-xs-c,1,Tobin Formation,1,"Wacke, lithic sandstone, siltstone, abundant chert and banded iron-formation, and minor felsic volcaniclastic rocks; metamorphosed","The Tobin Formation of the Yamarna Terrane in the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane of the Yilgarn Craton (Pawley et al., 2012) is a deformed and metamorphosed sedimentary succession that grades from a psammite-dominated package, which may include volcanic-derived detritus, to a heterogeneous succession that includes wake, fine-grained conglomerate and sandstone, and then to siltstone, mudstone and chert.   The Tobin Formation is the youngest exposed unit of the Yamarna - Mount Gill greenstone belt, and has been deposited on the felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of Toppin Hill Formation (A-_tp-xf-s). A SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age on detrital zircons in psammitic schist indicates a maximum deposition age of c. 2686 Ma (GSWA 182314, Wingate et al., 2012) but a single zircon from the sample allows the possibility that it is 2663 Â± 11 Ma.   Mudstones exposed east of Birthday Bore (Zone 51, MGA 567241E 6882198N) and west of Tobin Hill (Zone 51, MGA 573527E 6882583N) in the central part of the Yamarna - Mount Gill greenstone belt form the uppermost part of the Tobin Formation, and possibly the youngest exposures in the greenstone belt.   Although strongly deformed, metamorphic grade in the Tobin Formation is low (typically greenschist facies).  The succession is interpreted to have been deposited by turbidity currents. Rocks are similar in character to the so-called  late-basin  successions of the Eastern Goldfields (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2000; Squire et al., 2010). ","Metasedimentary rocks of the Tobin Formation are exposed in the central part of the southeasterly trending Yamarna - Mount Gill greenstone belt. The formation has been interpreted as two lobes: a northern lobe on YAMARNA and DOROTHY HILLS, and a southern lobe on TOPPIN and RASON. Where outcropping, it forms small knobs and hills, or patchy, isolated outcrop on flats.  The northern lobe of the Tobin Formation is interpreted from just south of the Great Central Road, seven kilometres east of the Mount Shenton - Yamarna turnoff (Zone 51, MGA 557618E 6909600N) on YAMARNA, to six kilometres north of Mount Fleming (Zone 51, MGA 577524E 6861638N) on DOROTHY HILLS, possibly continuing south beneath the cover Permian Patterson Formation (CP-_pa-sepg). At the northern end of the interpreted distribution, the exposure is poor and the extent of the unit is based on mineral-exploration drillhole data, and interpreted from aeromagnetic imagery. In the southern lobe, on the eastern side of TOPPIN and the western side of RASON, in the vicinity of Toppin Hill (Zone51, MGA 573515E 6882585N) in the southern part of the Yamarna - Mount Gill greenstone belt, rocks similar to those around Tobin Hill have been identified in mineral-exploration drillholes and assigned to the Tobin Formation.  The best exposure of the Tobin Formation is in the central part of the Yamarna - Mount Gill greenstone belt between Tobin Hill to the east (Zone51, MGA 593380E 6822617N) and Central Bore to the west (Zone 51, MGA 569406E 6885817N).  ","The Tobin Formation is named after Tobin Hill (Zone51, MGA 573515E 6882585N) in the central part of DOROTHY HILLS. Tobin Hill is east of the best exposed part of the formation, and is the closest named landmark.  The type section for the Tobin Formation is in the area of relatively good exposure west of Tobin Hill across a folded exposure of the formation. At the eastern end (SSRDHS000039, Zone 51, MGA 572465E 6882631N), weakly foliated psammites contain volcaniclastic detritus including small feldspar porphyroclasts. To the west, across a plain with several small ridges, one of the ridges (SSRDHS000024, Zone 51, MGA 572330E 6882387N) marks the contact between a siliciclastic metasedimentary succession of pelite and psammite, and a two-metre thick, jaspilite-bearing banded iron-formation and chert unit. Farther west, there is a heterogeneous succession of possibly volcaniclastic layers and chert-bearing, fine-grained metasedimentary layers (SSRDHS000019, Zone 51, MGA 572150E 6882022N). Chert layers are complexly folded with isoclinal and intrafolial folds. Immediately to the west, graded bedding in the psammite-pelite succession suggest local younging to the east. Farther west, the outcrop is sparse and a small outcrop of tonalitic rock and a fine-grained schist containing feldspar and biotite mark the end of the type section (CFGTHR000712, Zone 51, MGA 571790E 6882106N).  ",,"The Tobin Formation of the Yamarna Terrane is a heterogeneous succession of fine- to medium-grained metasedimentary rocks that includes sandstone, mudstone, siltstones, wacke, minor felsic volcaniclastic rocks, and chemical sedimentary rocks.   The lower part of the Tobin Formation is a sedimentary package ranging from psammite to pelite, including volcaniclastic interlayers that contain small, porphyroclastic feldspar laths. In the central part of the Yamarna - Mount Gill greenstone belt, a sequence, up to 200 m thick, of metamorphosed, pale conglomerate (clasts <3 cm), sandstone and grey mudstone form the top part of the formation. The thickness of individual beds ranges from one to ten centimetres. Locally preserved graded bedding is not a reliable younging indicator due to widespread, intense folding and shearing, with many small-scale s- and z-folds. Jaspilite-bearing banded iron-formation forms the uppermost unit of the Tobin Formation and is well exposed southeast of Central Bore on DOROTHY HILLS (CFGTHR000715, Zone 51, MGA 572392E 6882243N).  The Tobin Formation has undergone low-grade metamorphism (mainly greenschist facies) and primary bedding and textures are preserved, even where beds are intensively folded and sheared.   ","The Tobin Formation was deposited in a variably high-energy environment, and may represent turbidite deposits.

This latter age is similar to that commonly obtained for the maximum depositional age for 'late basin' successions in the western part of the Eastern Goldfields Superterrane (Kositcin et al., 2008). Felsic volcanic rocks in the underlying Toppin Hill Formation (A-_tp-xf-s) have been dated at 2677 Â±7 Ma (GSWA 183150, Wingate et al., 2011).

It is one of the largest mafic intrusions in the Lamboo Complex. The extent of the intrusion is very well defined on pseudocolour composite K/Th/U spectrometric images. On aerial photographs and LANDSAT images the intrusion has a circular structure, but this does not correspond to any lithological variations.

Biotite has a grainsize similar to other silicates in the rock, suggesting that its formation was late magmatic or subsolidus in origin, rather than a product of a later alteration event. Quartz comprises more than 5% of some samples and it is associated with limited replacement of pyroxenes by a green hornblende.

The Blackstone syncline extends eastwards under cover onto the western edge of BELL ROCK, and may also extend under cover to the west-southwest, possibly providing a direct link with other Bentley Supergroup units exposed within the Mount Palgrave - Barrow Range region (MOUNT EVELINE). The rocks of the Tollu Group unconformably overlie rocks of the Musgrave Province, mainly within the Mamutjarra Zone. The group comprises two formations: the rhyolitic and dacitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, breccia-sandstones, and laminated sandstones to siltstones of the Smoke Hill Volcanics; and andesitic to trachyitic lava flows, pebble breccias, and laminated volcanic siltstones and subordinate sandstones of the overlying Hogarth Formation. The base of the Tollu Group rests directly on c. 1075 Ma rocks belonging to the layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions (Blackstone and Cavenagh intrusions; P_-WKG) of the Giles Suite (Warakurna Supersuite), which were uplifted and eroded prior to deposition of the Tollu Group between c. 1072 and c. 1026 Ma.","Outcrop of the Tollu Group is almost entirely restricted to the east-trending, synclinal structure (Blackstone syncline) defining the preserved extent of the Blackstone Sub-Basin in the north of BLACKSTONE, but probably extends eastwards under cover onto the western edge of BELL ROCK. Recent mapping on COOPER also suggests that the Tollu Group may extend under cover to the west-southwest, possibly providing a direct link between the Blackstone Sub-Basin and other units of the Bentley Supergroup exposed within the Mount Palgrave - Barrow Range region (MOUNT EVELINE).","The name for the group is derived from the Tollu copper mine in the northeastern part of BLACKSTONE, approximately 11.5 km east of Smoke Hill and 13 km northwest of Murrawarrawarra Hill (Daniels, 1974).",,"The Tollu Group has been subdivided into the Smoke Hill Volcanics and overlying Hogarth Formation (Daniels, 1974; Smithies et al., 2009). The Smoke Hill Volcanics is dominated by porphyritic rhyolite and dacite, occurring as lavas, sills, and cryptodomes. Volcaniclastic deposits are locally common, and include breccia-sandstone and laminated sandstones to siltstones. Some volcaniclastic units are interpreted as rheoignimbrites. Intrusive and extrusive rocks are locally flow-banded, amygdaloidal, or spherulitic; lavas also show hyaloclastite breccias, indicating subaqueous deposition.  The overlying Hogarth Formation comprises andesitic to trachyitic lava flows. The dominant unit consists of variolitic andesitic to trachyitic lava, but acicular- and comb-textured andesitic to trachyitic lavas also occur.

In addition, dykes geochemically identical to lavas seen in the Hogarth Formation cut the layering within the layered mafic Cavenagh intrusion (P_-WKG-o) to the south. These relationships indicate a significant time gap between the deposition of the Kunmarnara Group (which pre-dates, and was intruded by, P_-WKG layered mafic intrusions) and the eruption of the Smoke Hill Volcanics. During that time gap, the layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions were emplaced within the Mummawarrawarra Basalt (Kunmarnara Group), and the whole package was uplifted, eroded, and possibly folded.

(1996) from an outcrop identified as rhyolite of the Smoke Hill Volcanics. Re-examination of that outcrop (Smithies et al., 2009) indicated that the rock is a fine- to medium-grained leucogranite, petrographically and texturally identical to a c. 1075 Ma leucogranite of the Warakurna Supersuite (P_-WK-g), and therefore not part of the Tollu Group.  Volcanic rocks at the base of the Tollu Group (Smoke Hill Volcanics) directly overlie the c. 1075 Ma layered mafic Blackstone intrusion (P_-WKG). Dating of a vitric dacite sample collected from the upper part of the Smoke Hill Volcanics, and on the northern limb of the Blackstone syncline (on BLACKSTONE), gave a crystallization age of 1026 Â± 26 Ma (GSWA 187177, Kirkland et al., 2010). However, a series of olivine gabbros, olivine norites, ferronorites, and ferrodiorites (Alcurra Dolerite, P_-WKal; previously P_-WKg3), which intruded into the Smoke Hill Volcanics in the western part of the Blackstone syncline, and similar rocks to the west (COOPER and FINLAYSON), have been dated at c. 1067 Ma (Seat, 2008; Howard et al., 2009). This requires at least some rocks within the Smoke Hill Volcanics to have been deposited before c. 1067 Ma. Indeed, two rhyolite samples obtained from around Mount Jane (northeastern BLACKSTONE) in the east of the Blackstone syncline, have given ages of 1071 Â± 8 Ma (GSWA 191728, Coleman et al., 2010a) and 1073 Â± 7 Ma (GSWA 191706, Coleman et al., 2010b). It is most likely that the 1026 Â± 26 Ma dacite represents a subvolcanic sill younger than the Smoke Hill Volcanics (either belonging to the Hogarth Formation, or younger units), and instead provides a minimum crystallization age for the whole Tollu Group.

The Frere Formation, a unit of intercalated siltstone and iron formation that overlies both the Yelma Formation and Sweetwaters Well Dolomite, was previously assigned to the Tooloo Group, but the recognition of a 50 to 80 Ma hiatus between it and the lower two units (Sheppard et al., 2016) has led to its exclusion (Occhipinti et al., 2017). The group rests non-conformably on Archean rocks of the Yilgarn Craton.  The Tooloo Group was deposited between 1950 to 1990 Ma, during the Glenburgh Orogeny, which contributed some detrital material to it, unlike the remainder of the Earaheedy Basin succession (Matonia, 2009; Rasmussen et al, 2012; Sheppard et al., 2016; Occhipinti et al., 2017). Mineralization of the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite took place at c.1815 Ma (Muhling et al., 2012), possibly during fluid flow associated with deformation of the entire basin at the start of the Capricorn Orogeny.","The Tooloo Group rims the present synclinal outcrop of the Earaheedy Basin, with a gently folded to unfolded southern synclinal arm, and a moderately to highly deformed northern arm. Outliers of probable Yelma Formation extend a few tens of kilometres onto the Yilgarn Craton. Virtually undeformed exposures are present locally at the very northern edge of the exposed basin, for example south of the Yibbie Range on southwest BEYONDIE (shown as Wonyulgunna Sandstone, P_Mw(s), on BULLEN 1:250 000 sheet), and in a few isolated outcrops north of Scorpion Bore on northern RHODES and southern BLAKE, and north of Coonabildie Bluff on COONABILDIE.","The Tooloo Group ( P_ET-xsf-kd ) was formally named, as the Tooloo Subgroup of the Earaheedy Group, by Hall et al. (1978) after Tooloo Bluff, a prominent north-facing hill in the upper Frere Formation on southern WINDIDDA 1:100 000 sheet. Since then, the subgroups of the Earaheedy Group, the Tooloo and Miningarra, have been raised to group status and the Earaheedy Group abandoned, after further geochronology and reassessment of a conglomerate at the base of the Chiall Formation ( P_EMc-sgi ) in the Kepaltin Pool area on WONGAWOL (Sheppard et al., 2016, Occhipinti et al., 2017). Originally interpreted as a local intraclastic conglomerate (Bunting, 1986; Jones et al., 2000, Pirajno et al., 2004, 2009), it is now recognized that the conglomerate may mark a significant hiatus. The name Tooloo Group was used, but not explained, by Pufahl et al. (2015) and Martin et al. (2015, 2016), in anticipation of the revised terminology set out here and by Occhipinti et al. (2017). The Tooloo Group contains the Yelma Formation and Sweetwaters Dolomite; the overlying Frere Formation was previously the core part of the group but is now excluded following recognition of a significant hiatus between it and underlying units.",,"The Tooloo Group consists of two main lithofacies: siliciclastic sandstone and siltstone with lesser conglomerate, and dolomitised stromatolitic carbonates with lesser siltstone and evaporitic carbonates, now largely silicified in outcrop. The first is characteristic of the Yelma Formation, the second of the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite. Discontinuous carbonate intervals are present in the Yelma Formation, mostly in its upper part, and are interpreted as intercalations of Sweetwaters Well Dolomite facies. Corresponding silty siliciclastic intervals in the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite are probably intercalations of Yelma Formation facies. Conglomerates are present in the far west, in the Yadgimurrin Member of the Yelma Formation, within the Yelma Formation on METHWIN (where it is much thicker and coarser grained overall than along the southern basin rim), and as basal lenses and stringers along the southern basin margin. Sub-economic MVT-style base metal mineralization is present in the upper Sweetwaters Well Dolomite along the southwestern margin of the basin in the Frere Range, and was dated at c. 1815 Ma by Muhling et al. (2012). Economic lead oxide mineralization is present in an outlier of highly weathered Sweetwaters Well Dolomite at the Magellan deposit, about 30 km west of Wiluna (Pirajno and Burlow, 2009).   The granular iron formation of the Frere Formation, which previously could have been considered the characteristic feature of the Tooloo Group, is now excluded from the group after the recognition of a significant disconformity between the Frere Formation and underlying units by Sheppard et al. (2016).","The Tooloo Group was deposited mostly in nearshore to coastal conditions, in both siliciclastic and carbonate settings. Terrigenous influx in general diminished upwards and westwards, in that the dolomitic Sweetwaters Dolomite generally overlies the siliciclastic Yelma Formation, but carbonate intercalations are locally present through the Yelma Formation, and silty intercalations through the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite. Evaporitic salinas developed in hypersaline coastal sabkas in the upper Sweetwaters Well Dolomite, adjacent to nearshore ramps on which stromatolites flourished.  Thin fluvial deposits are present in the basal Yelma Formation, and thick fluvially dominated deposits are present in the northern part of the preserved basin on METHWIN. These thick intervals may have developed in a localized incipient rift behind the foreland basin in which the contemporaneous Padbury Group was deposited (Sheppard et al., 2016; Occhipinti et al., 2017).",3,1300,,,,17,,,Mixed,2,,,,1990,6,1946,10,"The maximum age of the Tooloo Group is constrained by the age of the Imbin Porphry, dated at 1990 +/- 6 Ma by Nelson (2001), and now interpreted as equivalent to part of the lower Yelma Formation (Sheppard et al., 2016, Occhipinti et al., 2017).

(2016) later suggested that this might reflect fluid flow during deformation of the entire Earaheedy Basin succession rather than just the Yelma Formation. They favoured an age of 1946 +/- 10 Ma from thin tuffaceous layers in drill core from the uppermost &quot;Yelma Formation&quot; (here regarded as Sweetwaters Well Dolomite) as a minimum age constraint. Supporting this, Rasmussen et al. (2012) dated tuffaceous material in the immediately overlying basal Frere Formation as 1891 +/- 8 Ma.  The 1653 +/- 14.4 Ma age, from metamorphic mica in schist in dynamically metamorphosed Tooloo Group (Pirajno et al., 2009), previously considered a minimum constraint, is here attributed to deformation associated with the Mangaroon Orogeny to the west, and formation of the Scorpion and Edmund Basins. The Tooloo Group is also the only part of the Earaheedy Basin succession to contain detrital zircons with an age range of 2000 - 1970 Ma (Matonia, 2009), which Occhipinti et al. (2017) took to indicate detrital influx from the Glenburgh Orogeny to the west, although Sheppard et al.

Volcanic rocks range in composition from andesite to rhyolite, with dacite dominant. The proportion of volcaniclastic rocks increases in the upper part of the formation. The formation is underlain by an unassigned mafic volcanic succession, and overlain by clastic sedimentary rocks of the Tobin Formation (A-_tb-xs-c). Volcaniclastic rocks of the Toppin Hill Formation contain mafic xenoclasts, which decrease in size and abundance in the upper part of the formation.   Metamorphic grade in the Toppin Hill Formation ranges from greenschist to lower amphibolite facies. Rocks are commonly sheared and aligned parallel to the main greenstone belt trend. Strike-slip deformation is dominant and L>S fabric is preserved.   Dacite from the Toppin Hill Formation has been dated at 2677 Â± 7 Ma (GSWA 183150, Wingate et. al. 2011) but dates determined on other volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks indicate a complex geochronology age profile for the formation (see Geochronology). ","Metamorphosed felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic metasedimentary rocks of the Toppin Hill Formation are exposed in Yamarna - Mount Gill greenstone belt on DOROTHY HILLS and TOPPIN. Based on a combination of outcrop, and interpretation of mineral-exploration drillhole data and aeromagnetic imagery, the formation can be traced in two lobes along the length of the greenstone belt. The northern area is in the central part of the greenstone belt on DOROTHY HILLS in the Central Bore area (Zone 51, MGA 569226E 6885762N), while the southern area lies north and west of Toppin Hill (Zone 51, MGA 592077E 6824610N) on eastern TOPPIN. The most extensive outcrops are in the northern part, in the vicinity of Central Bore. Elsewhere outcrop is poor with southern area known mainly from mineral-exploration drillholes. Sedimentary rocks of the Paterson Formation (CP-_pa-sepg) overlie the formation in places.  The type section for the Toppin Hill Formation is about one kilometre south of Central Bore on DOROTHY HILLS, subparallel to the Anne Beadell Highway between SSRDHS000251 (Zone 51, MGA 566994E 6884795N) and SSRDHS000263 (Zone51 MGA 570890E 6884347N).

Felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks in a similar stratigraphic position in drillcore in the eastern part of TOPPIN, about 55 km to the southeast of the GSWA 18350 sample and along the same general greenstone trend, have also been assigned to the Toppin Hill Formation. Two samples from drillholes in this area have been dated. They include felsic volcaniclastic sandstone dated at 2682 Â± 5 Ma (Geoscience Australia 2004967500, Sircombe et al., 2007), giving a maximum depositional age, and meta-rhyolite rhyolite dated at 2698.7 Â± 4.8 Ma (Geoscience Australia 2004967506, Sircombe et al., 2007), which was interpreted as the magmatic age. The latter date was determined on a strongly altered and metamorphosed rock with a substantial discordant and/or high-common lead component that may indicate a younger magmatic age.

It is equivalent to the Pindyin Sandstone in South Australia. The Townsend Quartzite forms a prominent discontinuous ridge at the southern margin of the west Musgrave region. It is composed of fine- to coarse-grained sandstones with intercalated conglomeratic layers that were deposited in braided fluvial to nearshore marine environments. The contact with the underlying volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Bentley Supergroup appears in some areas structurally concordant but locally there is a clear low-angle unconformity. In outcrop, the Townsend Quartzite grades at the top into fine-grained siliciclastic rocks of the Lefroy Formation. The formation is overlain conformably by the Browne Formation in the subsurface, but is absent in Lancer 1, Empress 1A, Kanpa 1 and NJD 1, suggesting a prograding basal sandy facies may only have been deposited near active margins of the basin. The similarity of the basal sandstones across the Centralian Superbasin does suggest a common climatic control.","In the west Musgrave region the Townsend Quartzite forms a prominent discontinuous ridge in the Warburton area for a distance of about 110 km from the Brown Range and Townsend Ridges in the west to the Hocking Range in the east. The type section is located about 5.6 km east of Lilian Creek gorge (near Beal Outstation) (Daniels, 1974), where probably the stratigraphically lowest outcrops of the Townsend Quartzite can be found. Jackson and van de Graaff (1981) presented a reference section about 370 m thick at Ainslie Gorge at the southeastern edge of the Brown Range, where probably the stratigraphically highest parts of the Townsend Quartzite are exposed. Grigson (1982) and Watts (1982) measured a series of sections in the Townsend Ridges, the thickest of which is about 300 m. GSWA mapping in 2010 in the eastern part of the Townsend Ridges showed that the exposed thickness of the Townsend Quartzite reaches about 390 m in the area between Beal Outstation and Ranford Hill, including the type section area for which a thickness of 255.6 m was originally mentioned in Daniels (1974).   Farther east on COOPER, sandstone outcrops along the southern margin of the Musgrave region (Possum Hill, Livesay Range, Pirrilyunka Outstation area south of Skirmish Hill, and areas west and south of Mount Agnes) were mapped originally by Daniels (1974) as possible equivalents of the Townsend Quartzite. Later, some of these outcrops were tentatively assigned by Jackson &amp; van de Graaff (1981) to the Punkerri Sandstone. However, the local intercalations of silicified oolites, stromatolites and dolomites within these sandstones led Grey et al. (2005) to correlate the majority of these sandstone occurrences with higher stratigraphic parts of the Buldya Group. Grey et al. (2005) discussed the distribution and identity of outcrops assigned to the Townsend Quartzite in detail.  Further east in South Australia, the basal sandstone of the Officer Basin is mapped as Pindyin Sandstone (Jackson &amp; van de Graaff, 1981; Grey et al., 2005; Major, 1973; Zang 1995). ","The Townsend Quartzite was named after the Townsend Ridges by Soufoulis (1962), and formally defined by Jackson and van de Graaff (1981). Previous usage is  Townsend Range Series  (Horwitz, 1968),  Townsend Formation  (Gee, 1974) and  Townsend quartzite  (Preiss and Forbes, 1981). This unit is the basal sandstone of the Officer Basin succession in Western Australia, where the basin overlies Mesoproterozoic rocks of the Musgrave region. As discussed below, a series of unnamed quartz sandstone to quartzite units in the Officer Basin, mainly assigned to undifferentiated Proterozoic, may be Townsend Quartzite equivalents. Equally, some Townsend Quartzite as presently recognized may be older Mesoproterozoic sandstone rather than part of the Officer Basin succession.  Daniels (1974, table 6) referred to an 840 feet (256 m)-thick section 3&frac12; miles (5.6 km) east of Lilian Creek gorge (informal topographic name) in the Townsend Ridges as the type section, and gave descriptions of the section from unpublished work by R. A. Farbridge. Jackson and van de Graaff (1981, fig. 13) noted Daniels  section, and presented a reference section about 370 m thick in Ainslie Gorge. As far as can be determined, their section extends from a base at about MGA Zone 52 265700E 7095600N southward to the stratigraphically youngest exposure at 265200E 7095200N. In South Australia, the type section of the Pindyin Sandstone is at Pindyin Hills on LINDSAY (Major, 1973), and a reference section is in Giles 1, between 1289 and 1326.8 m (Morton, 1997).",,"The Townsend Quartzite consists predominantly of laminated to cross-bedded, poorly- to well-sorted, fine- to coarse-grained, in parts pebbly or conglomeratic, feldspathic and/or hematitic sandstones which are moderately to very strongly cemented by silica. In the type section area near Lilian Creek gorge and also at the reference section at Ainslie Gorge, as well as in the Hocking Range, the Townsend Quartzite succession can be subdivided into two major parts (Daniels, 1974; Jackson &amp; van de Graaff, 1981). The boundary between the lower and upper part appears as a distinct and sharp boundary in aerial and satellite images. More detailed work by Grigson (1982) and Watts (1982), as well as GSWA observations in 2010, showed that the lower part of the Townsend Quartzite can be subdivided further into three or four subunits.  The lowest exposures in the type section are reddish-brown, moderately sorted, often feldspathic and slightly micaceous, medium to thickly cross-bedded, fine- to coarse-grained sandstones. These form the majority of the lower north-facing cliff section. Mud pebble horizons are very common and isolated quartz pebbles also occur. Bed geometries of the cross-bedded sandstones are predominantly planar but channel bodies with a high width-thickness ratio are also present. These channels are mainly filled with purple-brown, slightly coarser grained, poorly sorted, mud-rich and pebbly sandstones. Additional subordinate facies are well-sorted, laminated, fine- to medium-grained sandstones with parting lineation on bedding surfaces and poorly sorted, coarse-grained, pebbly to conglomeratic sandstones. A variety of ripple marks, desiccation cracks and convolute bedding due to dewatering are also present. Outcrops of this facies are restricted to the central part of the eastern Townsend Ridges east of Beal outstation where they form a lower, smaller, discontinuous cliff section in front (north) of the main mountain ridge about 75 m thick.  The sandstones of the lower cliff section are overlain by a partly recessive succession of reddish-brown, fine- to medium-grained, well sorted, highly mature, non-pebbly sandstones about 90 m thick, characterized by  abundant wave ripple surfaces. This succession forms a slightly south-dipping, notch between the two steeper, north-facing cliff sections in the eastern Townsend Ridges. The sandstone is mostly laminated to planar-bedded but contains small channels of high width-thickness ratio filled with well-sorted, cross-bedded sandstone. Locally, sandstones show metre-sized soft sediment deformation structures like gentle folding due to minor slumping or sliding. Rare desiccation cracks were also observed.   These sandstones are overlain by a thin (<5 m?) marker layer of a very coarse, matrix-supported conglomerate characterized by very well rounded pebbles and cobbles with crescentic percussion marks. These pebbles and cobbles are predominantly composed of quartzitic sandstones and milky vein quartz and are embedded in a sandy matrix.   This conglomerate is overlain by a circa 75 m thick succession of light-coloured, silica-cemented, well-sorted, mainly medium-grained, non-pebbly, laminated to tabular cross-bedded sandstones forming the main part of the steep, north-facing, higher cliff section in the Townsend Ridges. Characteristic for these sandstones is the presence of cm-sized, silicified diagenetic nodules (former carbonate concretions?). The sandstones are medium to thickly bedded and planar bed geometries prevail. The combined exposed thickness of the lower part of the Townsend Quartzite is here at its type locality about 240 m.   The sandstones of the lower part of the Townsend Quartzite are sharply overlain by light-coloured, strongly silica-cemented, medium- to very coarse-grained, pebbly to cobbly, poorly sorted, mainly trough cross-bedded sandstones and intercalated conglomerate layers. The pebble and cobble clasts are subangular to well-rounded and predominantly composed of quartzitic sandstones and milky vein quartz. This circa 150 m thick sandstone-conglomerate succession represents the upper part of the Townsend Quartzite and forms the top section of the Townsend Ridges and its south-sloping parts.  ","The lower part of the Townsend Quartzite was deposited in shallow water environments ranging from braided fluvial to estuarine-tidal and beachface to nearshore (Daniels, 1974; Jackson &amp; van de Graaff, 1981; Grigson, 1982; Watts, 1982). The upper, coarser grained part of the Townsend Quartzite is the product of deposition in a braided fluvial setting on the distal portions of alluvial fans, where conglomerate layers were laid down by sheet- and flash-flood events (Grigson, 1982; Watts, 1982), rather than in a deeper non-emergent marine environment (Daniels, 1974) or as a deltaic intercalation in a littoral sequence (Jackson &amp; van de Graaff, 1981). At the very top, the apparent transition into the Lefroy Formation or Browne Formation reflects diminshed terrigenous influx combined with transgression (Jackson &amp; van de Graaff, 1981; Grey et al., 2005).",200,390,,"In the west on TALBOT, the Townsend Quartzite overlies mainly basalts and sandstones of the Mission Group, the youngest group of the Bentley Supergroup. However, the basal contact with the underlying rocks is nowhere exposed. In the westernmost outcrops, general parallelism of strike and dip of the Townsend Quartzite and the underlying Mission Group suggests that they are structurally concordant. Recent drilling in the Beal Outstation area (RWDD002 - Lilian Target; Eaton, 2010) revealed that the hematitic red-bed sandstone facies found in the lower unit of the Townsend Quartzite is also present in the uppermost unit of the Mission Group, namely the Milesia Formation, which is composed of hematitic sandstones and siltstones, interbedded with mafic volcanics. Farther east, in the region between Ranford Hill and Barrow Hill, the strike divergence between the Townsend Quartzite and underlying units of the Bentley Supergroup (Mission, Cassidy, and Pussy Cat Group) implies a low-angle unconformable contact (Daniels, 1974).   The present line of outcrops in the Townsend Ridges suggests that the Townsend Quartzite has been subjected to some form of folding which has not affected the underlying Mission Group (Daniels, 1974). Sofoulis (1962) and Daniels (1974) concluded that this implies the existence of a low angle thrust or d&eacute;collement at the base of the Townsend Quartzite and that the overlying beds have been folded independently of the Mission Group. This further implies that the apparent unconformity at the base of the Townsend Quartzite may be partly an erosional and partly a tectonic feature. Faulting of the Townsend Quartzite (e.g. in the Hocking Range) may also be related to the formation of a d&eacute;collement (Daniels, 1974). The question whether a depositional gap (e.g. erosional unconformity) exists between the Mission Group and the Townsend Quartzite or not is still unanswered. Furthermore, the age of the faulting and folding of the Townsend Quartzite remains speculative.  In the eastern part of the west Musgrave region, on COOPER, the Townsend Quartzite overlies lower units of the Bentley Supergroup, e.g. volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Kunmarnara Group (Evins et al., 2010), as well as older high-grade metamorphic crystalline rocks. The contact is nowhere exposed but Howard et al. (2011) interpreted it essentially tectonic in nature (thrust fault).   In South Australia, the Townsend Quartzite commonly overlies crystalline basement. However, recent seismic interpretations suggest that in certain areas it is underlain by unmetamorphosed Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks (Rodinia Oil, 2009), which may be correlatives of the Bentley Supergroup.  The upper contact of the Townsend Quartzite is only exposed in the Warburton area, at Ainslie Gorge, where the Townsend Quartzite is overlain by the Lefroy Formation. The contact is inferred to be gradational and conformable (Lowry et al., 1972; Daniels, 1974). Jackson &amp; van de Graaff (1981) reported that at Ainslie Gorge the contact between these two units is characterized by a transition zone of interbedded siltstone and fine-grained sandstone a few metres thick. In South Australia, the Pindyin Sandstone is conformably overlain by shales and evaporites of the Alinya Formation (Zang, 1995).  On the northern side of the Musgrave region, the potentially correlative Heavitree Formation and Dean Quartzite are overlain by the Bitter Springs Group, a correlative of the Browne Formation and probably the Alinya Formation. Facies comparable to the Lefroy Formation are not present. ",,17,,,,4,,,,1000,,800,,"Two samples of Townsend Quartzite (GSWA 189557, 195237) have been subject to detrital zircon dating, producing maximum depositional ages of 1102 Â± 34 Ma (1&sigma;) and 1097 Â± 102 Ma (1&sigma;), respectively, based on the youngest single dates (Wingate et al., 2017a,b). These ages are older than estimates based on other constraints which are considered more reliable indicators of the depositional age.   The following discussion is modified from Grey et al. (2005):  The age of the Townsend Quartzite is inferred from relative stratigraphic position, regional correlations based on biostratigraphy, and stable isotope analysis of overlying formations. Maximum age constraints are provided by dating of underlying Mesoproterozoic successions and dyke swarms that are both widespread and apparently pre-date either the Officer Basin succession or equivalent successions in the Adelaide Rift Complex and Centralian Superbasin.  Maximum age constraints are provided by the Bentley Supergroup (c. 1080-1060 Ma) and associated c. 1080-1050 Ma Stuart and Kulgera/Alcurra Dyke Swarms, which underlie the Townsend Quartzite (Grey et al., 2005). Further constraints may be provided by the Gairdner Dolerite (c. 827 Ma). The dykes of the Gairdner Dolerite are accepted as feeders for volcanic rocks at the base of the Neoproterozoic succession in the Adelaide Rift Complex (Mason et al., 1978) and were intruded during initial sedimentation (Preiss, 2000; Preiss, in Grey et al., 2005). If correlation across to the Adelaide Rift Complex is accepted, the Townsend Quartzite has a probable maximum age of about 830 Ma, and may be younger than 825 Ma.    Unnamed volcanic units intruding the Bitter Springs Group in the Amadeus Basin are possibly comagmatic with the Gairdner Dolerite (Walter et al., 2000). The Bitter Springs Group correlates with the Browne Formation, which from comparison with exposed successions in the northwest Officer and Amadeus Basins should overlie the Townsend Quartzite, so the Townsend Quartzite is slightly older than c. 825 Ma. Close et al. (2003) give an age of 850 Ma for the correlative Dean Quartzite on the northern margin of the Musgrave Complex, based on an age of 820 Ma for spilites that are present near the top of the overlying Bitter Springs Group (Close et al., 2003).  A minimum age of greater than 800 Ma can be inferred from biostratigraphic and stable isotopic correlations of the overlying Browne Formation with part of the Callanna Group of the Adelaide Rift Complex. The Rook Tuff, from near the top of the Callanna Group, overlies the Coominaree Dolomite (a Browne Formation equivalent) and has a U-Pb SHRIMP zircon age of 802 Â± 10 Ma (Fanning et al., 1986).",No,,,2,,No,PM Approved,No,No,P_,BUw,,,,,MIGSDHI,2.02E+13,,Yes,No

The latter is assumed to grade into the Browne Formation in the subsurface, although no indications of evaporites (which characterize the Browne Formation) are known from outcrop of the Lefroy Formation.

Measured sections vary in thickness from 110 to 370 m (Grey et al., 2005). It has not been intersected in any drillholes away from the basin margin. These ridges extend into South Australia, where they have previously been mapped as Pindyin Sandstone. In the northwestern Officer Basin, sandstone at the base of the Neoproterozoic sucession is included in the Skates Hills Formation, but contains scattered evaporite pseudomorphs that suggest correlation with the Browne or Lefroy Formations.  The Lefroy Formation is exposed on the southwest side of the Browne Range, where it is about 250 m thick. Exposures of probable evaporites in diapiric structures north of Pirrilyungka Outstation and in the Livesey Range are assigned to the Browne Formation rather than the Lefroy Formation. The equivalent section in South Australia is assigned to the lower Alinya Formation.","The Townsend Quartzite is named after the Townsend Ridges, and the Lefroy Formation after Point Lefroy.",,"The Townsend Quartzite consists of variably silicified quartz sandstone with lesser conglomerate and siltstone. The Lefroy Formation consists of white to purple-weathering, shaly argillaceous micaceous siltstone, with intercalations of medium- to thick-bedded quartz sandstone.

","The Traine Formatin is seen on the following 1:250 000 map sheets: MOUNT ELIZABETH, LENNARD RIVER, LANSDOWNE, CHARNLEY. It is exposed in low hills and knolls. ",The Traine Formatin is probably named after the Traine River area and the outcrops on a prominent scarp there (flowing between the Talbot and Warton Ranges on LANSDOWNE 1:250 000). ,,"The upper part of the formation is not preserved on MOUNT ELIZABETH 1:250 000 so the Traine Formatin consists of dark red shale coarsening upwards into a red or brown, fine-grained, flaggy or blocky, laminated sandstone (Roberts and Perry, 1970). In other areas the exposed Traine Formation is a green or brown, medium- to coarse-grained, massive lithic sandstone. East of Mount Clifton on MOUNT HOUSE 1:100 000 the Traine Formation is medium-grained, dolomitic, chloritic, and feldspathic sandstone with 2-3% apatite (Gellatly et al., 1969) and minor dolomitic breccia and pyrite pseudomorphs (Plumb, 1981). Minor sandy dolomite or dolomitic sandstone are also found interbedded with the lithic sandstones on CHARNLEY 1:250 000 (Gellatly et al., 1969). In the Mount Caroline area (MOUNT HOUSE 1:100 000) the Traine Formation has a basal thick-bedded, buff-coloured, lenticular dolomite with 9 m of massive lithic quartz-sandstone (Plumb, 1981). Scattered glacial erratics are found within the Traine Formation, sometimes consisting of boulders up to 2.5 m in diamter (Plumb, 1981; Griffin et al., 1993). A basal dolomitic breccia is seen in the Mount Caroline area, with a dolomitic sandy matrix (Plumb, 1981). ","Glaical outwash is suggested from the large ice-rafted boulders within the Traine Formation, possiblly into a shallow marine or fluvial system.

It mainly comprises mafic rocks, which include basalt and komatiitic basalt, with lenses of ultramafic schist and peridotite. Interbedded sandstone and siltstone are a minor component of the Trevors Bore Formation. A thin layer of mafic rocks in contact with granitic bodies between the Puzzle mine and Mount George has been metamorphosed to amphibolite. Lower part of the Trevors Bore Formation is intruded by granitic rocks. The Trevors Bore Formation and the overlying dominantly sedimentary Mount Leonora Formation underlie 2720-2680 Ma mafic-ultramafic rocks of the Marshall Pool Subgroup (Kalgoorlie Group) along a major unconformity.

It is composed of talc, chlorite, carbonate, and albite, with small amounts of magnetite, pyrite and biotite, and rare clinochlore (Stewart, 2004). The peridotite has been mapped as lenticular units within the ultramafic schist, which consists of amphibole after pyroxene, serpentine-talc-chlorite after olivine, carbonate, and magnesite. Relict cumulate texture is preserved locally in the peridotite. The amphibolite has been identified adjacent to granitic bodies between Balkan Well and the Jasper Hill mine. This metamorphosed mafic rock consists mainly of aligned amphibole and plagioclase with subordinate quartz and titanite. Basalt is the main component of the Trevors Bore Formation. It is commonly fine to very fine grained and consists of actinolite and plagioclase with small amounts of chlorite, epidote, clinozoisite, quartz, titanite, pyrite and other opaque minerals. Komatiitic basalt is exposed in lenticular units within the formation. It is composed mainly of actinolite-tremolite with subordinate plagioclase, epidote, and opaque minerals.

This suite includes porphyritic microgranites in greenstones near the town of Meekatharra (Van Kranendonk et al., 2013). Components of this suite lie within and adjacent to large-scale shear zones. Plutons that have intruded greenstone belts are typically subcircular, whereas plutons associated with large-scale shear zones are elongate and northerly trending, with an aspect ratio up to 10:1. Deformation conditions along these shear zones range from near-solidus temperatures down to mid-greenschist facies.","The Tuckanarra Suite of granitic rocks is distributed within and adjacent to large-scale shear zones in the western Yilgarn Craton. In map view, plutons intruded within greenstone belts are typically subcircular, for example the Karbar (A-TUkb-gm), Munarra (A-TUmu-gm) and Pirgan (A-TUpr-gm) Monzogranites. In contrast, plutons associated with large-scale shear zones are elongate and north-trending, with an aspect ratio up to 10:1. The best studied example is the Cundimurra Monzogranite (A-TUcu-mg), a north-trending pluton about 200 km long and up to 25 km wide, which is exposed between AUSTIN and BUNGAR.","The Tuckanarra Suite is named after Tuckanarra Hill (Zone 50, MGA 606702E 6994962N) on REEDY.",,"The majority of the Tuckanarra Suite consists of coarse-grained, K-feldspar-megacrystic, biotite metamonzogranite and equigranular monzogranite. Minor components include quartz diorite, tonalite, granodiorite and muscovite-bearing leucogranite. The minor components typically form dykes or small intrusions, which are commonly too small to be shown at 1:100 000 scale.   Subcircular plutons are typically weakly deformed to undeformed and may show a broadly concentric magmatic foliation and magmatic zoning. Near the intrusive contacts with host greenstones, these plutons commonly developed a weak to moderate solid-state overprint, manifested by a tectonic foliation parallel to the granite-greenstone interface. Host greenstones mainly consist of metabasalts of the Norie and Polelle Groups. Mafic schists commonly preserve upper greenschist and lower amphibolite facies assemblages, with the dominant assemblages actinolite- or hornblende-bearing, respectively.   Elongate plutons (e.g. Cundimurra Monzogranite) are spatially associated with large-scale shear zones (e.g. the Cundimurra Shear Zone). They are commonly sheeted and show a north-trending compositional layering that reflects their deformation-assisted incremental emplacement (Zibra et al., 2014). These elongate plutons were also the locus of intense subsolidus shearing during the mature stages of shear zone activity. Deformation conditions along these shear zones range from near-solidus temperatures down to mid-greenschist facies.  Deeply weathered and poorly exposed, foliated to mylonitic granitic rocks that are spatially associated with the Youanmi Shear Zone are also assigned to the Tuckanarra Suite.

Following reassessment of its age, no subsurface intersections are now recognized, but it correlates in age and lithofacies with the Kopke Sandstone, intersected by wells in the Shark Bay region. Four large-scale facies associations can be seen in the type section, which lies along the lower Murchison River, and form two major fining upwards couplets (FA1 and FA2, FA3 and FA4), with a fifth coarse-grained sandstone facies association (FA5) exposed above FA4 east of the Northampton Inlier. FA1, FA3 and FA5 are sheet-braided fluvial deposits that were in part coastally situated, as indicated by stratigraphically restricted bioturbation but no reworking by marine processes. FA2 formed in a tidal sandflat coastal setting, and FA4 in an interdistributary bay setting between major braided distributary lobes. Trewin and McNamara (1995) proposed a fully continental lacustrine setting for FA2, but this has not been accepted by any other workers.  The age of the Tumblagooda Sandstone was poorly constrained, with suggestions ranging from Late Cambrian to Silurian, based on various inferences. Poorly preserved plant debris were discovered in 2016, and establish its age as Early Devonian. Correlative units are now understood to include the Kopke Sandstone and Sweeney Mia Formation (Southern Carnarvon Basin, Shark Bay region), lower Beacon Supergroup (Antarctica), ?Mereenie Sandstone (Amadeus Basin), and Tandalgoo Sandstone (Canning Basin). Rocks previously placed in the Tumblagooda Sandstone in the Shark Bay region are now assigned to the Boolagoorda Sandstone. It predates Middle and Upper Devonian rocks exposed along the eastern basin margin, based on different lithology and its red-bed nature.","The Tumblagooda Sandstone is exposed along the lower Murchison River east and west of the Mesoproterozoic Northampton Inlier, along the coastal cliffs immediately south of Kalbarri, and in scattered outcrops further south on Ajana and Geraldton 1:250 000 sheets. It is now thought to correlate with the Kopke Sandstone and Sweeney Mia Formation from the Shark Bay region, based on a reassessed age. Rocks previously placed in the Tumblagooda Sandstone in that region are now assigned to a new unit, the Boolagoorda Sandstone.  ","The Tumblagooda Sandstone was named and first described by Clarke and Teichert (1948), after Tumblaggoda Hill, a prominent hill on the west bank of the Murchison River just north of the river mouth and present-day town of Kalbarri. It was promoted to Tumblagooda Group by Gorter et al (1994), but returned to formation status by Mory et al. (1998). Gorter et al. recognized 4 &ldquo;formations&rdquo; but did not name them. The Gabba Gabba Member was earlier named and described by Hocking (1991).  The type section follows the Murchison River, from the core of Hardabut Anticline (Zone 50J AMG 220300E 69144250N, base) down Murchison Gorge and the river valley to Second Gully, a north-side tributary of the lower Murchison River (224000E 6942700N). The uppermost facies are better exposed in Tumblagooda Hill (220300E 6935700N). Hocking (1991) remeasured the section as a series of partial sections, with correlation between sections largely from air photos. The total exposed thickness is about 1385 m, but the true stratigraphic thickness is about 1210 m, due to fault repetition.   A reference locality is along the Murchison River east of the Northampton Inlier, from ~283400E 6922550N to 283050E 6924700N. This section shows excellent exposures of FA3 and, along Pencell Pool, FA4. Very coarse-grained fluvial sandstone (FA5) sharply overlies FA4 at the north end of Pencell Pool, providing higher exposures than in the type section. Intermittent exposure continues downstream and upstream. FA2 is exposed in restricted exposures south of the river near South Jeffrey Bore on Riverside station (see Hocking, 1991, fig. 77).",,"The dominantly sandy facies of the Tumblagooda Sandstone imply high sediment influx, probably because of repeated uplift of the basin hinterland along marginal faults. About 1300 m deposited thickness of Tumblagooda Sandstone is exposed along the Murchison Gorge and in adjoining coastal cliffs and gorges, in a section within which dips decrease progressively from about 5&deg; near the Hardabut Fault westwards to near horizontal along the coastal cliffs. This section is divisible into four facies associations (FA1 to FA4), each of which occurs progressively higher up the gorge Together they form two sharp-based fining-upward megacycles of sheet-braided fluvial sandstone overlain by tidal sandflat deposits or coastal distributary and interdistributary bay deposits (FA1 to FA2, and FA3 to FA4). Both FA1 and FA3 show remarkably unimodal northwestwards paleocurrent directions.  The lower fluvial association (FA1) consists of trough cross-bedded medium- to coarse-grained sandstone with very consistently northwestwards paleocurrents. It was deposited as large, sheet-braided fluvial lobes, and grades upward into FA2 by intercalation as at Hawks Head, the Z Bend and Four Ways.  The tidal sandflat association (FA2) contains fine- to medium-grained, mostly thin-bedded sandstone, which was deposited in a very shallow-marine to coastal, largely tidal, environment when sediment influx to the basin lessened. Laterally extensive, comparatively thin sheets of FA1 are interbedded in the lower part of FA2, and gradually diminish in abundance upward. Adhesion surfaces and indicators of emergence are common, but eolian cross-bedding has not been recognised. The pattern of northwestwards- and upwards- increasing FA2 intercalations above FA1 is suggestive of a large-scale transgressive systems tract above a low stand tract (FA1). The Loop is cut into dominantly FA2, the Z Bend is mixed FA2 with a large FA1 sheet near the base, and the top of the section at Hawks Head is FA1, above thinner bedded and bioturbated FA2  The upper fluvial sandstone association (FA3) sharply overlies FA2 - the contact is well exposed 6.5 km northwest of the Loop West lookout and Skywalk, at MGA242850E 6954650N. FA3 consists of cross-bedded medium- to very coarse-grained and locally pebbly, poorly sorted sandstone. It commonly is arranged into repeated fining-upwards cycles, each 10 to 15 m thick and grading from thickly cross-bedded very coarse-grained sandstone upwards to finer grained, thinner bedded sandstone. These are very well exposed around Bracken Point (MGA 229900E 695400N). Towards the top of FA3, bedding scale decreases, with fining upward cycles only a few metres thick in, for example, the Red Bluff area. Like FA1, it was deposited in a sheet-braided fluvial environment by lobes that prograded to the northwest, although depositional energy levels were higher overall than for FA1. Scattered trails and burrows near its top indicate a coastal setting. Vertical burrows first appear near or at the base of the Gabba Gabba Member, a distinctive pebbly sandstone and pebble conglomerate marker present near the top of FA3 in the lower river valley and coastal cliffs.  Facies Association 4 (FA4) is a cyclic, interdistributary bay and coastal distributary sequence that formed adjacent to and above the braided fluvial deposits of FA3. Hocking (191) placed the base of FA4 as the first significant intercalation of red laminated siltstone, which forms a clear horizon along the coastal cliffs. Most of the association consists of fining-upwards cycles 1 to 2 m thick, from trough cross-bedded medium-grained sandstone to red, commonly bioturbated laminated and rippled siltstone. There is a subaqueous channel complex near the exposed top of the association, which is well exposed in the face of Red Bluff, and consists of medium to large scale trough cross-bedded, medium to coarse-grained moderately sorted sandstone.  Pipe rock , formed by abundant vertical  Skolithos  and similar burrows, characterize this facies.  The trace fossils (burrows, trackways and trails) are surprisingly different in the tidal sandflat (FA2) and coastal distributary (FA4) units. Vertical pipe-rock ( Skolithos  primarily, assigned to a  Skolithis-Diplocraterion  Ichnofauna by Trewin and McNamara, 1995, and  Skolithos  ichnofacies by MacNamara, 2014) characterises FA4, yet is rare in FA2, where a different suite of vertical burrow types ( Heimdallia  and similar, assigned to a  Heimdallia-Diplichnites  Ichnofauna by Trewin and McNamara, 1995, and  Scoyenia  ichnofacies by McNamara, 2014) is predominant. Large arthropod trackways, up to 35 cm across, are common on rippled surfaces on the tidal sandflat deposits, but rare in the less-rippled coastal distributary and interdistributary deposits of FA4. The overall setting of FA2 and FA4 clearly differed enough to provide different ecological niches. A similar succession of ichnofacies is present in the lower Beacon Supergroup in Antarctica (Bradshaw, 1981, 2013).  A fifth association (FA5) is present along the Murchison River course east of the Northampton Inlier, upstream from Pencell Pool. This consists of medium- to large-scale trough cross-bedded, very coarse-grained quartz sandstone with granule and pebble stringers similar to the coarser parts of FA1 and FA3. It had unimodal northwestwards paleocurrents, and rests sharply on rocks similar in lithofacies and trace fauna to FA4 that are exposed along Pencell Pool. The contact is at a rock bar across river at 283180E 692400N. This interval in turn rests on cross-bedded flauvial facies the same as FA3, further downstream and well exposed in the area of 283800E 6922900N. A small, stratigraphically lower, outcrop of fine- to medium-grained thin-bedded sandstone with a trace fossil fauna the same as FA2 is present in an isolated breakaway on Riverside station at 282900E 6921300N.  ","The Tumblagooda Sandstone was deposited in sheet-braided fluvial to fluvial-dominated coastal settings, including intertidal to supratidal sandflats, interdistributary bay with crevass splays, and wave-reworked fluvial-dominated delta-front environments. The most proximal outcrops, on the eastern side of Geraldton 1:250 000 sheet, may be grading towards an alluvial fan, versus sheet-braided fluvial, environment. They may be proximal correlatives of any of the facies associations seen further west. Paleocurrent directions were predominantly northwestwards (vector mean 300 degrees approximately) for fluvial deposits, and southwards for tidal deposits, indicating coastal processes were dominated by longshore rather than onshore currents. They show no deflection over or by the Northampton Inlier, indicating it was not a positive topographic feature during deposition.  FA1, FA3 and FA5 are predominantly sheet-braided fluvial deposits, with minor bioturbation (but no reworking) indicating marine influence in the upper parts of FA1 and FA3. FA1 grades up into the tidal sandflat deposits of FA2 by intercalation, and the uppermost part of FA3 shows sparse bioturbation beneath the more bioturbated coastal distributary and interdistributary deposits of FA4, in both cases reflecting gradual transgression (Hocking, 1991, 2000). FA5 is present only east of the Northampton Inlier, in a more proximal setting based on paleocurrent directions, and shows no marine influence.  Trewin and McNamara (1995) and McNamara (2014) proposed a fully continental setting for FA2, with deposition in lacustrine and eolian environments driven by water table rise and fall. This has not been accepted by other workers, who all follow the model proposed by Hocking (1991) who considered the degree and nature of bioturbation and the range of sedimentary structures to indicate tidal conditions with intermittent emergence and eolian influences (forming adhesion surfaces and wind warts) on deposition.  From a sequence stratigraphic perspective, most of the type section forms a single large-scale depositional sequence. The fluvial deposits of FA1 are readily interpreted as a low stand tract. The upwards increasing intercalations of FA2, with only minor sheets of FA1 in The Loop area, suggest a transgressive systems tract. The abrupt recommencement of fluvial deposition at the sharp FA2 to FA3 boundary is probably the result of progradation by overstepping, and the start of a high stand tract. The maximum flooding surface is downstream of The Loop, possibly at the FA2-FA3 boundary. The thinner fining-upwards cycles in the upper part of FA3 may mark the transition to a regressive systems tract, embodied by FA4. The sharp onset of fluvial deposition once again (FA5) is the start of the next low stand tract and depositional sequence.",,1300,,"No basal or upper relationships other than with Cretaceous rocks (or possibly, Permian rocks upstream of Pencell Pool) are seen in the type section or reference section, but a non-conformable relationship with the Mesoproterozoic Northampton Inlier can be inferred in some of the scattered exposures south and southeast of the Murchison River sections. ",,17,,,,4,,,,419.2,,393.3,,"The age of the Tumblagooda Sandstone has been poorly constrained, with ages ranging from Late Cambrian to Early Devonian suggested by various authors for various reasons. McNamara (2014) summarized prior discussions, based on interpreted paleosols (Retallack, 2009), the age of mineralisation in the Northmpton Inlier (Hocking, 1991; Byrne and Harris, 1993), paleomagnetism (Schmidt and Embleton, 1990; Schmidt and Hamilton, 1990), biostratigraphy of apparent correlatives and/or overlying units (Gorter et al., 1994; Mory et al., 1998 and later reports, Evans et al., 2007), and himself inferred a Silurian age from regional grounds.   Prior to 2016, only trace fossils and a single poorly preserved mould of an arthropod had been found in outcrop. The few microfossils recovered from subsurface intersections are now regarded as from a similar, but older, previously unrecognized unit. The age is now established as Early Devonian from sparse poorly preserved plant debris, but older than unequivocally Middle and Upper Devonian rocks exposed along the eastern basin margin (Allen et al., in prep.). Both the general lithofacies in the Tumblagooda Sandstone and the trace fossil fauna in FA2 are also very similar to those in the Taylor Group (lower Beacon Supergroup, Antarctica), where  Heimdallia   is also abundant (Bradshaw, 1981, 2013).",No,,,767,,No,Approved for DE,No,Yes,D,_tu,,,,,MIGSDRH,2.02E+13,,No,No

It conformably overlies the O'Donnell Formation and conformably underlies the Valentine Siltstone. The formation consists of a tripartite division; a prominent siltstone-dominated unit between two sandstone-dominated units. The sandstones are white or pale grey, variably quartz, lithic, and feldspar-rich, commonly cross-bedded and/or cross-laminated. The siltstone-dominated unit consists of dominantly green or grey laminated siltstone and shale, micaceous in places, with planar parallel or cross-laminations. Thin- or medium-bedded, quartz-rich sandstones may be found interbedded with the siltstones.","The Tunganary Formation is exposed in the Speewah Basin which is itself exposed along the northeast and northwest edges of the western zone of the Lamboo Province and abuts the Kimberley Basin. The formation outcrops on the CAMBRIDGE GULF, LISSADELL, DIXON RANGE, LANSDOWNE, MOUNT RAMSAY, LENNARD RIVER, CHARNLEY, and YAMPI 1:250 000 map sheets.","The Tunganary Formation was probably named after Tunganary Gorge, located approximately 45 km south-southeast of Bedford Downs Homestead (BEDFORD 1:100 000; LANSDOWNE 1:250 000).",,"The Tunganary Formation is dominated by white or pale grey, fine- to very coarse-grained, poorly- to moderately-sorted, feldspathic or lithic-quartz sandstones. Thin interbeds of quartz sandstone (quartz arenite), pebbly lithic sandstone, and siltstone are observed. The sandstones may be trough cross-bedded with thin, parallel, wavy, or ripple cross-laminations. Prominent ripple marks occur in the upper sandstone unit (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967). These laminations comprise black or dark grey siltstone (1-2 mm thick, approx. 5 cm apart). Fluid escape structures have been observed within the sandstones. The Tunganary Formation sandstones are slightly recrystallised producing a sugary texture with some silica-cemented sandstones (Gellatly et al., 1969). On MOUNT RAMSAY, DIXON RANGE, LENNARD RIVER, and LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 map sheets (i.e. the east Kimberley region) the sandstone-dominated lithofacies tend to be more feldspathic compared to outcrops on CHARNLEY 1:250 000 (i.e. the northwest of the Kimberley region; Bow and Gemuts, 1967; Gellatly and Derrick, 1967; Roberts et al., 1968; Gellatley et al., 1969; Griffin et al., 1993). Thorne et al. (1999) reported scour-and-fill structures and cross-laminations indicating a paleocurrent towards the north on LISSADELL 1:250 000.  The siltstone-dominated unit is commonly grey or green, planar and wavy parallel laminated. Thin, interbedded quartz sandstone and shale are seen. The siltstones (or locally, phyllites) may be highly chloritic and sericitic (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967; Griffin et al., 1993). The siltstone has moderate- to densely-packed synaereses cracks, but these may be local features. Cross-bedding and cross-laminations are common in interbedded sandstones. Rare green chert has been observed within the Tunganary Formation on DIXON RANGE 1:250 000 (Dow and Gemuts, 1967).","The quartz-rich sandstones with minor /small erosion events suggest a fluvial, possibly braided river, depositional system. The siltstone-dominated lithofacies in the middle of the unit could represent a period of decreased current energy, for example, as a result of channel avulsion and the formation of ephemeral ponds, or possibly represent overbank/floodplain deposits.",80,1008,,The Tunganary Formation is part of the continuous and conformable sedimentary formations within the Speewah Group. The formation is intruded by the Hart Dolerite at all stratigraphic intervals.,,17,,,,4,,,,1814,,1791,,"Detrital zircon data for the Tunganary Formation give a maximum depositional age of 1839 Â± 4 Ma (GSWA 206101, Kirkland et al., 2014). However, more recent detrital zircon dating of the Tunganary Formation indicated an age component at 1814 Â± 10 Ma from a population of seven young grains with the youngest detrital zircon dated at 1803 Â± 12 Ma (1&sigma;) (GS11031-2, Ramsay et al., 2017). The age of the youngest population at c. 1814 Ma is therefore considered a best estimate for the maximum age of the Tunganary Formation and Speewah Group.  The Hart Dolerite extensively intrudes the Speewah Group (including the Tunganary Formation) and lower Kimberley Group. Sills of Hart Dolerite and considered to be contiguous with basalt lava in the Carson Volcanics (Kimberley Group) and together constitute the Hart-Carson Large Igneous Province (Sheppard et al., 2012).

4068,18702,P_-TK-s,3629,Turee Creek Group,1,"Mudstone, siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate, dolomite; minor diamictite, limestone and iron formation; intruded by Balgara Dolerite sills","The Turee Creek Group has an estimated maximum thickness of about 4 km and is exposed on PANNAWONICA, MOUNT STUART, WYLOO, FARQUHAR, HARDEY, ROCKLEA, MOUNT LIONEL, PARABURDOO, SNOWY MOUNT, and NEWMAN. It disconformably overlies the Hamersley Group, contains at least two internal unconformities, and is in turn unconformably overlain by the Shingle Creek Group. The Turee Creek Group is predominantly a siliciclastic succession that in the Hardey Syncline has been subdivided (in ascending order) into the Kungarra, Koolbye and Kazput Formations. The Kungarra Formation contains two distinctive glaciogenic units, the Meteorite Bore (P_-TKkm-se) and Calgra (P_-TKkg-sd) Members that are useful marker horizons and considered to be of Huronian age (2.4 - 2.21 Ma). These units form an upward-coarsening and shallowing, predominantly marine to fluvial, succession that was deposited in a foreland basin (Turee Creek Basin) linked to the c. 2215-2145 Ma Ophthalmia Orogeny. The age of the Turee Creek Group is poorly constrained but was deposited sometime between c. 2445 and 2208 Ma.","The Turee Creek Group is mainly exposed in synclinal keels on PANNAWONICA, MOUNT STUART, WYLOO, FARQUHAR, HARDEY, ROCKLEA, MOUNT LIONEL, PARABURDOO, SNOWY MOUNT, and NEWMAN that were formed during the c. 2215-2145 Ma Ophthalmia Orogeny. The group has an estimated maximum thickness of about 4 km.","The type area for the Turee Creek Group is in the Hardey Syncline on HARDEY and ROCKLEA, although the name is most likely derived from Turee Creek on SNOWY MOUNT approximately 120 km to the southeast. The Turee Creek Group was originally defined by MacLeod et al. (1963) and Halligan and Daniels (1964) as a formation within the Wyloo Group, which was considered at the time to be the uppermost division of the Mount Bruce Supergroup. According to this definition, the Wyloo Group consisted (in ascending order) of the Turee Creek Formation, Beasley River Quartzite, Mount McGrath Formation (including the Cheela Springs Basalt Member), Duck Creek Dolomite, and Ashburton Formation. No type sections or localities were defined for these units, and no unconformities were recognised in the succession. Recognition of a regional unconformity at the base of the Beasley River Quartzite by Trendall (1979) resulted in a redefinition of the Mount Bruce Supergroup and elevation of the Turee Creek Formation to group status. Trendall (1979) also recognised a lower unit that is broadly equivalent to most units that were previously referred to as &ldquo;Turee Creek Formation&rdquo;, and named it the Kungarra Formation. No type section was defined for the Kungarra Formation, but the type area is between the Beasley River and Kungarra Gorge (from which the formation takes its name) on the northern limb of the Hardey Syncline on HARDEY and ROCKLEA. In addition, Trendall (1979) also defined the Meteorite Bore Member of the Kungarra Formation and recognised three informal upper units in the Hardey Syncline, which he called &ldquo;unnamed quartzite units 1-3&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;unnamed carbonate and shale unit&rdquo;. &ldquo;Unnamed quartzite unit 3&rdquo;was excluded from the Turee Creek Group, and the upper part, above an angular intraformational unconformity, was later demonstrated to be partly equivalent to the Beasley River Quartzite (Powell and Horwitz, 1994; Martin et al., 2000).   The stratigraphy of the upper part of the Turee Creek Group was formalised by Thorne and Tyler (1996). &ldquo;Unnamed quartzite unit 1&rdquo; was renamed the Koolbye Formation, after Koolbye Well (Zone 50, MGA 508254E 7456983N) on ROCKLEA, and a type section was proposed that begins at Zone 50, MGA 503500E 7466700N. The Kazput Formation was defined to include the &ldquo;unnamed carbonate and shale unit&rdquo; and &ldquo;unnamed quartzite unit 2 and 3&rdquo; in the type area, and is named after Kazput Pool (Zone 50, MGA 519270E 7458990N) on ROCKLEA. The type area for the Kazput formation is on HARDEY around Zone 50, MGA 50970E 7468000N, but no type section has been defined. No other formal lithostratigraphic units have been established outside of the Hardey Syncline, where equivalent units are generally undivided and assigned to the Turee Creek Group. ",,"The Turee Creek Group mainly consists of mudstone, siltstone and sandstone, with lesser conglomerate, dolomite (locally stromatolitic and oolitic), iron formation, diamictite and dolerite sills. In the Hardey Syncline, it is subdivided into four formations (in ascending order): the Kungarra Formation (P_-TKk-sf), Koolbye Formation (P_-TKo-stq), Kazput Formation (P_-TKa-xs-k), and Anthiby Formation (P_-TKn-sf).  The basal Kungarra Formation gradationally overlies the Boolgeeda Iron Formation (P_-HAo-ci) at the top of the Hamersley Group, and is composed predominantly of turbiditic siltstone and mudstone with minor thin-bedded sandstone. Close to the basal contact, pyritic green mudstones are interbedded with thin grey chert beds and local dolomitic mudstone. Mudstone and fine-grained siltstone are parallel-planar laminated, whereas coarse-grained siltstone and fine-grained sandstone are either parallel-planar laminated or ripple cross-laminated. Coarser grained sandstone beds are lenticular and either structureless or normally graded, with locally parallel-planar laminated or ripple cross-laminated tops. Higher up in the formation, close to the contact with the Meteorite Bore Member, it consists predominantly of fine- to coarse-grained sandstone interbedded with mudstone, siltstone and minor stromatolitic dolomite. Sandstones at this stratigraphic level are characterised by planar lamination, ripple cross-lamination, wave-ripple lamination, convolute lamination, hummocky cross-stratification, and large-scale cross-bedding. The upper third of the Kungarra Formation contains two distinctive units dominated by glacigenic diamictite interbedded with mudstone, siltstone and fine grained sandstone. The lowermost unit is known as the Meteorite Bore Member (P_-TKkm-se) and is 270 m thick in the type section on the northern limb of the Hardey Syncline. The uppermost unit is exposed about 500 m above the Meteorite Bore Member in the type area, where it is locally truncated by the unconformity at the base of the Beasley River Quartzite. This unit has been named the Calgra Member (P_-TKkg-sd). The two diamictite units are separated by an interval of fine- to coarse-grained sandstone, siltstone and mudstone, with well-preserved ripple- and planar-lamination, hummocky cross-stratification, and convolute lamination. Overall, the Kungarra Formation displays an upward-shallowing trend, with fine- to coarse-grained sandstone, dolomitic sandstone and dolomite becoming more predominant towards the upper contact with the Koolbye Formation. A detailed sedimentological analysis of the Kungarra Formation is provided by Van Kranendonk et al. (2015). The upper part of the Kungarra Formation is also intruded by a number of dolerite sills that have been dated at c. 2208 Ma (M&uuml;ller et al., 2005), and are erosionally truncated by an unconformity at the base of the Anthiby Formation (Martin and Morris, 2010).  The Koolbye Formation consists of fine- to coarse-grained quartz sandstone with minor siltstone, mudstone and conglomerate. The base of the formation is marked by thin, discontinuous pebbly sandstone and local pebble lags demarcating large scours and is overlain by upward-fining tabular to lenticular beds of fine- to medium-grained quartz sandstone with thin argillaceous interbeds. The sandstones contain small- to medium-scale trough cross-stratification, parallel-planar to undulatory lamination, and ripple cross-lamination. Fluvial paleocurrent directions were towards the north-northeast (Martin et al., 2000). A detailed facies analysis of the Koolbye Formation has been presented by Mazumder et al. (2015). The Kazput Formation consists of siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate, grey recrystallised dolomite (locally stromatolitic), and thin beds of calcareous iron formation. The formation can be informally divided into two units, the lowermost of which consists of dolomite and siltstone that is equivalent to Trendall s &ldquo;unnamed carbonate and shale unit&rdquo;. A detailed sedimentological and carbon isotope study of this lower unit has been presented by Martindale et al. (2015). This unit is overlain by an upward-coarsening arenaceous unit that is equivalent to &ldquo;unnamed quartzite unit 2&rdquo; and part of &ldquo;unnamed quartzite unit 3&rdquo; of Trendall (1979). Siltstones and fine-grained sandstones that overlie an angular unconformity in the vicinity of Zone 50, MGA 494400E 7467500N constitute the Anthiby Formation (P_-TKn-sf), and are in turn unconformably overlain by the Beasley River Quartzite.   Outside of the Hardey Syncline, the Turee Creek Group consists mainly of poorly exposed mudstone and siltstone, although significant thicknesses of interbedded siltstone and sandstone with minor carbonates, that are locally stromatolitic and oolitic, are preserved in the upper parts of the succession in the Duck Creek and Turee Creek Synclines. The metamorphic grade of the Turee Creek Group does not exceed prehnite-pumpellyite-epidote facies, although the regional metamorphic grade of the underlying Fortescue Group increases from north to south across the Pilbara Craton (Smith et al., 1982). This increasing metamorphic grade has been interpreted in terms of the northward migration of a low-grade metamorphic front associated with the migration of the c. 2215-2145 Ma Ophthalmia Orogeny (Rasmussen et al., 2005).","The Kungarra Formation is interpreted to be an upward shallowing, predominantly deep-marine succession deposited in a shelf environment (Seymour et al., 1988). Martin et al. (2000) concluded that it consisted of a number of upward-shallowing prodelta to off-shore marine cycles, which has recently been largely confirmed by Van Kranendonk et al. (2015) who also identified two glacio-eustatic cyles within the formation, characterized by falling stage systems tracts. The Meteorite Bore Member within the upper third of the Kungarra Formation contains abundant evidence of glacigenic deposition, and is interpreted to have been deposited by the melting of tidewater glaciers, although much of the unit in the type area has probably been reworked by sediment gravity flows (Trendall, 1976, 1981; Martin, 1999; Van Kranendonk and Mazumder, 2015). The uppermost Kungarra Formation, immediately below the contact with the Koolbye Formation, was deposited in a shallow marine to intertidal environment (Martin et al., 2000; Van Kranendonk et al., 2015). The Koolbye Formation is interpreted to have been deposited in marginal marine to fluvial environments during an overall relative sea-level fall and progradation throughout the lower Turee Creek Group (Martin et al., 2000; Mazumder et al., 2015). The base of the Kazput Formation is marked by a deepening to a subtidal marine environment below storm wave-base, followed by progradation and shallowing to a fluvial environment in the upper part of the formation (Martin et al., 2000; Martindale et al., 2015). Shallow to deep marine environments prevail in the Anthiby Formation (P_-TKn-sf), above an angular unconformity.  The tectonic setting of the Turee Creek Group is generally interpreted to be a retroarc foreland basin with an uplifted hinterland to the south (Krapez, 1996; Martin et al., 2000), whereas Van Kranendonk et al., (2015) have interpreted an intracontinental rift setting with uplift to the southeast.",,,,"The Turee Creek Group disconformably overlies the Boolgeeda Iron Formation at the top of the Hamersley Group, and is unconformably overlain by the Beasley River Quartzite at the base of the Shingle Creek Group. An angular unconformity within the group has been identified at the base of the Anthiby Formation in the vicinity of Zone 50, MGA 494400E 7467500N, and can be correlated into the core of the Hardey Syncline at Zone 50 MGA 507550E 7468320N (Martin et al., 2000) where it is commonly confused with the basal Shingle Creek Group unconformity (e.g. Powell and Horwitz, 1994; Thorne et al., 1995; Martindale et al., 2015; Mazumder et al., 2015; Van Kranendonk et al., 2015). The basal Shingle Creek Group unconformity is generally markedly less angular than the unconformity within the Kazput Formation and is well developed in the Hardey Syncline on HARDEY and ROCKLEA, the Duck Creek Syncline on MOUNT STUART, FARQUHAR, WYLOO and HARDEY, and the Turee Creek Syncline on SNOWY MOUNT, as well as around the Wyloo Dome on WYLOO and HARDEY. Field relationships around the eastern closure of the Wyloo Dome, in the vicinity of Zone 50, MGA 466000E 7483300N, suggest the presence of additional intraformational unconformities within the lower Turee Creek Group (Martin et al., 2000), but these have not been mapped in detail and their stratigraphic affinities are unknown.",,17,,,,2,,,,2445,,2208,,"The age of the Turee Creek Group is very poorly constrained, but it is interpreted to have been deposited between c. 2445 and 2208 Ma. The maximum age is constrained by the youngest felsic igneous rocks within the Woongarra Rhyolite near the top of the Hamersley Group, which have been dated at 2445Â±5 Ma (Trendall et al., 2004). The minimum age is constrained by sills of 2208Â±10 Ma Balgara Dolerite (M&uuml;ller et al., 2005) that intrude the upper part of the Kungarra Formation in the Hardey Syncline and are erosionally truncated by the intraformational unconformity at the base of the Anthiby Formation and by the basal Beasley River Quartzite unconformity (Martin et al., 2000; Martin and Morris, 2010). However, the age of the sills is indistinguishable from the 2209Â±15 Ma maximum depositional age of the Cheela Springs Basalt in the upper Shingle Creek Group, and the sills are interpreted to be cogenetic with the basalts (Martin and Morris, 2010).

It has an average primitive mantle-normalized (McDonough and Sun, 1995) thorium to titanium ratio higher than all other mafic and ultramafic units in the Agnew-Lawlers area. This, and a typically low niobium to thorium average ratio of 1.1 (0.9 to 1.4) indicates that the magma was crustally contaminated (e.g. Said et al., 2012). The chondrite-normalized REE profile shows enriched light REE and flat heavy REE trends.

The Subgroup comprises five formations which, in stratigraphic order from the base, include the Never Can Tell Basalt, the Agnew Komatiite, and the Burrell Well, Redeemer and White Hope Basalts. Contacts between these formations are marked by changes in geochemical characteristics. The ultramafic component, the Agnew Komatiite, is marked by a clear magnetic high on aeromagnetic images. The mafic units predominantly consist of fine-grained basalt with local pyroxene-spinifex texture, varioles and amygdales.  The Twin Sisters Subgroup is underlain by the mafic-ultramafic volcanic Songvang Formation and overlain by the Mount White Group that includes mafic and felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks. It is intruded by mafic sills assigned to the Bounty Igneous Complex and Turret Dolerite.   The Two Sisters Subgroup is considered to be a stratigraphic equivalent of the Hannans Subgroup of the Kalgoorlie Group, which is mapped in the Kalgoorlie area to the south.","The Two Sisters Subgroup is exposed on SIR SAMUEL, WILDARA and MUNJEROO in the Lawlers and Leinster Anticlines and the outer part of the Mount White Syncline, which is cored by the Mount White Group. It is most widely preserved in the eastern limb of the Lawlers Anticline. All the constituent formations of the subgroup are exposed in this limb and in the western limb of the Leinster Anticline. The Two Sisters Subgroup is locally preserved in thin, discontinuous, fault-bounded lenses in the Scotty Creek Formation to the west of the Lawlers Anticline and Mount White Syncline (Beardsmore, 2002).","The Two Sisters Subgroup is named after The Two Sisters (Zone 51, MGA 252446E 6869900N), a northerly trending hill about 21 km to the south-southwest of the historical townsite of Lawlers.",,"The Two Sisters Subgroup is mainly composed of basalt and komatiite with minor intercalations of interflow sedimentary rocks. The Subgroup comprises five formations which, in stratigraphic order from the base, are the Never Can Tell Basalt, the Agnew Komatiite, and the Burrell Well, Redeemer and White Hope Basalts. Contacts between these formations are marked by changes in geochemical characteristics. The ultramafic component, the Agnew Komatiite, is marked by a clear magnetic high on aeromagnetic images. The mafic units predominantly consist of fine-grained basalt with local pyroxene-spinifex texture, varioles and amygdales. Basalt locally preserves pillows, varioles, amygdales and pyroxene-spinifex texture. Primary pyroxene crystals and needles in basaltic units of this subgroup have mainly been replaced by fine-grained actinolite, whereas plagioclase has largely been altered to clinozoisite and epidote (Beardsmore, 2002). Well-developed cumulate and platy olivine-spinifex textures are locally preserved in the komatiite. The Two Sisters Subgroup is metamorphosed in the upper greenschist - lower amphibolite facies (Liu et al., 2002; Duuring et al., 2012).  The main geochemical parameters used in the current stratigraphic subdivision for the Agnew-Lawlers area include primitive mantle-normalized thorium-to-titanium ratio and chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) pattern. The dataset used in this study has been partly acquired from GSWA s publicly accessible geochemical database ( http://www.geochem.dmp.wa.gov.au/geochem/ www.geochem.dmp.wa.gov.au/geochem/ ). Additional, external data were acquired through ARC Linkage Project LP110200747 (Hayman et al., 2015).  The Two Sisters Subgroup shows an overall decrease in SiO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2  and total FeO contents with increasing magnesium number, consistent with a tholeiitic trend. However, Al 2 O 2  content in samples from the Never Can Tell Basalt and in high-Fe tholeiitic samples from the Bounty Igneous Complex positively correlates with the magnesium number. The Never Can Tell Basalt is predominantly high-Fe tholeiitic in composition (Jensen, 1976), whereas the Bounty Igneous Complex is the most diverse in terms of major element chemistry of all mafic-ultramafic units in the Two Sisters Subgroup. The other mafic units are dominantly high-Mg tholeiitic basalt (Jensen, 1976).  Samples from the Two Sisters Subgroup, including those from intrusive rocks within it, define three distinct trends on a TiO 2  (wt%) vs Th (ppm) diagram (e.g. Barnes et al., 2012), and accordingly plot in three clusters on a TiO 2  (wt%) vs (Th/Ti)n (primitive mantle-normalized after McDonough and Sun, 1995) diagram.  Rocks from the Turret Dolerite that intruded the uppermost two units of the Two Sisters Subgroup plot within the high (Th/Ti) n  range (i.e. more than 8) and are also characterized by enriched light REE pattern with very low Nb/Th values (1.1 in average). They are geochemically similar to the Paringa Basalt as described by Barnes et al. (2012) from the Kambalda region.   The rest of the extrusive and intrusive mafic/ultramafic units in the Agnew-Leinster region plot in the low (Th/Ti) n  range (i.e. less than 3.8). These units have a relatively higher Nb/Th ratio, with an average of 5.8. Among them, the Agnew Komatiite and the Burrell Well Basalt are characterized by an average Nb/Th value of &ge;8. Such a high niobium-to-thorium ratio has been attributed to a lack of crustal contamination (Said et al., 2012). The chondrite-normalized REE pattern from these units is dominantly flat. The Burrell Well Basalt typically displays a slightly depleted light-REE pattern. Some components (informal members) within the units show a minor enrichment in light REEs.",,,,,"The Two Sisters Subgroup is underlain by the Songvang Formation. However, this lower contact is obscurred by mafic sills mainly belonging to the Bounty Igneous Complex  that, in part, overlaps in age with the Two Sisters Subgroup. Stratigraphically, the Mount White Group overlies the Two Sisters Subgroup, but the former is only preserved in the Mount White Syncline. In the northern part of the eastern limb of the syncline, the Agnew Komatiite and the Burrell Well Basalt of the Two Sisters Subgroup are in contact with the Vivien Formation (A-MWv-xmfv-s) of the Mount White Group along the Halfway Fault. The Turret Dolerite (A-_tt-xod-ax) lies between the Two Sisters Subgroup and the Mount White Group in the middle part of the syncline. To the west of the Lawlers Anticline, the Two Sisters Subgroup is overlain by the much younger Scotty Creek Formation (A-_sc-xta-sc) along a sheared, unconformable contact (Duuring et al., 2012). ",,17,,,Mixed,3,,,,2711,,2687,,"The maximum age of the Two Sisters Subgroup is constrained by the maximum depositional age of 2711 Â± 4 Ma of a metamorphosed siltstone that forms an interflow sedimentary rock within the Never Can Tell Basalt (Hayman et al., 2015).   The minimum age for the Two Sisters Subgroup is indicated by a combination of age determinations. A granophyre within an unnamed mafic sill intruding the upper part of the Subgroup, which is interpreted as co-magmatic with the Redeemer Basalt, has a TIMS (Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry) age of 2686.8 Â± 3.0 Ma. The Turret Dolerite, which intrudes the Redeemer and White Hope Basalts but is overlain by the Vivien Formation at the base of the overlying Mount White Group, has a TIMS age of 2690.7 Â± 1.2 Ma. Field and geochemical evidence indicate that the Redeemer Basalt, which underlies the White Hope Basalt and the Vivien Formation, is older than the Turret Dolerite. If the interpretation of the Redeemer Basalt as co-magmatic with the dated mafic sill is correct, the Redeemer Basalt must be at the older end of the error range (Hayman et al., 2015). The maximum depositional age of a volcanogenic metasandstone attributed to the Vivien Formation is 2692 Â± 3 Ma (Barley et al., 2003; Kositcin et al., 2008), which is similar to the c. 2692 Â± 4 Ma Kapai Slate from the Kambalda region (Claou&eacute;-Long et al., 1988; Squire et al., 2010), but its position in the stratigraphy is unclear. Squire et al. (2010) determined a maximum deposition age of 2686 Â± 7 Ma for the Vivien Formation, which is considered to be equivalent to volcaniclastic rocks of the Black Flag Group in the Kalgoorlie area.

1303,18795,P_-MEl-sl,1300,Ullawarra Formation,1,"Siltstone; subordinate fine-grained sandstone, dolostone, chert, and felsic volcaniclastic rock; intruded by numerous dolerite sills"," The Ullawarra Formation (P_-MEl-sl) has been recorded from most of the exposed Edmund Basin and is often intruded by numerous dolerite and gabbro sills. The formation ranges in thickness from 30 m on the Pingandy Shelf to about 1800 m in the central southern parts of the basin. The Ullawarra Formation conformably overlies the Devil Creek Formation, and its upper unit, the Curran Member (P_-MElc-sf), is transitional with the overlying Coodardoo Formation. In areas where the Coodardoo Formation has been removed by pre-Collier Group erosion, the Ullawarra Formation is unconformably overlain by the Backdoor Formation (Collier Group). The Ullawarra Formation is composed of siltstone, together with subordinate fine-grained sandstone, dolostone, and chert. More significant occurences of sandstone are found interbedded with siltstone in areas south of the Talga and Mount Vernon Faults and have been mapped as separate members (P_-MEl-sf, P_-MElc-sf, P_-MEl-ss, P_-MEln-ss). Other member units are less geographically widespread and include ferruginous and manganiferous siltstone (P_-MEl-sli), dolostone (P_-MEl-kd), and felsic volcaniclastic rock (P_-MEl-fn). The Ullawarra Formation was sourced from a region that lay to the southeast of the present outcrop area and deposited in a deep-marine shelf environment at c. 1463 Ma.  "," The Ullawarra Formation forms extensive outcrops throughout the Edmund Basin and has been recorded from the EDMUND, TUREE CREEK, MOUNT PHILLIPS, MOUNT EGERTON, COLLIER, ROBINSON RANGE, and PEAK HILL 1:250 000 map sheets. The formation is intruded by numerous dolerite and gabbro sills south of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system.  The Ullawarra Formation is thinnest on the Pingandy Shelf, north of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system. Here the sedimentary succession is dominated by siltstone (P_-MEl-sl) and ranges in thickness from 30 m on TEANO to 100 m on ELLIOTT CREEK and MOUNT VERNON. South of the Pingandy Shelf, on the northern and southern limbs of the Wanna Syncline, on ELLIOTT CREEK and EDMUND, the formation thickens to about 650 m and includes up to 250 m of sandstone and siltstone (P_-MElc-sf). About 650 m of Ullawarra Formation occurs in an incomplete section in the Geegin Syncline on MOUNT AUGUSTUS.   The maximum thickness, and highest proportion of sandstone within the Ullawarra Formation, is attained in the MOUNT EGERTON and ROBINSON RANGE 1:250 000 map sheet areas. On PEEDAWARRA, about 1350-1800 m of mixed siltstone and sandstone (P_-MEl-ss, P_-MEl-sf) are present on the southern limb of the Wanna Syncline and in the Berala Syncline respectively. A similar thickness is also recorded north of the Mount Clere Fault on ERRABIDDY and MARQUIS where mixed sandstone and siltstone (P_-MEln-ss) make up most of the stratigraphy. Further east, the Ullawarra Formation contains less sandstone overall. It is about 1500 m thick in the Mount Arapiles Anticline on MILGUN and 850-1100 m in the Range Creek East and Calyie Synclines on CALYIE, and south of the Lofty Range Fault on TANGADEE. The formation is about 1250 m thick on JAMINDI, and is largely composed of ferruginous and manganiferous siltstone (P_-MEl-sli). Two thin units of felsic volcaniclastic rock (P_-MEl-fn) occur within the upper part of the Ullawarra Formation on the northern limb of the Mount Arapiles Anticline on MILGUN and on the northern limb of the Calyie Syncline on CALYIE. "," The Ullawarra Formation was named by Daniels (1966) as a result of his revision of the former Top Camp Dolomite (Halligan and Daniels, 1964). Under Daniels' (1966) scheme, the Ullawarra Formation was recognized as a shale-dominated unit between the carbonate rocks of the underlying Devil Creek Formation and the sandstones of the overlying Curran Formation. This definition was later used by Chuck (1984) and Muhling and Brakel (1985). Martin et al. (1999) subsequently revised the definition of Daniels (1966) to downgrade the Curran Formation to member status and include it within the Ullawarra Formation. This modified definition was later followed by Martin and Thorne (2002) and Martin et al. (2005).  The name 'Ullawarra Formation' was derived from Ullawarra Homestead (Zone 50, MGA 409200E 7402900N), on northern ULLAWARRA. No type area or type section have been defined by previous authors, due largely to the poor outcrop and the disruptive effect of the numerous dolerite sills that intrude the succession on the EDMUND 1:250 000 map sheet. Martin and Thorne (2002) presented a representative section of the formation, taken from an area on northwestern ELLIOTT CREEK (Zone 50, MGA 47700E 7389400N), where it has not been intruded by mafic sills. ",," The principal lithologies in the Ullawarra Formation (P_-MEl-sl) are siltstone, together with lesser amounts of fine-grained sandstone, dolostone, and chert. Significant thicknesses of fine- to coarse-grained sandstone are interbedded with the siltstone in areas south of the Talga and Mount Vernon Faults and have been mapped as separate members of the Ullawarra Formation (P_-MEl-sf, P_-MElc-sf, P_-MEl-ss, P_-MEln-ss). A thick unit of ferruginous and manganiferous siltstone (P_-MEl-sli) has been mapped on JAMINDI and a localized occurrence of dolostone (P_-MEl-kd) has been recognized on KENNETH RANGE. Two small outcrops of felsic volcaniclastic rock (P_-MEl-fn) have also been mapped within the Ullawarra Formation on MILGUN and CALYIE. Pelitic and psammitic schist in the core of the Big Bend Syncline, north of James Creek on PINK HILLS, is interpreted as a metamorphosed equivalent of the Ullawarra Formation.   Non-silicified, siltstone-dominated parts of the Ullawarra Formation form poorly exposed, recessive outcrops, whereas silicified siltstone and sandstone forms low hills and strike ridges. A characteristic feature of the Ullawarra Formation is the large volume of dolerite sills (P_-_nr-od, P_-WKku-od) intruded into the succession south of the Talga - Mount Vernon Fault system.   Siltstone and very fine-grained sandstone are predominantly thinly bedded and parallel-planar to undulatory laminated, and are commonly ferruginous to locally calcareous (Martin et al., 2005). A fissile parting parallel to bedding is characteristic of Ullawarra Formation siltstones, except adjacent to dolerite sills where flaggy parting is generally present. Massive siltstone beds locally contain thin layers of mudstone rip-ups and euhedral moulds after evaporite and pyrite (Martin et al., 2005). Small-scale slump folds are also locally well-preserved and consist of layer-parallel isoclinal folds around which differential compaction has developed. Large (up to 20 cm) diagenetic barite nodules are present on KENNETH RANGE and TANGADEE. Compaction of these dense nodules into the underlying siltstone has resulted in a marked deformation of the host-rock laminae (Martin et al., 2007). The internal structure of the nodules consists of a medium-grained, equigranular core surrounded by coarse, radiating, elongate crystals around the margin. Adjacent small concretions locally coalesce into larger concretions and there is a strong internal fabric parallel to bedding, indicative of growth in situ. In thin section the barite crystals are surrounded by a matrix of siltstone. These barite nodules are closely associated with ironstone nodules, up to 5 cm diameter, that appear to be pseudomorphs after pyrite or marcasite (Martin et al., 2007).  Martin et al. (2005) describe the siltstones as consisting of recrystallized quartz silt to very fine-grained sand in a matrix of sericite, chlorite, granular epidote, and opaques. Minor recrystallization has produced a granular mosaic of anhedral to subhedral quartz crystals 0.05 - 0.25 mm across enclosing smaller dusty crystals of quartz and possible feldspar 0.02 - 0.08 mm across. Some siltstones contain up to 20% feldspar (mostly plagioclase and minor K-feldspar). The lamination is commonly cross-cut by subhedral, bladed or tabular to equant, anhedral moulds (mostly 0.25 - 5 mm long) filled with microquartz and clay minerals, or with iron oxides and microquartz. These moulds represent former dolomite or evaporite minerals (Martin et al., 2005). Anhedral opaque-mineral grains less than 0.1 mm are scattered throughout. Micro-enterolithic lamination comprising irregular cryptocrystalline and microcrystalline quartz-rich laminae is also locally present. In silicified siltstones, discontinuous irregular layers of microcrystalline anhedral quartz alternate with darker layers of cryptocrystalline opaque minerals. These opaques are present as either scattered grains or aggregates, and could be either kerogen or iron sulfide. Epidote is primarily a secondary replacement mineral and probably related to contact metamorphism adjacent to dolerite sills. Close to these sills, the siltstones are characterized by fine-grained microquartz with disseminated irregular clots of carbonate, acicular talc, subhedral bladed to tabular andalusite, and opaques (Martin et al., 2005).  Tabular to lenticular, fine- to medium-grained sandstone beds that occur interlayered with parallel-planar laminated siltstone are generally less than 0.5 m thick and mostly in the range 10-20 cm (Martin et al., 2005). Sandstone content ranges between 15 and 30% and, along with bed thickness, generally increases up-section. The internal structure is dominated by parallel-planar lamination, which locally passes upward into climbing ripple cross-lamination and undulatory lamination, forming Bouma Tb-c units. Sole marks, consisting mainly of bounce, brush, prod, and flute marks are commonly well preserved at the base of these beds, and give paleocurrent directions towards the west and northwest, consistent with paleocurrent directions determined from ripple cross-lamination. These paleocurrent directions are also consistent with the earlier observations of Daniels (1966). Sedimentary structures are also locally modified by soft sedimentary deformation (Martin et al., 2005).  Dolomitic units consist mainly of dolomitic siltstone and, less commonly, thin- to medium-bedded dololutite. Dolomitic siltstone is parallel-planar to undulatory laminated. Dololutite is generally massive or irregularly undulatory laminated.  "," The very fine-grained nature of most of the rock types, coupled with their range of sedimentary structures, general lack of shallow-water facies or evidence of wave-reworking suggests that the Ullawarra Formation was deposited in a deep marine-shelf environment. Sandstones were probably deposited from distal, relatively dilute turbiditiy currents, whereas siltstones were laid down during the final stages of turbidity current deposition and also from suspension settling in the intervening quiet-water periods. Paleocurrent data indicate that deposition took place in response to uplift in the area to the southeast of the exposed Edmund Basin and thickness data suggest the depocentre was located in the MOUNT EGERTON and ROBINSON RANGE 1:250 000 map sheet areas. ",,1800,," The Ullawarra Formation conformably overlies the Devil Creek Formation (P_-MEv-kd), whereas its upper unit, the Curran Member (P_-MElc-sf), is transitional with the overlying Coodardoo Formation (P_-MEc-st). In central and eastern parts of the Edmund Basin, where the Coodardoo Formation has been removed by pre-Collier Group erosion, the Ullawarra Formation is unconformably overlain by the Backdoor Formation (lower Collier Group).  The basal contact of the Ullawarra Formation is generally poorly exposed and taken as the top of the youngest major dolostone bed in the Devil Creek Formation, or where the proportion of dolostone falls below 10% in thinly bedded sections (Muhling and Brakel, 1985). The contact between the lower part of the Ullawarra Formation and the Curran Member is marked by a gradational increase in the proportion of interbedded sandstone and cannot be placed with certainty. Dolerite sills locally intrude both the upper and lower contacts, further obscuring contact relationships with adjacent units (Martin et al., 2005). ",,17,,,,4,,,,1590,,1455,,"The Ullawarra Formation was probably deposited in the interval 1590-1455 Ma, based on regional stratigraphic relationships and age data from its member units (P_-MEl-fn, P_-MEl-sf).   The maximum age of the Ullawarra Formation is constrained by its stratigraphic position within the Edmund Group, but must be significantly younger than mineralization in the Gooragoora and Irregully Formations at the Abra polymetallic deposit on CALYIE. Here, mineralization is dated to between c. 1610 and 1590 Ma (Zi et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2015).   Wingate et al. (GSWA 149031, 2010) and Wingate et al. (GSWA 143440, 2012) obtained maximum depositional ages (1&sigma;) of 1356 Â± 38 Ma and 1415 Â± 27 Ma from felsic volcaniclastic units within the Ullawarra Formation on MILGUN and CALYIE respectively. However, a more conservative estimate of the maximum depositional age is provided by the youngest zircon population in each sample which is 1463 Â± 8 Ma and 1455 Â± 9 Ma respectively. In addition, Wingate et al. (GSWA 148994, 2010) acquired a maximum despositional age of 1461 Â± 7 Ma from the youngest group of detrital zircons in a sandstone sample, taken from the Ullawarra Formation on PEEDAWARRA. The youngest zircons in this group are c. 1403 Ma. The most reliable ages obtained from the Ullawarra Formation are within uncertainty of the c. 1465 Ma mean age of the Narimbunna Dolerite (Wingate, 2002; Martin et al., 2005) that intrudes the Edmund Group and indicates that dolerite intrusion, felsic volcanism, and Ullawarra Formation sedimentation were essentially coeval (GSWA 149031, Wingate et al., 2010).

It conformably overlies the Tunganary Formation and underlies the Lansdowne Arkose. The formation is dominantly a fine-grained succession of laminated siltstone and shale with interbedded thin-bedded sandstones.  A black rhyolite tuff is used to denote the base of the Valentine Siltstone (Thorne et al., 1999). This felsic unit has yielded a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 1835 Â± 3 Ma (Page and Sun, 1994; Sheppard et al., 2012). This age has been used as a depositional age for the Speewah Group. Thin-bedded dacitic and rhyolitic tuffs and tuffaceous siltstones are interbedded throughout the formation.","The Valentine Siltstone is poorly exposed compared to the adjacent sandstone-dominated formations. Like the rest of the Speewah Group the Valentine Siltstone outcrops in a thin northeast- and northwest-trending corridor along the margins of the Kimberley Basin adjacent to the western zone of the Lamboo Province. It outcrops on the following 1:250 000 map sheets: CAMBRIDGE GULF, LISSADELL, DIXON RANGE, LANSDOWNE, MOUNT RAMSAY, LENNARD RIVER, CHARNLEY, and YAMPI.","The derivation of the name of the Valentine Siltstone is questionable. There are numerous geographical features in the east Kimberley region where the Speewah Group is exposed which bear the name Valentine. For example, Valentine Creek (Lat. -15&ordm; 43' 10'' S, Long. 128&ordm; 40' 20'' E) and Valentine Rock Hole (Lat. -15&ordm; 43' 3'' S, Long. 128&ordm; 38' 53'' E) on the CAMBRIDGE GULF 1:250 000 map sheet or the Valentine Spring (Lat. -16&ordm; 13' 33'' S, Long. 128&ordm; 20' 59'' E) on the LISSADELL 1:250 000 map sheet. The formation was first described from the first edition DIXON RANGE 1:250 000 explanatory notes, Sheet SE/52-6 (Dow and Gemuts, 1967).",,"The Valentine Siltstone is poorly exposed throughout the Kimberley region so descriptions of its lithological make-up are limited. The formation commonly consists of either red, ochreous rock overlain by a pink or purple siltstone (Gellatly et al., 1969) or green and purple shale and siltstone with interbedded quartz or feldspathic sandstone (Dow and Gemuts, 1967; Gellatly and Derrick, 1967; Roberts et al., 1968; Gellatly et al., 1974; Griffin et al., 1993). The siltstone is chloritic in places (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967). Thicker bedded sandstones may be cross-bedded (Thorne et al., 1999). The Valentine Siltstone contains thin interbedded volcaniclastic material such as dacitic to rhyolitic tuff and tuffaceous siltstone (Sheppard et al., 1999; Thorne et al., 1999), thin discontinuous rhyolitic ashstone and tuff (Dow and Gemuts, 1967), rhyolitic tuff (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967), and &quot;volcanic material&quot; (Gellatly et al., 1969). On the LISSADELL 1:250 000 sheet is a black, crystal-poor rhyolitic tuff which marks the base of the Valentine Siltstone and provides a depositional age of 1835 Â± 3 Ma for the formation (Page and Sun, 1994; Thorne et al., 1999; Sheppard et al., 2012). On the LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 sheet there is an increase in the abundance of feldspathic sandstone within the Valentine Siltstone 5 m from the base of the formation, whereupon it grades into the highly feldspathic overlying Lansdowne Arkose (Griffin et al., 1993).","The dominance of fine-grained, laminated sediment suggests a quiescent depositional environment, possibly lacustrine (playa) or shallow marine. Active volcanism is indicated by the tuffaceous deposits but the volcanic centre is unknown at present. Cross-bedded sanstones suggest episodic high current energy intervals.",4.5,49,,"The Valentine Siltstone is part of a continuous sedimentary succession with conformable contacts at its top and base. On the LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 sheet the Valentine Siltstone grades into the overlying Lansdowne Arkose. The formation is extensively intruded by the Hart Dolerite, probably due to its less competent lithofacies compared with the surrounding sandstone-dominated formations.",,17,,,,4,,,,1814,,1791,,"A U-Pb zircon age of 1835 Â± 3 Ma was obtained from a rhyolitic tuff within the Valentine Siltstone (Page and Sun, 1994; Sheppard et al., 2012). However, detrital zircon geochronology from the Tunganary Formation, which conformably underlies the Valentine Siltstone, yielded an age component at 1814 Â± 10 Ma from a population of seven young grains with the youngest detrital zircon dated at 1803 Â± 12 Ma (1&sigma;) (GS11031-2, Ramsay et al., 2017). Consequently, Ramsay et al. (2017) interpreted the volcaniclastic rocks in the Valentine Siltstone as xenocrystic. The age of the Valentine Siltstone and Speewah Group is interpreted to be as old as c. 1814 Ma.  The Hart Dolerite extensively intrudes the Speewah Group (including the Valentine Siltstone) and lower Kimberley Group. Sills of Hart Dolerite and considered to be contiguous with basalt lava in the Carson Volcanics (Kimberley Group) and together constitute the Hart-Carson Large Igneous Province (Sheppard et al., 2012). Sheppard et al. (2012) reported U-Pb ages from a granophyric unit within the Hart Dolerite at 1799 Â± 17 Ma from zircon (GA 8759.8003) and 1795 Â± 15 Ma from baddeleyite (GSWA 113574). A minimum age of 1791 Â± 8 Ma was provided from sample GSWA 206156 by Wingate et al. (in prep).

The mafic rocks have slightly negatively sloping chondrite-normalized REE profiles marked by weak positive Eu anomalies and minor negative Sm anomalies. The degree of REE fractionation is very weak. The dolerite has high  143 Nd/ 144 Nd values ranging from 0.512376 to 0.512440, with uniformly positive &epsilon;Nd (T)  values from 0.27 to 1.75, leading to a narrow range of depleted mantle model ages (T2DM) between 1.89 and 1.99 Ga.","The Waldburg Dolerite has limited exposure within the Western Capricorn Orogen. It forms a series of predominantly northwesterly trending and locally northeasterly trending sills that intrude Depositional packages 1, 2 and 3 of the Edmund Group on MANGAROON, MOUNT AUGUSTUS and CANDOLLE. The sills were emplaced in a structural corridor between two major fault structures, the Lyons River Fault and the Ti Tree Shear Zone. The former has been interpreted as the principal suture zone between the Glenburgh Terrane of the Gascoyne Province and the Bandee Seismic Province of the Pilbara Craton (Johnson et al., 2011).  Throughout the Western Capricorn Orogen, the dolerite mostly forms laterally continuous sills (up to 36 km in length) that range from 100 to 500 m in thickness. On MANGAROON a medium- to coarse-grained dolerite sill is exposed about 14 km northeast of the Mangaroon Syncline (e.g. OXBEDM000210, Zone 50, MGA 365554E 7396984N). The sill is up to 300 m thick and is laterally continuous for up to 26 km.   On MOUNT AUGUSTUS two laterally continuous sills up to 500 m thick intrude siltstone of the Kiangi Creek Formation at, or near, the fault contact with the Irregully Formation. One sill is exposed 9 km northwest of the western closure of the Isabella Syncline and 5 km northeast of the Edmund Fault (e.g. OXBPEA000455, Zone 50, MGA 484821E 7296261N) and the other sill outcrops close to the Cobra Synclinorium (e.g. OXBBAN000196, Zone 50, MGA 461439E 7317250N).  On CANDOLLE a single, laterally continuous (18 km in length), 100-160 m thick dolerite sill outcrops between the Gaffney and Tringadee Faults, about 4 km northwest of the closure of the Resolution West Syncline (e.g. HNCCAN000410, Zone 50, MGA 535280E 7261618N).   ","The Waldburg Dolerite is named after Waldburg Homestead on CANDOLLE (Zone 50, MGA 536373E 7263576N). The Homestead is located about 2 km northeast of the site where the dolerite was first dated, providing an age of 1505 Â± 3 Ma(GSWA 143455, Wingate et al., 2012).",,"The Waldburg Dolerite generally outcrops as brownish-black rounded boulders, with thick colluvial scree at the top of low hills and ridges, within small creeks, or at the foot of low slopes. The unit is commonly altered, strongly fractured, and shows distinct spheroidal weathering.  On MANGAROON, CANDOLLE, and MOUNT AUGUSTUS, the Waldburg Dolerite consists mainly of medium- to coarse-grained dolerite with patchy areas of very coarse-grained dolerite to leucograbbro. It is also locally chaotically veined by fine- to medium-grained felsic, predominantly quartzfeldspar veinlets up to 34 cm thick that are interpreted to be late-stage felsic fractionates of the mafic magma. These silica-rich and immobile element-rich veinlets were sampled for zircon dating.  Clinopyroxene and plagioclase are the major mineral phases, with lesser orthopyroxene, and intergranular granophyre and/or myrmekite that are typically enriched in fine, acicular apatite and zircon. Irontitanium oxide minerals typically form skeletal crystals, and are extensively replaced by titanite. Both clinopyroxene and plagioclase are commonly twinned. The modal proportions of primary mineral phases vary slightly between outcrops. On MANGAROON, plagioclase (mainly andesine to labradorite) is the dominant mineral phase (~4045%) with 2025% quartzmicrocline granophyre, and 1012% clinopyroxene (diopside). On CANDOLLE the dolerite is dominated by both clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene, whereas on MOUNT AUGUSTUS there are roughly equal proportions of plagioclase and pyroxene.  Irrespective of outcrop, most of the primary minerals in the dolerite are distinctly to extremely altered. Up to 3040% of plagioclase is extensively replaced by epidote and/or polyphase pseudomorphs composed of saussurite-clinozoisite, and/or saussuritesericitealbite. Pale-green clinopyroxene is partly replaced by a secondary mineral assemblage comprising amphibole, chlorite, and saussurite, or acicular to bladed, up to 10 mm long actinolitetremolite pseudomorphs which are commonly orientated parallel to the main axis of the original minerals. Coarse-grained orthopyroxene phenocrysts are typically pseudomorphed by microcrystalline aggregates of tremolite, actinolite, and chlorite. Brown hornblende, pleonaste, and small flakes of secondary biotite are commonly interstitial to plagioclase and pyroxene.   The Waldburg Dolerite has a distinctive geochemical composition, which is significantly different to that of other mafic magmatic rocks within the western Capricorn Orogen. Mafic rocks of the Waldburg Dolerite typically have low concentrations of SiO 2  (47.9349.69%, average = 48.85%), K 2 O (0.280.47%, average = 0.39%), P 2 O 5  (0.080.14%, average = 0.13%), moderate concentrations of Na 2 O (1.752.48%, average = 2.16%), relatively high CaO (10.1811.62%. average = 10.89%) and MgO (6.239.85%, average = 7.06%), relatively moderate Mg# values (46.4961.12, average = 51.06), relatively high concentrations of Cr (134348 ppm, average = 228 ppm), and low Cu (7199 ppm, average = 90 ppm).   The mafic rocks have notably low concentrations of most REE and HFSE including: La (4.878.30 ppm, average = 7.21 ppm), Ce (11.4419.10 ppm, average = 17.06 ppm), Nd (8.0213.80 ppm, average = 11.86 ppm), Sm (2.424.03 ppm, average = 3.37 ppm), Gd (2.944.73 ppm, average = 3.96 ppm), Yb (1.512.51 ppm, average 2.05 ppm), Y (17.6025.9 ppm, average = 22.06 ppm), Zr (5593 ppm, average = 79 ppm), Nb (3.706.40 ppm, average = 5.30 ppm), Hf (1.462.70 ppm, average = 2.30 ppm), Th (0.600.94 ppm, average = 0.78 ppm). The Waldburg Dolerite has slightly negatively sloping chondrite-normalized REE profiles marked by weak positive Eu anomalies and minor negative Sm anomalies. The degree of REE fractionations is very weak in both light REE (La/Sm) N  = (1.281.54), and heavy REE (Gd/Yb) N  = (1.421.94). The rocks have low trace-element ratios: Th/La (0.100.13, average = 0.11), La/Nb (1.241.46, average = 1.36), Th/Nb (0.130.17, average = 0.15), and lowmoderate La/Sm (1.992.39, average = 2.14).   The Waldburg Dolerite has high  143 Nd/ 144 Nd values ranging from 0.512376 to 0.512440, with uniformly positive &epsilon;Nd (T)  values from 0.27 to 1.75, leading to a narrow range of depleted mantle model ages (T2DM) between 1.89 and 1.99 Ga.  ",,100,500,,"The Waldburg Dolerite has intruded sedimentary rocks from Depositional packages 1, 2 and 3 of the Edmund Group, typically at, or near, the fault contacts between silicified siltstones, and successions dominated by carbonate sedimentary rocks. On MANGAROON a dolerite sill was emplaced into steeply dipping, thin- to medium-bedded, trough cross-stratified, coarse-grained sandstone and siltstones of the Yilgatherra Formation (P_-MEy-st) at, or near, the contact with biotite monzogranite of the 1680-1620 Ma Durlacher Supersuite (P_-DU-g). On MOUNT AUGUSTUS the dolerite intruded into silicified, planar-laminated, steeply dipping siltstone to fine-grained, locally massive, strongly cleaved quartzitic sandstone of the Kiangi Creek Formation (P_-MEk-sl) at, or near, a fault contact with dolostone of the Irregally Formation (P_-MEi-kd). On CANDOLLE the dolerite was emplaced into mainly dolomitic siltstone with coarse-grained quartz sandstone interbeds and carbonate sedimentary rocks (mainly dololutite) of the Irregully Formation (P_-MEi-sl/P_-MEi-kd).",,17,,,,4,,,,1517,8,1505,3,"Four Waldburg Dolerite sills have been dated by SHRIMP using zircons extracted from felsic portions of the sills. On MOUNT AUGUSTUS, zircon from late, felsic fractionates gave a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* age of 1517 Â± 8 Ma (GSWA 206916, Wingate et al., 2015a). Zircon from granophyric veinlets crosscutting the dolerite on MOUNT AUGUSTUS, gave a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* age of 1513 Â± 5 Ma (GSWA 206991, Wingate et al., 2015b). A similar weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* age of 1513 Â± 4 Ma was obtained from zircon extracted from a very coarse-grained leucogabbro patch within mainly medium-grained dolerite on MANGAROON (GSWA 207259, Wingate et al., 2013). The youngest age (weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* age) of 1505 Â± 3 Ma was obtained from zircon extracted from medium- to coarse-grained dolerite on CANDOLLE (GSWA 143445, Wingate et al., 2012).   These ages are considered to date the timing of emplacement and igneous crystallization of the Waldburg Dolerite, and are strong evidence that the lower part of the Edmund Group is intruded by dolerite sills significantly older than the c. 1465 Ma Narimbunna Dolerite (Wingate, 2002). Three samples yield a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1514 Â± 3 Ma (MSWD = 0.45). A fourth sample, at 1505 Â± 3 Ma, is significantly younger. All four samples yield a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date of 1510 Â± 9 Ma, but with a large MSWD of 5.8 indicating dispersion beyond that attributable to analytical precision. The dolerite sills may have been intruded within a short interval at c. 1514 Ma, or possibly over a c. 9 Ma interval between c. 1514 and 1505 Ma.

3425,78876,P_-_wr-kt,1,Wallara Formation,1,"Dolomite, oolitic dolomite, sandstone, and siltstone; stromatolitic; commonly silicified to chert and sandy chert at surface","The Wallara Formation is a cyclical succession of dolomite, oolitic dolomite, sandstone, and siltstone that is commonly silicified to chert and sandy chert at surface. The carbonates are often stromatolitic, containing the distinctive form  Bacalia burra . The formation disconformably overlies the Bitter Springs Group, and is unconformably overlain by the Areyonga Formation. In Western Australia (WA) known outcrops of the formation are restricted to the Boord Ridges area where it is about 150 m thick, but the unit is more widespread in outcrop and drillholes in the Northern Territory (NT). A late Tonian age in the broad range of 800-720 Ma is inferred from stratigraphic position and biostratigraphy. The Wallara Formation forms the local top of Supersequence 1 of the Centralian Superbasin (Supersequence terminology of Walter et al., 1995).","In WA the only know exposures of the Wallara Formation are along the northern edge of the Boord Ridges (MACDONALD 1:100 000 map sheet area), where it is about 150 m thick, and around a syncline a few kilometres to the west. However, it is likely to be more widespread in the subsurface, particularly in the northern part of the basin (Haines and Allen, 2014). In the NT the Wallara Formation is recognised in several drill holes and sparsely in outcrop in the central and western areas (Haines and Allen, 2014, referring to the unit informally as 'Finke beds'). However, it is likely to be recognized in other areas once outcrops currently mapped as undivided Bitter Springs 'Formation' and Inindia beds are subdivided. ","The Wallara Formation is named after petroleum exploration well Wallara 1 in the NT (MGA Zone 53 230787E 7275207N). The type section is the interval 1512.12 m (base) to 1423.70 m (top) in Wallara 1, which is fully-cored (Australian stratigraphic units database, Geoscience Australia). The unit was first distinguished in NT petroleum exploration well Finke 1 where it was informally referred to as  Finke beds  (Gorter et al., 1983), and later in Wallara 1 (Indigo Oil and Sirgo Exploration, 1990). The first recognised outcrop of   Finke beds  was in the Boord Ridges in WA (Haines et al., 2010a,b), although subsequent outcrop was located in the NT. The term  Finke beds  was deemed invalid because the Devonian Finke Group is an established stratigraphic name in the same basin. The name Wallara Formation has been used to replace 'Finke beds' since 2014 (Australian stratigraphic units database, Geoscience Australia). In WA the unit was originally incorporated at the base of the now abandoned  Boord Formation , and was referred to as the  unnamed unit  in Haines and Allen (2014).",,"At the Boord Ridges the base of the Wallara Formation is marked by poorly exposed lithic sandstone with chert clasts. Outcrops above the base are composed mostly of grey-bedded chert and cherty sandstone. The chert clearly represents silicified sedimentary carbonate as it contains common relic ooids, stromatolites, and other carbonate textures. Lenticular bodies of buff-coloured stromatolitic dolomite that have escaped the extensive silicification are present locally near the middle of the unit. Stromatolites in both silicified carbonates and dolomite have been identified as  Bacalia burra  (Allen et al., 2012; Grey et al., 2012). In drillcore in the NT the unit consists of interbedded sandstone, ooid and stromatolitic carbonate (mainly dolomite) and red, green and black siltstone, and shale. Chert is common in carbonate units. The unit has a distinctive cyclical wireline log signature that can be identified in several wells in the upper part of an interval traditionally assigned to the Bitter Springs Formation.","The Wallara Formation was deposited under shallow marine shelf environment with varying water depth and energy conditions. The characteristic ooid carbonates indicate periods of shallow energetic (wave-swept) conditions, while common stromatolites are consistent with photic-zone deposition. However, intervals of black siltstone and shale in drill core in the NT suggest depositional conditions were periodically or locally deeper and quieter.   ",150,150,,"The Wallara Formation disconformably overlies the Johnnys Creek Formation of the Bitter Springs Group in the Northern Territory. In Western Australia the unit overlies undivided Bitter Springs Group in the Boord Ridges area (MACDONALD 1:250 000 map sheet area); this contact is overlain by lithic sandstone with chert clasts and although poorly exposed, is inferred to be disconformable (Haines and Allen, 2014). The Wallara Formation is unconformably overlain by the Areyonga Formation, and in many areas in the Northern Territory the unit has been completely removed by erosion prior to deposition of the Areyonga Formation. In the Boord Ridges area the base of the Areyonga Formation locally downcuts at least 50 m into the Wallara Formation in what appear to be channels (Haines and Allen, 2014). ",,17,,,,4,,,,800,,720,,"The Wallara Formation has not been directly dated in WA. U-Pb detrital zircon dating of a core sample from drill hole Wallara 1 in the NT yielded a maximum depositional age of 1006 Â± 13 Ma (Normington et al., 2016). However, this is much older than constraints from stratigraphic position and biostratigraphy which imply a late Tonian depositional age. In WA Wallara Formation contains the stromatolite  Bacalia burra  (Allen et al., 2012; Haines and Allen, 2014), while in Wallara 1 in the NT contains the distinctive acritarch  Cerebrosphaera buickii  in addition to  Bacalia burra , together indicating correlation with the Burra Group of the Adelaide Rift Complex and the upper Buldya Group of the western Officer Basin (Grey et al., 2011; Edgoose, 2013).",No,,,629,,No,DE in Progress,No,No,P_,_wr,,86,10,,MIGSDPH,2.02E+13,,Yes,No

","The Walsh Tillite is named after the type section of the tillite found at Walsh Creek, a tributary of the Adcock River (lat. 17 o 12'S, long. 125 o 35'E; Guppy et al., 1958). ",,"The Walsh Tillite is made of three lithofacies, although only two are seen in most areas. The basal lithofacies is a coarse-grained pebbly sandstone, seen only on the CHARNLEY 1:250 000 map sheet (Gellatly and Halligan, 1971; Gellatly et al., 1969).  The bulk of the formation is made of a thick diamictite interpreted as a tilllite; the 'tillite member' of Plumb (1981). The tillite is made of striated pebbles, cobbles, and boulders of well-rounded to angular quartzite (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967; Gellatly et al., 1969; Roberts and Perry, 1970; Gellatly and Halligan, 1971; Plumb, 1981; Griffin et al., 1993). Other, assecory clasts, are made of siltstone, dolomite, and igneous rocks (Griffin et al., 1993). The tillite is matrix-supported. The matrix varies slightly from a poorly sorted, clay-silt-sandstone material (MOUNT ELIZABETH 1:250 000; Roberts and Perry, 1970) to either a green or purple siltstone or shale matrix supporting scattered pebbles or cobbles (LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000; Griffin et al., 1993). The number of clasts decreases upwards (Plumb, 1981). The base of the tillite is marked by an angular unconformity with the underlying Kimberley Group. The base of the Walsh Tillite is either a laminated siltstone with rhythmic laminations grading into a massive siltstone (Walsh Creek area; MOUNT HOUSE 1:100 000; Jacob's Ladder sequence at 17o08'S, 125o51'E; Plumb, 1981), fine-grained, well-sorted, flaggy, pebbly, feldspathic- and quartz-sandstone (Mount Caroline area), or massive diamicite (east of Mount Clifton; MOUNT HOUSE 1:100 000; Plumb, 1981).  On top of the tillite is a layer of dolomitic material, up to 10 m thick. It is seen as a cream or yellow or pink dolomite with possible stromatolitic horizons in the Mount Caroline area (LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000; Griffin et al., 1993). On LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 the dolomite is similarly pink or yellow, thin-bedded, fine-grained, flaggy dolomite with local pyrite psuedomorphs, lenses of quartz sandstone, scattered erratics (sourced from the Speewah and Kimberley Groups), and massive algal dolomite (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967; Plumb, 1981; Corkeron, 2007). Algal structures are also seen in the dolomites on CHARNLEY 1:250 000 (Gellatly and Halligan, 1971).  ","Terrestrial glaciation is indicated by striated pavements on top of the Pentecost Sandstone (Kimberley Group; Roberts and Perry, 1970).

This supersuite outcrops throughout the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone, mainly on BELL ROCK and HOLT, and forms perhaps the most abundant felsic component in the Mamutjarra Zone (mainly BLACKSTONE); no rocks of the Wankanki Supersuite are known to occur within the Walpa Pulka Zone (on BATES). The supersuite is dominated by intrusive rocks. However, fine-grained, laminated to banded, orthopyroxene-bearing rocks, whose protoliths are interpreted as volcanic or volcaniclastic rocks, also occur, particularly in the northwestern part of the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone. These volcanic-derived rocks are interlayered with metamorphosed clastic rocks of the 1340-1270 Ma Wirku Metamorphics; where the volcanic or volcaniclastic rocks dominate, the mixed unit has been assigned to the Wankanki Supersuite.  Rocks of the Wankanki Supersuite typically lie within the compositional range of quartz monzonite to syenogranite, with granodiorite to monzogranite being the dominant rock types. They are generally leucocratic, with up to 12% mafic minerals typically dominated by hypersthene, although the protoliths most likely crystallized hornblende and biotite. All have been metamorphosed to at least the upper amphibolite, and more typically the granulite, facies. The intrusive rocks are weakly to moderately foliated and porphyritic.

The supersuite is dominated by intrusive rocks. However, fine-grained, laminated to banded, orthopyroxene-bearing rocks, whose protoliths are interpreted to have been volcanic or volcaniclastic rocks, form part of the supersuite locally, particularly in the northwestern part of the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone. These volcanic or volcaniclastic rocks are often interbedded with metasedimentary units, forming various mixed units of both the Wankanki Supergroup and Wirku Metamorphics (e.g. P_-WN-xmf-mh, P_-WN-xmfn-mt, P_-WN-xmfn-mh). Volcanic or volcaniclastic units also form a minor component in the southwestern parts of BLACKSTONE, and in this area they are also assigned to the Wirku Metamorphics as a mixed unit of Wankanki Supergroup and Wirku Metamorphics (P_-_wm-xmh-mf).  No rocks of the Wankanki Supersuite are known to occur within the Walpa Pulka Zone (on BATES) to the north of the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone.","Howard et al. (2007) grouped all rocks with igneous crystallization ages falling between c. 1345 and c. 1293 Ma into the Wankanki Supersuite, and termed the crustal event that produced them the Mount West Orogeny. The term  Wankanki  is derived from the local (Pitjantjatjara dialect) name for Mount West ( Puli Wankanki ), located in the central part of BELL ROCK, which is the type locality for this supersuite.",,"Intrusive rocks of the Wankanki Supersuite typically lie within the compositional range of quartz monzonite to syenogranite, with granodiorite to monzogranite being the dominant rock types. All have been metamorphosed to at least the upper amphibolite, and more typically the granulite, facies, and show a correspondingly wide range of primary and secondary textures and mineralogies. Most samples of intrusive rocks from the Wankanki Supersuite have microtextures that range from hypidiomorphic granular to granoblastic polygonal. The rocks are generally leucocratic, with up to 12% mafic minerals. Weakly metamorphosed examples preserve an igneous mineralogy that includes hornblende > biotite, with clinopyroxene cores to hornblende. More commonly, a high-grade metamorphic assemblage includes hypersthene > biotite > clinopyroxene and hornblende (both green and brown varieties). Where the rocks are porphyritic, perthitic K-feldspar is typically the dominant phenocryst phase, although many samples also contain abundant plagioclase phenocrysts, and plagioclase itself is commonly antiperthitic.  In the area south of the Hinckley Range (on BELL ROCK) and west of Mount Aloysius (on HOLT), many exposures of the Wankanki Supersuite consist of weakly to moderately foliated and porphyritic rock, with tabular to subrounded perthite, and lesser plagioclase phenocrysts to 2 cm. Phenocryst-poor, seriate-textured equivalents also occur in this region. To the west of MacDougall Bluff and south of Peak Hill (on BLACKSTONE), the rocks are moderately to highly porphyritic, with tabular K-feldspar phenocrysts, to 3 cm in size, forming up to 60% of the rock. These phenocrysts are locally strongly aligned, in places defining a trachytic flow-texture. In other areas, for example around Mount West (central BELL ROCK) and in the southern parts of BLACKSTONE, the rocks show a range of metamorphic fabrics from a weakly developed gneissic banding to a strong gneissosity, and metatexitic to diatexitic migmatite is locally well developed. Some outcrops in these areas include panels of migmatite and migmatitic schlieric leucogranite.  The foliation and gneissic banding developed in rocks of the Wankanki Supersuite trends to the northwest within the southeastern part of the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone (on BELL ROCK), whereas the trend is typically to the northeast in the southern BLACKSTONE area. In the former region, leucosomes and veins of migmatitic melt are mostly foliation-parallel, but can locally cut the foliation. Compositionally uniform, unfoliated to strongly foliated, leucogranite dykes that crosscut the Wankanki Supersuite have been sampled from the area north of Mount West and dated (GSWA 183509, Kirkland et al., 2007). The crystallization age of 1165 Â± 10 Ma obtained from these rocks likely represents the age of deformation in this area. Dating of zircon overgrowths in Wankanki Supersuite rocks from throughout the west Musgrave Province provides a range of metamorphic ages that span the entire Musgrave Orogeny. The main northwest-trending foliation seen in the west Musgrave Province was either produced or rotated (to the northwest) during the Musgrave Orogeny (White et al., 1999; Betts et al., 2002; Belperio, 2009). In contrast, in the southern BLACKSTONE area where neither the regional northwest-trending foliation nor the magmatism related to the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite are strongly developed, the gneissic banding seen in rocks of the Wirku Metamorphics and the Wankanki Supersuite is folded about a northeast-trending fold axis. Here, rare 1-2 m wide dykes of unfoliated porphyritic syenogranite belonging to the Pitjantjatjara Supersuite, intrude parallel to the fold-axis. Dating of these Pitjantjatjara Supersuite granite dykes constrains the minimum age of the foliation and folding in this region to 1201 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 184146, Kirkland et al., 2009a). It is thus likely that the strong northeast-trending foliation seen in the rocks of the Wankanki Supersuite and the Wirku Metamorphics reflects a deformation event that pre-dates the Musgrave Orogeny. This suggestion is consistent with previous observations that the rocks of the Wirku Metamorphics in the Mount Aloysius region (in the northwest of BELL ROCK) show at least two phases of deformation that pre-date the intrusion of Pitjantjatjara Supersuite magmas.  Inclusions of metasedimentary rocks belonging to the Wirku Metamorphics are found in many exposures of the Wankanki Supersuite. In the vicinity of Mount West (central BELL ROCK), rafts of metasedimentary rock are up to several hundred metres long, whereas in the southern part of BLACKSTONE, aeromagnetic data suggests the presence of rafts up to several kilometres in length.  The rocks of the Wankanki Supersuite are metaluminous, and calcic to calc-alkalic. They show a strong compositional similarity to Phanerozoic granites in continental-arcs, including strong enrichments in barium and relative depletions in niobium (e.g. high La/Nb ratios), although they are generally dominated by more silica-rich rocks, with most Wankanki granites containing >65 wt% SiO2. Wankanki rocks consistently fall within the field for volcanic-arc granites in tectonic discrimination diagrams, and in this respect they differ from most other granites in the west Musgrave Province, which tend to lie within the within-plate granites field (Smithies et al., 2009).

Approximately 20 samples have been dated within this range, with most dates lying within a narrow period between c. 1326 and 1312 Ma (White et al., 1999; Kirkland et al., 2008, 2009b; summarized in Smithies et al., 2009).",No,,,75,,No,Published,Yes,Yes,P_,WN,,25,5,,MIGSDAR,2.02E+13,2.02E+13,No,No

Textures are typically hypidiomorphic granular.",,,,,"Contacts developed between this granite and its associated gabbro (P_-WKH-og) range from clearly brittle (i.e. granite intruding solid gabbro) to clearly ductile. Three main types of contacts occur: 1) granites intruded as xenolithic blebs, lenses, or curvilinear segregations, up to 5 cm in length; 2) co-mingled granite and gabbro forming agmatites (see WAROX site RHSMU500 &mdash; MGA 472977E 7119080N &mdash; in the west Hinckley Range, for spectacular examples); and 3) gabbros mixed with granite to form hybrid magmas. In the first two occurrences, boundaries between the mafic and felsic phases are curvilinear, cuspate, and cauliform, indicating that neither phase was solid during emplacement, and further suggesting that the phases were coeval. However, gabbros containing syn-magmatic granitic blebs are agmatized by the same granite, indicating that granite magmatism was continuous during emplacement of the gabbro.  Many of these granite dykes are also syn-magmatic shear zones, some containing examples where mylonitic, mixed granite-gabbros are intruded by slightly younger granites. In the west Hinckley Range, a slightly earlier generation of granite dykes is folded about a northwest fold plane, with younger granites then intruded along the fold plane. Elsewhere (GSWA 185509: MGA 471391E 7120896N), the granite has pooled into boudin necks within syn-magmatic mylonite zones. The granite blebs that contaminate gabbros are excellent markers, which usually define a moderate to strong foliation or lineation. Bleb margins still remain wispy and cuspate during this deformation, also suggesting that the deformation was syn-magmatic. These granite contaminated gabbros of the Murray Range were emplaced into a 5-10 km wide, north-northwesterly trending, subvertical, sinistral oblique shear zone, which marks the northeastern boundary of the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone.

Its name derives from the Warrawoona mining centre, where Maitland (1905) used the name  Warrawoona Beds  to describe the greenstone succession. The group consists of four subgroups (Van Kranendonk et al., 2006; Hickman, 2010) containing a total of ten formations: 3525-3490 Ma Coonterunah Subgroup (Tabletop, Coucal, and Double Bar Formations), 3490-3477 Ma Talga Talga Subgroup (North Star Basalt, McPhee and Dresser Formations), 3477-3463 Ma Coongan Subgroup (Mount Ada Basalt and Duffer Formation), and 3463-3427 Ma Salgash Subgroup (Apex Basalt and Panorama Formation). Each of these subgroups contains at least one ultramafic-mafic-felsic volcanic cycle (Hickman and Van Kranendonk, 2004). Deposition of the upper sections of each volcanic cycle was accompanied by extensional growth faulting, and associated clastic and chemical sedimentary rocks locally preserve evidence of early life in hydrothermal and locally shallow-water environments.  The basal contact of the group is intrusive with granitic rocks, but is also commonly sheared. The group is unconformably overlain by low-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Strelley Pool Formation (Hickman, 2008), but where this formation is absent it is unconformably overlain by the 3426-3315 Ma Kelly Group. The thickness of the group reaches a maximum of 15 000 m in the Marble Bar greenstone belt.   The metamorphic grade of the group varies from high-temperature amphibolite- and rare granulite-facies assemblages within, and adjacent to, granitic complexes, to greenschist facies with increasing distance up stratigraphic section and away from intrusive granitic contacts.  Deposition of the Warrawoona Group was accompanied by the emplacement of syn-volcanic granitic intrusions of the Callina Supersuite (3490-3460 Ma) and the Tambina Supersuite (3450-3420 Ma).  ","The Warrawoona Group is exposed in 12 of the 20 greenstone belts of the East Pilbara Terrane, and is interpreted to be present at depth with some of the remaining 8 greenstone belts. Its depositional distribution probably exceeded 40,000 km2.","Warrawoona mining centre, Latitude 21 degrees 20 mins. South, Longitude 119 degrees 54 mins. East.",,"The Warrawoona Group is predominantly composed of mafic and felsic volcanic rocks that form the major parts of stacked volcanic cycles. Fully preserved cycles commence with ultramafic volcanic rocks, including peridotitic and basaltic komatiite, typically metamorphosed at greenschist facies. These ultramafic volcanic rocks commonly include sills of metadunite, metaperidoite, and metapyroxenite. Serpentinization is widespread, and most of the rocks are foliated to schistose.  The main part of each volcanic cycle is generally basaltic, and chiefly composed of massive and pillowed tholeiite (metamorphosed) with thin units of chert. The chert units are typically less than 10 m thick, but are underlain by much thicker zones of silicification in which altered basalt contains veins of black silica or quartz. The cherts are mostly grey-and-white banded varieties, but ferruginous chert and banded iron-formation are also locally present. Most of the cherts are not primary deposits (entirely hydrothermal) but were formed by silicifiication of fine-grained siliciclastic or volcaniclastic rocks at the top of lava units. Overlying the basaltic sections of the volcanic cycles are felsic volcanics mainly consisting of dacite lavas and volcaniclastic rocks, but locally including rhyolite. Felsic sections up to several kilometres thick are present in the Duffer and Panorama Formations, but elsewhere in the group are generally less than 100 m thick. Small subvolcanic felsic intrusions of porphyritic dacite or rhyolite in the Duffer and Panorama Formations locally contain base-metal mineralization. The tops of most volcanic cycles include units of metamorphosed volcaniclastic sandstone, shale, and chert, locally including lthin iron formations. Thin carbonate units are locally present, but are typically silicified.

375,19549,P_-KMw-st,4719,Warton Sandstone,1,White to buff quartz sandstone and feldspathic sandstone; siltstone interbeds; minor hematitic sandstone,"The c. 1800 Ma Warton Sandstone is a succession of well-indurated, ridge- and cliff-forming, orthoquartzites and feldspar-dominated sandstones with subordinate siltstone and rare conglomerate. The formation is conformable within the Kimberley Group, overlying the Carson Volcanics and underlying the Elgee Siltstone. It is exposed throughout the Kimberley Basin but mainly outcrops in the central Kimberley region along the northeast-trending Carson Escarpment and Durack Range and various other smaller ranges in the west Kimberley region.  Lithofacies in the Warton Sandstone consist of either quartz-dominated or feldspar-dominated sandstone units. Sandstone beds contain a variey of sedimentary structures. Thicker bedded sandstones are ubiquitously cross-bedded. Thinner bedded sandstones are ripple laminated or contain planar parallel laminations. Orthoquartzites preserve fewer sedimentary structures.  The Warton Sandstone contains many sedimentary structures indicative of tidal and nearshore processes, including herringbone cross-stratification, flaser bedding, desiccation cracks, bidirectional current structures (symmetrical ripples). The formation is highly cross-bedded in thicker bedded sandstones indicating a paleocurrent from the northwest.  A mean SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 1797 Â± 11 Ma from the intrusive Hart Dolerite provide a minimum age of deposition of the lower Kimberley Group, including the Warton Sandstone.","The Warton Sandstone is a very well induriated package which forms prominent ridges, cliffs, and cuestas throughout the Kimberley region. The weathering resistant Warton Sandstone commonly forms steep cliffs in contact with the underlying and more highly weathered Carson Volcanics.  In the west Kimberley region the formation forms the Macdonald Range and many of the islands in the Camden Sound area (PRINCE REGENT-CAMDEN SOUND 1:250 000 map sheet). To the southeast on CHARNLEY 1:250 000 the sandstone forms the Harding and Synnot Ranges and only outcrops on the southeast end of the King Leopold Ranges on LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 map sheet and the Barnett Range on MOUNT ELIZABETH 1:250 000. The Warton Sandstone is exposed in the Warton Range and the Tableland area around Yulumbu (Tableland) Homestead on the LANSDOWNE 1:250 000. The Warton Sandstone is cut by numerous rivers in this area making deep gorges (e.g. Crocodile Gorge, 25 km southwest of Yulumbu Homestead, and Teronis Gorge, 20 km west-southwest of Bedford Downs Homestead).  In the north Kimberley region the Warton Sandstone is exposed along the Carson Escarpment, forms part of the Gardner Plateau on ASHTON 1:250 000 map sheet and makes much of the coastal exposures on the western side of the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf (MEDUSA BANKS 1:250 000 map sheet).  The formation, like most of the Kimberley Group is exposed in a thin northeast-trending corridor in the Durack Range in the east Kimberley region and the also northeast-trending Saw and Deception Ranges towards Kununurra. Exposures in the Mueller Ranges on MOUNT RAMSAY 1:250 000 map sheet mark the southernmost extent of the formation in the Kimberley Basin.","The Warton Sandstone was probably named for the Warton Range in which it makes the dominant outcrops. The Warton Range is located approximately 50 km west of the Yulumbu (Tableland) Homestead and is cut at its northern end by the Tableland Road (Lat. -17&deg; 25' 18'' S, Long. 126&deg; 27' 30'' E). The Warton Sandstone first appears in the literature in the first edition explanatory notes of the LISSADELL 1:250 000 map sheet (Plumb, 1968).",,"The Warton Sandstone is an entirely sedimentary siliciclastic package of medium-grained, well-sorted, quartz sandstones, feldspathic sandstones (subarkose or arkose), with minor siltstone. The sandstones are commonly cross-bedded with foresets 30-100 cm thick (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967; Gellatly and Sofoulis, 1969; Gellatly et al., 1969).   The base of the Warton Sandstone is commonly a pink or purple, very thick- to thin-bedded, medium- or fine-grained, well-sorted subarkose or arkose. In the cliffs to the west of Teronis Gorge on BEDFORD 1:100 000 (at CXPLSN000141) the rocks are highly feldspathic, 70-80% feldspar. The sandstones are uncommonly massive but contain symmetrical ripples and ripple laminations (e.g. at CXPLSN000139 and CXPLSN000140, both to the west of Teronis Gorge), cross-bedding, planar parallel laminations, water escape structures, possible flaser bedding (CXPLSN000140), and possible desiccation cracks (CXPLSN000143; west of Teronis Gorge on BEDFORD). Features suggesting high current energies and erosion are also present including truncated bedding and intraclasts of purple siltstone within the sandstone beds. On BEDFORD 1:100 000 feldspathic sediments were interbedded with thin-bedded, massive, micaceous or recrystallised siltstone. Feldspathic sandstones are seen at the base of the Warton Sandstone in other areas in the Kimberley Basin (Gellatly et al., 1969; Gelltaly and Sofoulis, 1969; Plumb and Perry, 1971). In other outcrops on LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 and to the south on the MOUNT RAMSAY 1:250 000 map sheet, quartz sandstones dominate the formation (Gellatly and Derrick, 1967; Roberts et al., 1968, respectively).  Further to the west in the Kimberley region, on SULIVAN 1:100 000 (MOUNT ELIZABETH 1:250 000) the Warton Sandstone is a thick-bedded, white, fine-grained, well-sorted and recrystallised quartz arenite (orthoquartzite). Sedimentary structures were less well preserved here than on BEDFORD (probably due to the recrystallization) and include faint cross-bedding and rare soft sediment deformation (CXPMTE000253; where the Gibb River Road crosses the Gibb Range to the east of the Gibb River). This lithofacies contains very minor feldspar, possibly altered to kaolinite or other clay minerals giving the rock a powdery feel. On ASHTON 1:250 000 the upper Warton Sandstone consists of friable sandstone and siltstone with minor intraformational conglomerate with a muscovite-bearing matrix (Derrick, 1968). An obvious and abundant purplish haematitic siltstone and fine-grained feldspathic sandstone is seen in the middle of the formation on LENNARD RIVER 1:250 000 (Griffin et al., 1993).  A highly localised threefold subdivision of the Warton Sandstone occurs on Koolan Island, YAMPI 1:250 000, described with a lower thick-bedded, cross-bedded, medium- to coarse-grained sandstone (Jap Bay Member); a middle feldspathic sandstone and micaceous shale (Blinker Hill Sandstone); and an upper well-sorted quartz sandstone (Arbitration Cove Sandstone Member; Tyler and Griffin, 1993). Asymmetrical and interference ripples are ubiquitous in the Warton Sandstone on YAMPI (Tyler and Griffin, 1993). ","The Warton Sandstone was most likely deposited in a tidal to shallow marine setting with evidence for subaeral exposure. On BEDFORD 1:100 000 symmetrical ripples suggest bidirectional currents, with possible flaser bedding indicating a strong contrast in current energies with finer grained material deposited as mud drapes during a lull (possibly on a tidal flat or upper shoreface). Possible desiccation cracks suggest periods of subaerial exposure (i.e. the exposures to the west of Teronis Gorge on BEDFORD; CXPLSN000139-140). Thicker bedded sandstones are cross-bedded. Water escape structures (CXPLSN000140) and soft sediment deformation (CXPMTE000253; off the Gibb River Road in the Gibb Range) can be caused by waterlogged/oversaturated sediment leading to fluid movement and disruption of bedding and lamination syn- or post-deposition. Soft sediment deformation and water escape structures within cross-bedded sediment indicates rapid deposition within a high current energy setting.  Thick packages of feldspathic sandstone and quartz arenite suggest deposition in a stable basin sourced from a continental, probably granitic hinterland (Derrick, 1968). The cross-bedding in the thicker bedded feldspathic and quartzose sandstones might suggest a move away from the coastline, possibly to the lower shoreface, still above storm-wave base with active bottom currents.  The dominant paleoflows are from the west and northwest consistent with the rest of the Kimberley Group sediments (Derrick, 1968; Gellatly and Sofoulis, 1969; Gellatly et al., 1970). Local variations included palaeoflows from the northeast on YAMPI 1:250 000 (Tyler and Griffin, 1993), with interference ripples possibly indicating an estuarine setting or shallow embayment with ripples produced by both along-shore currents and tidal processes. On MEDUSA BANKS 1:250 000 paleoflows are from the northeast and north to the north of the map sheet and from the northwest to the south of the map sheet (Plumb and Perry, 1971).",90,900,,"The Warton Sandstone is part of a conformable sedimentary sequence within the Kimberley Group, conformable on top of the Carson Volcanics and under the Elgee Siltstone.  The contact between the Warton Sandstone and Elgee Siltstone on SULIVAN 1:100 000 is sharp (CXPMTE000252; where the Gibb River Road cuts through the Gibb Range). The contact is marked by a pronounced change from well-induriated, white, orthoquartzite (Warton Sandstone) to a buff-coloured, very soft micaceous quartz arenite (Elgee Siltstone). Similarly, the contact with the Carson Volcanics is commonly well-defined as the more easily weathered, low-lying volcanics and sediments change to cliff- and ridge-forming more competent sandstones.  In the central Kimberley region the formation is unconformably overlain by the Neoproterozoic glacial sediments of the Mount House Group. This unconformity is present in the Warton and Talbot Ranges close to the Tableland Road on the LANSDOWNE 1:250 000 map sheet and again approximately 25 km further to the north near to the Traine River.  Sills of the Hart Dolerite intrude the Warton Sandstone at all stratigraphic levels.",,17,,,,4,,,,1791,,1740,,"The Warton Sandstone gradationally to conformably overlays the Carson Volcanics with no obvious depositional hiatus. Detrital zircon geochronology from the Warton Sandstone was reported in Kirkland et al. (2010). GWSA 182104 yielded significant age components at c. 2517, 2035, 1900 and 1856 Ma with a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* maximum depositional date of 1862 Â± 17 Ma (Kirkland et al., 2010). However, this maximum depositional age is older than the youngest magmatic zircons analysed from the Whitewater Volcanics that conformably underlay the Kimberley Basin. The Whitewater Volcanics, part of the Paperbark Supersuite in the Western Zone of the Lamboo Province, have yielded igneous crystallisation ages of 1857 Â± 4, 1854 Â± 5 (Griffin et al., 2000), 1854 Â± 6 (Lu et al., 2016) and 1849 Â± 6 Ma (Worden et al., 2008). A better constraint on the timing of sedimentation in the Warton Sandstone can be made using the Hart Dolerite. Sills of the Hart Dolerite extensively intruded the Speewah Group and lower Kimberley Group. Dolerite sills are contiguous with basalt lava in the Carson Volcanics and together constitute the Hart-Carson Large Igneous Province. Sheppard et al. (2012) reported U-Pb ages from a granophyric unit within the Hart Dolerite at 1799 Â± 17 Ma from zircon (GA 8759.8003) and 1795 Â± 15 Ma from baddeleyite (GSWA 113574). A minimum age of 1791 Â± 8 Ma was provided from sample GSWA 206156 by Wingate et al. (in prep). The minimum age of the Hart-Carson LIP at c. 1791 Ma is considered a reasonable maximum age of deposition of the Warton Sandstone.  A minimum depositional age for the Warton Sandstone (and the rest of the upper Kimberley Group) is provided by a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age from the Wotjulum Porphyry that intrudes the Elgee Siltstone, from the top of the Warton Sandstone to the base of the Pentecost Sandstone, in the Yampi Sound area. The Wotjulum Porphyry was dated at 1740 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 95406, Wingate et al., 2011; Sheppard et al., 2012).",No,,,4,,No,DE in Progress,No,Yes,P_,KMw,,,,,MIGMBCP,2.02E+13,,No,No

",,"This unit is primarily monzogranite, although there is minor granite and granodiorite. The monzogranite is pink, medium- to coarse-grained, typically massive, and ranges from equigranular through seriate-textured to weakly porphyritic. The weakly prophyritic phase is common in the centre of the pluton and has scattered cm-scale euhedral, tabular feldspars, which define a weak flow alignment, in an equigranular, medium-grained groundmass of feldspar, quartz and biotite. The feldspars forms a mosaic of interlocking, subhedral, 3-5 mm grains. The quartz is clear (suggesting that no, or little pervasive solid-state strain is recorded by the body) and forms both equant 2-3 mm diameter grains that are interstitial with the feldspars, and interstitial grains.The biotite forms equant aggregates that are up to 4 mm in diameter. Quartz generally makes up 25-30% of the rock, and biotite biotite is locally abundant, ranging from 5-15%. Magnetite was observed at some outcrops. The monzogranite is cut by late, east-northeastly trending joints and quartz veins, both of which are associated with epidote and silica alteration of the host rock. ",,,,,"The ovoidal, massive monzogranite pluton intrudes the Mount Venn greenstone belt, sharply cutting the pervasive solid-state foliation in the greenstones. At one location (MJPJUT000059: JUTSON at 541553 6906115), the host andesite is cut at a high angle to bedding by the monzogranite and hornfelsed.

However, this informal unit is characterized by the absence of dolerite and is only locally developed, mainly in the western Hamersley Basin. The absence of dolerite sills in this unit allows the identification of conformable contact relationships between the Yandicoogina Shale Member below and the Woongarra Rhyolite above. Textural and mineralogical characteristics suggest that the depositional environment was similar to that of the underlying Brockman Iron Formation, viz. a deep-water basin below storm wave base. The age of the Weeli Wolli Formation is moderately well constrained between c. 2451 and 2449 Ma.",Outcrops of Weeli Wolli Formation without dolerite sills are primarily restricted to the far western part of the Hamersley Basin on the 1:250 000 map sheets YARRALOOLA and WYLOO. The apparent thickness of this informal member is variable due to the product of structural effects (i.e. folding and faulting). The best exposures around the eastern closure of the Wyloo anticline have a true thickness of about 200 m. The distribution of the unit is difficult to determine accurately due to the difficulty to distinguish dolerite from shale in aerial photo interpretations.,"This informal member level unit takes its name from the parent Weeli Wolli Formation. No type section has been proposed, but representative exposures can be found in the vicinity of DMMHAM000208 (Zone, 50, MGA 462226E 7482285N) DMMHAM000286 (Zone 50, MGA 426821E 7546558N), and DMMHAM000411 (Zone 50, MGA 414978E 7587934N).",,"The BIFs of the Weeli Wolli Formation are distinctively red in colour and conspicuously laminated and in marked contrast to those of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation, Dales Gorge Member, or Joffre Member. Two distinct facies of Weeli Wolli Formation BIF have been identified by Trendall and Blockley (1970). The most common is the 'striped facies'. They consists of alternating red jaspilitic chert and white chert laminae with a thickness of 2-5 mm, which form fissile sheets similar to slate when weathered. Each stripe contains very fine microbands that are not usually distinguishable in the field. In the second facies, material resembling the  striped facies  acts as chert matrix for thickly microbanded red or white chert mesobands that resemble those of the Joffre Member. The thick microbanding of the associated cherts distinguishes them from those of the Dales Gorge or Joffre Members. Shale within the Weeli Wolli Formation is poorly exposed. It consists of siltstone and mudstone that is compositionally similar to other shales of the Hamersley Group (Davy, 1992). In addition to BIF and shale, this informal member of the Weeli Wolli Formation also contains localized evidence for extrusive mafic magmatism in the form of thin basalt flows and associated mafic volcaniclastic sandstone, especially in the vicinity of DMMHAM000392 (Zone 50, MGA 422953E 7549942N) and DMMHAM000287 (Zone 50, MGA 426789E 7546456N).","The depositional environment of the Weeli Wolli Formation is difficult to determine accurately due to the poor outcrop, especially of the shaly and basaltic intervals. However, textural and mineralogical characteristics suggest that the environment was similar to that of the underlying Brockman Iron Formation, viz. a deep-water basin below storm wave base. The Weeli Wolli Formation is interpreted to record pelagic to hemipelagic sedimentation with localized effusive mafic volcanism on a submarine continental shelf (Barley et al., 1997), followed by dolerite intrusion prior to regional deformation during the Ophthalmia Orogeny. According to Davy (1992), intrusion of the dolerite sills may have happened during BIF deposition. Davy (1992) also interprets a syndepositional volcaniclastic contribution that has felsic to intermediate geochemistry in the lower part of the formation, and mafic to ultramafic composition in the upper part.   Microband pairs within chert and chert matrix of the Hamersley Group have been interpreted by Trendall (1972) as varves, with each microband representing one year of deposition of colloidal chemical precipitates (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). Furthermore, colour variations that give the Weeli Wolli Formation its characteristic striping at the mesoband scale are comprised of an average of 23.3 Â± 0.3 microbands. This resulted in a cylicity that was initially correlated with the double sunspot or Hale cycle by Trendall (1973), and later interpreted by Walker and Zahnle, (1986) to reflect the climatic effects of the lunar nodal tides. However, the origin of microbanding within Hamersley Group BIF remains contentious. Recent studies suggest that the primary sediments were not solely the product of pelagic settling of colloidal chemical precipitates (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2003; Pickard et al., 2004). Much of the present-day mineralogical composition is rather the product of post-depositional processes and therefore not a proxy for the oceanic or atmospheric chemistry (Bekker et al., 2014; Rasmussen et al., 2016).",,200,,"The original definition of the Weeli Wolli Formation by MacLeod et al. (1963) did not specify any contact relationships, which are difficult to place precisely due to the intrusion of the dolerite sills in most areas. In the absence of dolerite sills in this informal unit, the base is taken as the base of the first BIF unit above the Yandicoogina Shale Member, and the top as the first appearance of rhyolite. However, contact relationships are rarely well exposed because of extensive weathering and Cenozoic cover.",,8,,,,5,,,,2451,,2449,,"The maximum age of the Weeli Wolli Formation is 2454 Â± 3 Ma, which is the best estimate of the minimum age of tuffaceous mudrocks [i.e. the black porcellanite of Trendall (1969)] in the underlying Joffre Member (Pickard, 2002). The minimum age is constrained by a 2449 Â± 3 Ma age for the overlying Woongarra Rhyolite (Barley et al., 1997). In addition, Barley et al. (1997) dated a tuffaceous sandstone within the Weeli Wolli Formation at Coondiner Gorge at 2449 Â± 3 Ma, which is identical to the age they obtained from a tuffaceous horizon in the overlying Woongarra Rhyolite. The depositional age of the Weeli Wolli Formation is therefore likely to be close to c. 2449 Ma.

It marks the top of the mineralized horizon in the Mount Newman Member of the underlying Marra Mamba Iron Formation. The thickness of the West Angela Member is highly variable, primarily due to dissolution and fluid flow associated with the formation of high-grade iron ore deposits at the top of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation. The West Angela Member conformably overlies the Mount Newman Member of the underlying Marra Mamba Iron Formation and is gradationally overlain by the Paraburdoo Member. Five shaly horizons separated by banded iron-formation (BIF), chert, or massive dolomite are recognized in the West Angela Member and were deposited during an abrupt cessation of BIF sedimentation that marks a change to mixed siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentation during a relative sea-level fall and progradation of slope-to-basin facies tied to a carbonate platform to the north and northeast.

Near the base, there is a distinctive unit of interbedded chert, BIF, dolomitic shale, and shale with characteristic natural gamma-ray peaks that are designated AS1 to AS3 (Blockley et al., 1993). By some mining companies this entire interval is referred to as A1 (Kepert, 2018) and is overlain by a thick interval of shale and dolomitic shale (AS3). The middle of the member, between AS3 and AS 4, contains a unit of massive to laminated crystalline dolomite with local carbonaceous shale and siltstone partings (Blockley et al., 1993). The upper part of the West Angela Member (AS4 to AS5) consists mainly of dolomitic shale and shale with minor chert beds that is gradationally overlain by massive dolomite at the base of the Paraburdoo Member. Lateral correlations between drillholes WRL 1 and FVG 1 suggest that the member becomes shalier towards the east (Blockley et al., 1993).","Deposition of the West Angela Member reflects an abrupt cessation of BIF deposition and a change to mixed siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentation. By analogy with depositional environments determined for the upper Hamersley Group (KrapeÅ¾ et al., 2004; Pickard et al., 2004), this change can be related to a relative sea-level fall and progradation of slope-to-basin facies related to a carbonate platform to the north and northeast.

It is similar in composition to the thicker shale macrobands of the underlying Dales Gorge Member, consisting of varying proportions of shale, chert, carbonate, and BIF, although the shales tend to be more carbonaceous and pyritic. The Whaleback Shale Member is interpreted to have been deposited in a deep-marine pelagic to hemipelagic environment in front of a carbonate platform in response to a relative sea-level fall between c. 2464 and 2461 Ma.","The Whaleback Shale Member is approximately 30-50 m thick and is found throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region on the 1:250 000 maps sheets DAMPIER, YARRALOOLA, PYRAMID, WYLOO, MOUNT BRUCE, ROY HILL, TUREE CREEK, NEWMAN, and ROBERTSON where it forms a conspicuous recessive unit within the Brockman Iron Formation, which is useful for regional correlation and interpretation of aerial photographs.","The Whaleback Shale Member was first recognized as a significant stratigraphic marker by MacLeod (1966), who referred to it as the  Mount Whaleback Shale Member . The abbreviated name was introduced by Trendall and Blockley (1968) and formalized by Trendall and Blockley (1970). The type section of the Whaleback Shale Member is defined by Trendall and Blockley (1970) as the interval between 195.7 m and 261.2 m in drillhole W47A of the Australian Blue Asbestos Company Pty Ltd. It was drilled near Wittenoom and the core is stored in the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) Core Library at Carlisle. The name is derived from Mount Whaleback (Zone 50, MGA 773190E 7413928N) west of Newman where it was first used as a marker for mapping of the Mount Whaleback iron ore deposit (Ryan and Blockley, 1965). Good outcrops of the member can be found in the upper parts of Wittenoom Gorge and its tributary Bismarck Gorge (Zone 50, MGA 636060E 7529940N), and a well-exposed and accessible reference section is present in Cathedral Gorge (Zone 50, MGA 768555E 7423647N) on the Great Northern Highway 15 km northwest of Newman.  The Whaleback Shale Member can be further subdivided into two informal zones based on the recognition of BIF, cherty BIF, and shale macrobands (Harmsworth et al., 1990). The lower zone consists of alternating BIF or cherty BIF macrobands (WB1 and WB2) and shale macrobands (WS1 and WS2). The base of the unit is marked by WS1. The upper zone consists of numerous mesobands of chert and shale (WS3) that passes gradationally into the overlying Joffre Member. The WB2 macroband is a distinctive cherty BIF that is about 3 m thick and characterized by undulose to wavy banding. It is also known as the  Central Chert Marker  (Kepert, 2018).",,"The Whaleback Shale Member is similar in composition to the thicker  S  macrobands of the underlying Dales Gorge Member, consisting of varying proportions of shale, chert, carbonate, and BIF. The dominant lithology is shale. Two types are recognized, viz. finely banded shale with graded bedding and obvious clastic textures, and massive, structureless stilpnomelane-rich rock.

Dolomitization of stromatolites and limestone is common - this has destroyed fine internal structure of most stromatolites. Displacive evaporite pseudomorphs and tepee structures (generally small) are common in sandstone and limestone beds, particularly in furrows and swales between stromatolite humps. Enterolithic deformation and medium- to large-scale cauliflower-like deformation, small cherty nodules and halite pseudomorphs and salt hoppers all indicate intermittently hypersaline conditions, with significant evaporite deposition and later withdrawal.  Stromatolites range from large domes to &quot;boat keel&quot;-shaped, locally with small parasitic forms on or comprising larger domes. Elongation generally indicates a wave translation direction of about 160 degrees along a north-facing coastline. Indistinct, metre-scale cyclicity is apparent locally, with sharp-based cycles grading up from sandstone, overlain by calcareous siltstone, and capped by stromatolitic limestone, each 4 to 5 m thick.  The major outcrop area is between Wells 7 and 8 on the Canning Stock Route, and a large evacuated diapir is apparent from the large-scale cauliflower-like outcrop pattern of the Willy Willy Formation. A single outcrop of microbial dolomite has been found along the south side of the Carnarvon Range on METHWIN (shown as  P_l  on METHWIN, and  P_MSy  on Nabberu 1:250 000 sheet). The formation was shown as  P_MOc  on RHODES and MUDAN.","The Willy Willy Formation has been recognized in outcrop in the core of the Scorpion Diapir, and stromatolitic dolomite that is probably part of the formation has been noted further west, in a poorly exposed fault sliver 2 km southeast of the southern Carnarvon Range (Hocking et al., 2003). The thickness is unknown but could be a couple of kilometres, and was probably altered significantly by salt withdrawal and expulsion. The indications of halotectonic diapirism are unmistakeable in outcrop and on aerial imagery, but the timing of salt movement is unknown and no evaporites have been recognized (not unsurprisingly) in outcrop.","The Willy Willy Formation was named by Hocking et al.

No type section has been measured, and a single section may be not possible because of diapiric contortion. The type area is here specified as the limestone- and siltstone-dominated area, with halotectonic diapiric deformation, extending about 6 km directly east of Willy Willy Bore and the Canning Stock Route. The upper contact with the Millury Formation is poorly exposed, and the lower contact with the Wonyulgunna Sandstone is inferred but probably transitional.",,"The Willy Willy Formation consists of stromatolitic limestone and siltstone, soft grey calcareous siltstone, and sandstone, generally fine-grained. The siltstone is generally recessive, and individual separate stromatolite domes are common within it at some levels. Microbial intraclast breccia forms the cores of some stromatolites, and extends between domes in places. Displacive evaporite pseudomorphs and tepee structures (generally small) are common in sandstone and limestone beds, particularly in furrows and swales between stromatolite humps. Small cherty nodules are present locally and may be after evaporites. Small halite pseudomorphs and salt hoppers are present but not common in sandstone beds.  Limestone beds are commonly 1 to 2 m thick, and show enterolithic deformation and medium- to large-scale cauliflower-like deformation. Dolomitization is common, particularly of stromatlites where it has largely destroyed the fine internal structure of the stromatolites. Carbonate beds are generally thin-bedded with mud wisps and partings, siltstone and (less commonly) sandstone intercalations up to about 15 cm thick, and are variably stromatolitic. Stromatolites range from large domes to &quot;boat keel&quot;-shaped, locally with small parasitic forms on or comprising larger domes. Branching digitate stromatolites, growing in siltstone, are less common. Elongation generally indicates a wave translation direction of about 160 degrees and a north-facing coastline.  Sandstone is present as laterally persistent beds generally less than a metre thick. It is generally parallel laminated to thin-bedded, with rippled surfaces and small-scale cross-bedding in places. Clay flakes and siltstone laminae are common, and dessication cracks in associated mudstone are present but rare. Coarse-grained sandstone is present locally.  Indistinct, metre-scale cyclicity is apparent locally, with sharp-based cycles grading up from sandstone, overlain by calcareous siltstone, and capped by stromatolitic limestone, each 4 to 5 m thick. In general, large domal stromatolites are overlain by &quot;boat keel&quot;-shaped stromatolites at cycle tops. The latter are more commonly certified, possibly reflecting mineral-rich fluids flowing through overlying sandstone beds.","The presence of unequivocal halotectonic deformation together with extensive intercalations of stromatolitic limestone and siltstone, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone indicate a coastal and sabhka setting that was intermittently barred and hypersaline. The major outcrop area is clearly an evacuated diaper from outcrop pattern and sedimentary structures. The grain size, parallel lamination to bedding, and low-amplitude ripples in associated sandstone intercalations are suggestive of washover structures into barred coastal lagoons with variable water depth and salinity. Stromatolite meadows may have developed both within these lagoons and in open, nearshore conditions based on local consistent elongation of stromatolites.",1000,3000,,The lower contact with the Wonyulgunna Sandstone is concealed and largely inferred.

The presence of a basal chert (P_MVc-cc) in the otherwise wholly siliciclastic Coonabildie Formation (Salvation Group) adjacent to the Scorpion Diapir on RHODES might be explained by expulsion and lateral migration of evaporitic fluids during the later part of the Mutherbuckin Event.",No,,,2,,No,DE in Progress,No,Yes,P_,MSy,,,,,MIGSDRH,2.02E+13,,No,No

McWhae et al. placed two of Tate's three informal units in their Wilson Bluff Limestone, but Ludbrook (1958) only accepted the lower unit, 'white polyzoal limestone', as Wilson Bluff Limestone. A significant disconformity was later confirmed at the top of the lower unit, and the middle unit was assigned to the Abrakurrie Limestone (Lowry (1970).

This section is 167 ft (50.9 m) thick, with no exposed base (Lowry, 1970).  The Wilson Bluff Limestone was included in the Eucla Group by most earlier workers (McWhae et al., 1958; Lowry, 1970), although the group was ignored by some (Hocking, 1990; Totterdell et al., 2000; Hou et al., 2011). The Wilson Bluff Limestone is here excluded from the Eucla Group, because a significant disconformity separates it from overlying late Oligocene-Miocene limestones still placed in the group, and it is the product of a quite distinct major transgression in the Middle-Late Eocene rather than a single long-lived transgressive phase (Clarke et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2011).",,,,,300,,,,17,,,,4,,,,41.3,,33.9,,,No,,,1,d,No,DE in Progress,No,No,GE,_wb,,,,,MIGSDRH,2.02E+13,,No,No

570,74875,A-ANwi-xony-am,571,Windimurra Igneous Complex,1,Layered gabbro and anorthosite with magnetitite and pyroxenite layers; includes younger gabbro and pyroxenite intrusions; metamorphosed,"The Windimurra Igneous Complex belongs to the Meeline Suite in the central Youanmi Terrane, western Yilgarn Craton and, with an areal extent of 2500 km&sup2;, is the largest known mafic-ultramafic intrusion in Australia . It has been subdivided into a number of lithological-stratigraphic components including ultramafic, lower, middle, upper, border, and roof zones. A magmatic feature known informally as the Shephards discordant zone separates eastern and western lobes of the complex. At the surface, each lobe hosts similar lithologies within their lower, middle, and upper zones. Their combined true thickness is estimated at 11 km. The western lobe of the complex contains late, pipe-like intrusions of mafic rocks, which have been assigned to the Corner Well Gabbro Member within the Complex.   The cumulative thickness of the layers of gabbroic and ultramafic rocks of the Windimurra Igneous Complex exposed at the surface is 13 km. Layers show lateral aggradation (offlap). Igneous layering is moderately to shallowly inward-dipping towards the central part of the complex.   The ultramafic zone is not exposed at the surface as part of the contiguous igneous stratigraphy. The border zone of metadolerite along the eastern side of the complex lies mainly between the lower zone rocks and sheared supracrustal rocks of the Norie Group. The roof zone outcrops in the central part of the eastern lobe of the complex and consists of several tabular units of plagioclase-phyric gabbro. Roof zone rocks have been intruded by granitic rocks of the Mount Kenneth Suite and intrude felsic volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member of the Norie Group.   A pegmatitic gabbro in the middle zone of the complex has been directly dated at 2813 Â± 3 Ma.   The Windimurra Igneous Complex hosts significant vanadium deposits within magnetitites in its upper zone.   ","The Windimurra Igneous Complex lies to the southeast of other complexes of the Meeline Suite. It is approximately 500 km north of Perth and 50 km east of the township of Mount Magnet (Zone 50, MGA 583147E 6895862N). The coherent main body of the complex extends for 85 km north-south and 37 km east-west, and covers an area of approximately 2500 km&sup2; on WYNYANGOO, WOODLEY, CHALLA, WINDIMURRA, COOLAMANINU, YOUANMI and BUNGAR. Metamorphosed and sheared lenses of the complex south and east of the main body, east of the Challa Shear Zone, are up to 25 km north-south and 5 km east-west, as estimated from aeromagnetic data.   The ultramafic zone is not exposed at the surface as part of the contiguous igneous stratigraphy. However, a three-kilometre-thick reflective region, interpreted from seismic-reflection data as ultramafic zone, underlies the lower zone (Ivanic et al., 2014a).   Seismic-reflection data show that the complex extends to depths of approximately 11 km below the surface (Ivanic and Brett, 2015). Hence the Windimurra Igneous Complex is thicker than the 8 km estimated for the Rustenberg Layered Series of the Bushveld Igneous Complex (Cawthorn and Walraven, 1998), previously the thickest such sequence of layered gabbroic rocks identified (Ivanic et al., 2017). It is deepest in its central part, indicated by a gravity high, and extends outwards with an approximate 20&deg; dip in a broad conical form towards the surface. The dip of the outer part of the complex has been steepened to about 70&deg; by shear zones, which mantle all but its southern margin.  ","The Windimurra Igneous Complex is named after the Windimurra Homestead (Zone 50, MGA 652000E 6866000N) on WINDIMURRA. Previously, it has been referred to as the 'Windimurra Complex' (Ahmat, 1986; Mathison et al., 1991; Mathison and Ahmat, 1996) and the 'Challa Intrusion' (Hockley, 1971), and also informally as 'Windimurra gabbro', 'Windimurra complex' and 'Windimurra intrusion'.  Names of the various zones of the Windimurra Igneous Complex are based on their lithological associations and the presence of particular cumulus indicator minerals such as magnetite and olivine. This nomenclature is adapted from terminology for classically described layered mafic-ultramafic igneous complexes such as the Stillwater Complex (e.g. McCallum et al., 1980), where ultramafic, lower, middle and upper 'series' are defined based on 'zone minerals' and lithological associations. The term 'series', however, is replaced with 'zone' as series is only used where intrusions are divided into a 'layered series' and an 'unlayered series' (cf. the Skaeergard Complex: Wager, 1960). Terminology such as 'Main Zone' and 'Critical Zone' for the Bushveld Complex are not utilized here, since these are used to separate rocks (and processes) specific to the Bushveld Complex (Wager and Brown, 1968).  The zones of the complex are: the border zone, which is so named as it bounds the outer contact of the complex with country rocks in the east; the ultramafic zone, which is characterized by an abundance of ultramafic rocks; the lower zone, which is defined by the presence of magnetite-free gabbroic rocks; the middle zone, which is defined by the incoming of magnetite (as an intercumulus phase) into predominantly gabbroic rocks; the upper zone, which is defined by the incoming of voluminous cumulate-magnetite-rich horizons; and the roof zone, which is defined by unlayered plutons near the upper contact of the complex. The Corner Well Gabbro Member is a formal member of the formation that consists of isolated, pipe-shaped, layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions that cut across layering in zones of the western lobe.  The type section for the Windimurra Igneous Complex (and the Meeline Suite as a whole: A-ANM-xony-amy) is described from east to west across the Windimurra Hills (Zone 50, MGA 653550E 6869000N) to the Windimurra vanadium openpit. The start of the traverse (TJIWIN000062, Zone 50, MGA 654321E 6869458N) is in the lower zone of the eastern lobe, where modally layered olivine gabbronorites and leucogabbros dominate. One kilometre to the west, intercumulus magnetite appears in the gabbroic lithologies, which marks the start of the middle zone. A late-stage, gabbroic pegmatite from within this part of the middle zone (CLKWIN090003, Zone 50, MGA 627876E 6880157N) has been dated at 2813 Â± 3 Ma (GSWA 194747, Wingate et al., 2012a), which is interpreted as the best estimate the age of the complex as a whole. At the western end of the traverse (TJIWIN000124, Zone 50, MGA 650233E 6869373N), thick cumulate horizons of magnetitite interlayered with leucogabbro, which indicate the start of the upper zone, can be seen in the walls of the Windimurra vanadium openpit. Ivanic (2016) describes a detailed traverse through this section (Localities 3.1-3.2). ",,"The overall stratigraphy of igneous layers of the Windimurra Igneous Complex and its division into various zones and lobes are based on lithological association, mineralogy, mineral chemistry, and 3D geometry: the latter modelled utilizing geological field observations, potential field data, and seismic-reflection imaging. The complex is lithologically similar to, but thicker than, many other large layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions worldwide. It is divided into seven parts: (1) The border zone mantles the northern and eastern parts of the complex in a thin layer of deformed metadolerite that separates lower zone rocks of the eastern lobe from deformed supracrustal rocks at the outer contact in the east. It may represent the chilled primary magma, although it is typically metamorphosed at lower amphibolite facies. (2) The ultramafic zone, which is not observed in outcrop as part of the contiguous complex, is characterized by abundant peridotite with disseminated chromite, and lesser gabbroic rocks. (3) The lower zone hosts olivine-rich gabbros and gabbronorites, which grade upwards into more leucocratic gabbroic rocks, typically without oxides. These lithologies are modally layered on a centimetre to metre scale, and they also show cyclicity on an approximately 200 m vertical scale. (4) The middle zone is composed of troctolitic rocks with intercumulus magnetite. Layering is similar to that in the lower zone. (5) The upper zone, which is also layered in a similar way to the lower zone, is marked by the incoming of significant thicknesses of cumulus magnetite, and the disappearance of Mg-olivine. Within a few hundred metres of the base of the upper zone, Fe-olivine appears as a cumulus phase in addition to magnetite. The uppermost parts of the upper zone are typically not exposed but appear to be composed dominantly of leucocratic rocks such as leuconorite and anorthosite. (6) The Corner Well Gabbro Member is a late phase of layered peridotite-gabbro pipes, <3 km in diameter, that intrude the middle and lower zones in the western lobe of the complex. (7) The roof zone hosts several kilometre-sized bodies of plagioclase-phyric gabbro and dolerite, which form a flatlying carapace across the eastern lobe of the complex. The upper part of the roof zone may represent the chilled contact zone with roof pendants of rhyolites of the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member. Granodiorite and tonalite of the Mount Kenneth Suite is in unexposed contact with the roof zone but is inferred to intrude this zone. The roof zone separates layered rocks of the complex from these overlying felsic rocks. Other unassigned components of the complex are sheared and deformed along the Challa Shear Zone to the south and west.   Granulite facies contact metamorphism at the margins of the complex is seen in pelitic xenoliths and wallrocks, which appear to be derived from rocks of the Norie Group. Thermobarometry of a contact-metamorphosed pelitic xenolith bounded by the roof zone, and by layered rocks of the lower zone of the complex indicates very shallow emplacement levels (Goscombe et al., 2012).   A horizon representing 1-3 km of discordance in the igneous stratigraphy, the Shephards discordant zone of Ahmat (1986), runs approximately north-south through the southern part of the complex. The discordant zone itself is not marked by observable changes in structural or magmatic features but is interpreted from its chemical discordance (Ahmat, 1986) and its geometric relationship to the eastern and western lobes (Ivanic and Brett, 2015). Each lobe shows fractionation from lower to middle and upper zones, and contains similar lithologies and layering styles.   Within the layered rocks of the complex &mdash; principally the lower, middle, and upper zones &mdash; megacyclic units, which are up to 300 m thick, show broad modal fractionation trends in their lithological constituents as a function of their position in the igneous stratigraphy. These lithologies contain more mafic minerals at their bases and more plagioclase at their tops. Ahmat (1986) showed that there were at least 13 reversals of geochemical fractionation (to more primitive mineral chemistry, e.g. in Mg# and V/Ti), which coincided with megacyclicity. These reversals were interpreted to represent new magma pulses.  Geophysical data &mdash; including gravity, magnetic, and seismic-reflection data &mdash; in the central Youanmi Terrane indicates the presence an approximately three-kilometres-thick, layered succession of ultramafic rocks that forms part of the Windimurra Igneous Complex at depth (Ivanic and Brett, 2015). This is interpreted to directly underlie the lower zone and to be contiguous with the main body of the complex. Seismic-reflection data suggest the presence of funnel-shaped, basal feeder system for the complex (Ivanic and Brett, 2015).  The layered rocks of the complex typically preserve cumulate textures, which are interpreted to be the result of crystal accumulation in a magma chamber. There are many examples of orthocumulate, mesocumulate and adcumulate textures, with crystal sizes 3-500 mm (typically 6-20 mm). Apart from the ultramafic lithologies, which are typically almost monomineralic adcumulates of olivine or pyroxene crystals, the majority of gabbroic lithologies have orthocumulate textures. They typically comprise chadacrysts of lath-shaped plagioclase 10 mm in long dimension, with oikocrysts of clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene about 20 mm across. Crystal zoning is not prominent in orthocumulate rock textures under the microscope. However, in a few examples (Ahmat, 1986), meso- and adcumulate rocks show extinction patterns that indicate oscillatory zoning in plagioclase and, rarely, core-rim distinction in pyroxenes. Pegmatitic and granophyric textures are locally abundant in gabbroic rocks. The roof and border zones are not modally layered and contain mainly subophitic to porphyritic textures.  Ahmat (1986) analysed chemical variation in olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase for the complex. Although there are local reversals in the chemical stratigraphy, the typical pattern from base to top is as follows. Forsteritic olivine, which disappears at the top of the middle zone, ranges in composition from approximately 90 to 64 (Fo mol. %). Olivine and then reappears in the upper zone as more fayalitic olivine that ranges from approximately 35 to 30 (Fo mol. %). The variation in Mg# for orthopyroxene is 85 to 60 (expressed as atomic % relative to Ca + Fet). The variation in Mg# for clinopyroxene is 87 to 54 (expressed as atomic % relative to Ca + Fet). The variation of the anorthite component in plagioclase is from 82 to 57 (An mol. %). ",,,,,"The Windimurra Igneous Complex is observed to be in contact with host rocks of the Norie Group, especially in the northeast. Here, doleritic border zone rocks commonly intrude between lower-zone gabbros and sheared supracrustal rocks with a steeply dipping contact (about 80&deg;) inwards towards the complex. They also form sills within supracrustal rocks in places. The contacts are interpreted to be modified primary contacts due to the presence of finer-grained (i.e. chilled margin) rocks.   Several contact-metamorphosed psammitic xenoliths from the lower zone of the complex have been examined (e.g. Ahmat, 1986). These are interpreted to be hornfelsed wallrocks of the Norie Group (A-NO-xmb-f). Contact metamorphic pressure estimates yield very low pressures (<1.0 kb), indicating a shallow emplacement depth for the upper parts of the complex (Goscombe et al., 2012).  Sheared contacts between the complex and Norie Group supracrustal rocks can be seen in several places. The clearest example is along the Wyemandoo Shear Zone in the southeastern part of the complex. This feature is a steeply dipping, 0.5-4 km-wide zone of supracrustal rocks with steep contacts, which is bounded by, and cuts across, igneous stratigraphy of various zones of the complex. Supracrustal rocks in a small (<200 m wide), northerly trending lens in the northwest of the complex (Zone 50, MGA 631492E 6896859N) are oriented parallel to the Yarloo Shear Zone to the northwest. They may represent rocks that have been incorporated into the complex during shearing or they may be a sheared xenolithic raft. The Challa Shear Zone, to the west of the complex, juxtaposes lenses of Norie Group supracrustal rocks &mdash; some of which have been dated at c. 2813 Ma (GSWA 198209, Wingate et al. 2015) &mdash; alongside the contiguous complex, and also alongside large sheared lenses of unassigned components of the complex.  The roof zone of the Windimurra Igneous Complex is interpreted to represent the chilled upper contact with the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member. For example, at TJIWIN090427 (Zone 50, MGA 645322E 6886149N), a harrisitic gabbro of the roof zone is in contact with a feldspar-phyric rhyodacite of the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member. Metatonalitic rocks of the Mount Kenneth Suite (e.g. A-ANK-gt; A-ANK-gg) intruded the lower and roof zones but these contacts are unexposed. However, rhyolitic dykes of the Mount Kenneth Suite are seen to intrude the complex (e.g. A-ANK-gnap: TJIWIN000225, Zone 50, MGA 640985E 6887419N).  The ultramafic zone may be in primary contact with basement gneisses at depth, based on interpretation of seismic-reflection data (Ivanic and Brett, 2015). However, younger granitic rocks are interpreted intrude a large portion of the basal contact of the complex.  There are many examples of younger rock units crosscutting parts of the Windimurra Igneous Complex. Big Bell Suite metagranitic rocks are in sheared contact around the northern end. Some of these shear zones are associated with 30 m-thick quartz veins, which are abundant along the northeastern contact. Metamonzogranites of the Tuckanarra Suite are in sheared contact with the upper zone along the Challa Shear Zone, which can be seen, on aeromagnetic images, to truncate many of the igneous layers. These layers are locally deformed into parallelism with shear zones and with foliation within the metamonzogranites. Walganna Suite granites intrude across the southern part, where they are interpreted to have cut across sheared layering within the southernmost part of the contiguous complex. Associated Li-rich pegmatites crosscut layers of the lower zone of the complex (e.g. TJIWIN090040, Zone 50, MGA 652854E 6843923N).  Proterozoic dykes and sills of the Warakurna Large Igneous Province cut across all parts of the complex. They are can be seen in seismic-reflection data (Ivanic et al., 2014b) and are particularly evident in the north and east (P_-od; P_-WK-od; P_-WK-gi).   ",,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,2813,,2813,,"Gabbroic rocks from the Windimurra Igneous Complex have yielded very few zircons. One late-stage pegmatitic gabbro in the middle zone has been directly dated at 2813 Â± 3 Ma (GSWA 194747, Wingate et al., 2012a). This is interpreted as the best estimate of the crystallization age of the complex. A grouping of only three zircons from the upper zone of the complex gave a date of 2802 Â± 19 Ma (GSWA 194749, Wingate et al., 2012b), which is within error of the interpreted crystallization age of the pegmatitic gabbro.   Rhyolite of the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member, which is interpreted as a roof pendant to the complex, has been dated at 2813 Â± 3 Ma (GSWA 169003, Nelson, 2001).   Felsic gneiss within the Challa Shear Zone has been dated at 2809 Â± 2 Ma (198210, Wingate et al. 2015) and is interpreted to be sheared rocks of the Mount Kenneth Suite. Parts of the Mount Kenneth Suite are contemporaneous with some components of the Windimurra and Narndee (A-ANna-xony-any) Igneous Complexes. A syn-deformational metamonzogranite of the Tuckanarra Suite within the Challa Shear Zone has been dated at 2668 Â± 8 Ma (Wang, 1998), which may be the age of the deformation.

The border zone is preserved only on the eastern side where it is sandwiched between the easternmost rocks of the lower zone and is in sheared contact with metasedimentary rocks, including banded iron-formation of the Norie Group. Around the rest of the complex, this marginal facies has been intruded or sheared out by granitic rocks. The border zone may represent the first phase of chilled primary magma of the Windimurra Igneous Complex.","The border zone of the Windimurra Igneous Complex forms a 45 km-long, discontinuous belt along the easternmost parts of the complex. It is that is rarely more than 100 m wide that outcrops mainly on the western part of WINDIMURRA. Small, discontinuous outcrops are found a few kilometres to the north on WOODLEY and to the south on YOUANMI. It is possible that some of the unassigned, dismembered units of the complex (A-ANwi-og and A-ANwi-mog) may have belonged to the border zone, in particular along the Wyemandoo Shear Zone on the southwesternmost part of WINDIMURRA.","The border zone of the Windimurra Igneous Complex is named according to its location at the margins of the Windimurra Igneous Complex in the side contacts. Previously these rocks have been called the 'Border Group' (Ahmat, 1986).   The type locality is at site TJIWIN000313 (Zone 50, MGA 653876E 6911966N) where amphibolitized metadolerite is in moderately sheared contact with metabanded iron-formation, metarhyolite, and metasiliciclastic rocks of the Norie Group and metagranite of the Jungar Suite. Here, it forms a layer that is parallel or very slightly discordant to igneous layering of the lower zone of the complex.",,"Metagabbro, dolerite, gabbro, and metadolerite are the dominant lithologies in the border zone. Texturally, the rocks are similar in all units, forming ophitic to subophitic rocks, where 2-5 mm plagioclase laths are partly enclosed by clinopyroxene. Minor oxide phases are also present. These rocks form a continuum from moderately fresh (i.e. minor chlorite present) to strongly metamorphosed to amphibolitic metagabbro to metadolerite, which is the dominant rock type adjacent to shear zones. In metamorphosed rocks, it is rare that relict igneous texture is completely obliterated.",,10,500,,"The border zone of the Windimurra Igneous Complex is in contact with the lower zone.

An intrusive relationship has not been observed between the two zones, but the geometry and aeromagnetic pattern indicates some subtle incursions of the lower zone into the border zone.  The border zone is oriented parallel to subparallel with layers of metasedimentary rocks assigned to the Norie Group, which surround the complex at its northern and eastern margins. It is possible that some of these metasedimentary rocks may have been exposed to contact metamorphism from intrusion of the border zone, but this is not clear mineralogically due to deformation and a low-grade metamorphic overprint.

It is composed of layered gabbroic rocks with a high proportion of gabbro, olivine gabbronorite and leucogabbro (A-ANwl-og, A-ANwl-ol, A-ANwl-ogl) and lesser amounts of ultramafic rocks (e.g. pyroxenite; A-ANwl-ax).

This zone contains many significant igneous features such as: a chromitite horizon (A-ANwl-ac), a  boulder anorthosite  unit (A-ANwl-xogd-oad), locally abundant pegmatitic horizons, and cross-bedded units. The lower zone in the western lobe of the complex forms a wedge-shaped outcrop, truncated to the north by the middle zone and to the south by granitic rocks of the Walgoo Monzogranite (A-BRwa-gm).   The lower zone of the Windimurra Igneous Complex is interpreted to have crystallized within uncertainty of a dated rock in the middle zone, at 2813 Â± 3 Ma.","The lower zone of the Windimurra Igneous Complex outcrops on WYNYANGOO, WOODLEY, CHALLA, WINDIMURRA, COOLAMANINU and YOUANMI. Its extent within the eastern lobe of the complex is 85 km north-south and 32 km east-west. The zone forms a large, part-oval, arcuate outcrop between the border zone at its outer contact (to the east) and the middle zone at its inner (western) contact. From seismic interpretation (Ivanic et al., 2014), this part of the lower zone likely extends all the way beneath the middle, upper and roof zones, and the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member (A-NOyk-xfr-cib) of the Yaloginda Formation (A-NOy-xf-cib), in a lopolithic form that is approximately 5.5 km thick.   The lower zone of the western lobe outcrops over an area of about 28 &times; 19 km and is bounded to the south by Walganna Suite monzogranite (e.g. A-BRwa-gm), to the east by the Shephards Discordant Zone (Ivanic et al., 2010), to the north by the middle zone of the western lobe, and to the west by sheared gabbroic rocks within the Challa Shear Zone. The lower zone of the western lobe, like the eastern lobe, has been modelled in 3D (Ivanic and Brett, 2015) to underlie the middle zone with a lopolithic overall geometry. The lower zone may have extended farther west but is truncated by units within the moderately east-dipping Challa Shear Zone.","The lower zone of the Windimurra Igneous Complex was named thus because of its position in the igneous stratigraphy; that is, above a postulated ultramafic zone and below the middle zone (Ivanic et al., 2010). The incoming of intercumulus magnetite defines the upper limit of the lower zone (i.e. the base of the middle zone) and, though unexposed, the incoming of cumulus plagioclase would define its basal contact with the ultramafic zone below. Previously, the majority of the units of the lower zone had been referred to as the 'Lower Zone' of the 'Windimurra Complex' (Ahmat, 1986) or the 'Lower Series' of the 'Windimurra Complex' (Mathison et al., 1991).  The type section for the lower zone is included in the formal lithostratigraphic narrative for its parent Windimurra Igneous Complex (A-ANwi-xony-am) in the Windimurra Hills area (Zone 50, MGA 653550E 6869000N). An additional section at the Mingyngura Hill area (Zone 50, MGA 633864E 6900708N) shows many exceptional features between sites TJIWIN000019 (Zone 50, MGA 608798E 6801288N) and TJIWIN090134 (Zone 50, MGA 633947E 6901099N). Here, a spectacular succession of olivine gabbronorite (A-ANwl-ol) is interleaved with layers of pegmatitic gabbro, which is locally rich in rounded pegmatitic anorthosite 'boulders' (A-ANwl-xogd-oad). There are also 10 m thick layers of clinopyroxenite (A-ANwl-axc) and lherzolite (A-ANwl-apl), associated with a thin chromitite horizon (A-ANwl-ac) which contains PGE sulfides (Van Kranendonk et al. 2010: Locality 3.3; Ivanic, 2016: Locality 4.1).",,"The lower zone of the eastern lobe of the Windimurra Igneous Complex contains approximately 5.5 km vertical thickness of igneous stratigraphy that, based on surface observations, totals nine kilometres of cumulative thickness. This succession was described in detail by Ahmat (1986) and comprises layered cycles of predominantly gabbroic lithologies, typically 25 m in vertical thickness, but varying from one centimetre to about 300 m. These features are also present in the lower zone of the western lobe of the complex, which hosts greater than two kilometres of igneous stratigraphy (Ivanic and Brett, 2015).   The majority of rock units belonging to the lower zone are stratiform layers, which are part of megacyclical layers (large-scale stratification up to 300 m vertical scale) in which more mafic lithologies show differentiation towards more felsic lithologies. These megacycles follow a general pattern from: 1) pyroxenitic to melanocratic olivine gabbronorite base; 2) gabbronorite; 3) leucogabbro to leucotroctolite; 4) leucogabbro to anorthosite. Many examples of stages 2 to 3 exist without 1 and 4.   At the scale of a typical exposure, cyclical modal layering is typically present within the decametre-scale layers of the megacycles. Variations in modal abundance of pyroxene and plagioclase account for most examples of this feature but olivine and chromite are involved locally. For example, within a gabbronorite unit (A-ANwl-om) that is about 30 m thick, there are typically orthopyroxenite-pyroxenite layers 1-5 cm thick, interlayered with leucogabbronorite and olivine gabbronorite. At a more local scale, one metre of exposure may contain tens of centimetre-thick layers (e.g. TJIWIN090407, Zone 50, MGA 653756E 6868900N).   Discordant features are present at all scales from decimetre-scale examples of cross-lamination and truncations to metre-scale excursions into basal layers. Deca- and hectometre-scale truncations are visible on air photographs and in aeromagnetic images. Additionally, there are isolated occurrences of pegmatitic gabbro, which are present as thick, lens-shaped regions and cross-cutting, irregular sheets. The pegmatitic gabbros are interpreted to be late-stage segregations of melt that crystallized in situ or were injected a small distance relative to neighbouring layers. They probably crystallized within the timeframe of crystallization of the complex as a whole.  Many exceptional igneous layering features of the lower zone can be found between sites TJIWIN000019 and TJIWIN090134 (see  Derivation of name  section above) including pegmatitic gabbro hosting anorthositic boulders and a clinopyroxenite-lherzolite succession that is associated with a centimetre-thick chromitite layer containing PGE (platinum group elements) sulfides at its base.  Rocks of the lower zone have cumulate textures, interpreted to have resulted from crystal accumulation in a magma chamber. There are many examples of orthocumulate, mesocumulate and adcumulate textures, which have been observed in the field (for crystal sizes 5-800 mm) and by microscopic investigations of thin sections. In contrast to the ultramafic lithologies, which typically consist of near monomineralic adcumulates of olivine or pyroxene crystals, the majority of gabbroic lithologies in the lower zone have orthocumulate textures. These rocks typically comprise chadacrysts of lath-shaped plagioclase 10 mm long, with oikocrysts of clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene 20-50 mm across. Where seen in contact, these oikocrysts form ~120&deg; triple junctions. There are many layers of rock within the lower zone that contain pyroxene oikocrysts with cores of altered olivine crystals. These rocks suggest a crystallization sequence of plagioclase-olivine-orthopyroxene-clinopyroxene. Mesocumulate textures are common in more-felsic rocks that have plagioclase cumulate crystals with interstitial pyroxene crystals.   Mineral zonation is rarely evident in orthocumulate rock textures under the microscope. However, plagioclase, and less commonly pyroxene, in meso- and adcumulate rocks typically have extinction patterns indicative of oscillatory zoning.  Ahmat (1986) analysed chemical variation of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase for the lower zone. From base to top, olivine compositions vary from approximately 75 to 64 (Fo mol%). The variation for orthopyroxene is 78 to 67 Mg#. The variation for clinopyroxene is 80 to 71 Mg#. The variation for plagioclase is 82 to 72 (An mol%). [Where: 'Fo' = forsterite mole proportion relative to fayalite; 'Mg#' = Mg/(Ca+Fe t ) cations; 'Fe t ' = Fe calculated as all FeO; 'An' = anorthite mole proportion relative to albite.]",,3000,6000,,"The lower zone of the Windimurra Igneous Complex is typically in sheared contact with Norie Group metasedimentary country rocks (e.g. at TJIWIN090606, Zone 50, MGA 654943 6909358N and TJIWIN000310, Zone 50, MGA 653652E 6912546N). Along this contact, there are local outcrops of dolerite of the border zone, likely remnants of the first phase of intrusion of the complex, that are onlapped by gabbroic layers of the lower zone (e.g. at TJIWIN090606).   Overlying the lower zone of eastern and western lobes of the Windimurra Igneous Complex are layered gabbroic rocks of the middle zone. This contact can be traced between TJIWIN000103 (Zone 50, MGA 646186E 6860173N) and TJIWIN000104 (Zone 50, MGA 646017E 6860402N), and also between TJIWIN000071 (Zone 50, MGA 652856E 6869517N) and TJIWIN000955 (Zone 50, MGA 652621E 6869621N). This relationship is a low-angle igneous unconformity (varying to conformable) where the middle zone cumulates eroded into the underlying stratigraphy of the lower zone. The lower zone is also in contact with the complex's roof zone rocks. Although this latter contact is not exposed, it is apparent from aeromagnetic and seismic data that gabbroic plutons of the roof zone cut across layering in the lower zone (Ivanic and Brett, 2015).  To the west, the Challa Shear Zone (Ivanic and Brett, 2015) juxtaposes ultramafic zone rocks and unassigned Windimurra Igneous Complex units against the lower zone. To the southeast, the Wyemandoo Shear Zone (Ivanic and Brett, 2015) juxtaposes Norie Group metasedimentary rocks against the lower zone. Northerly trending, steeply dipping normal faults offset and juxtapose rocks of the lower zone against middle and upper zones in the central part of the complex. Similarly, a few northeasterly trending brittle faults offset rocks of this zone.  The lower zone is also distinctly crosscut by Tuckanarra Suite (e.g. at site TJIWIN000275, Zone 50, MGA 635417E 6909998N) and Walganna Suite (e.g. at sites TJIWIN090042, Zone 50, MGA 653392E 6844384N and TJIWIN090043, Zone 50, MGA 653521E 6844437N) granitic rocks in several locations.

It overlies, and locally intrudes, the lower zone in the eastern lobe of the complex; and also intrudes the basal part of the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member of the Yaloginda Formation, and tonalitic plutons of the Mount Kenneth Suite. It is not part of the  layered series  of the complex and has not been directly dated. The roof zone comprises multiple plutons &mdash; each probably several kilometres in diameter &mdash; of porphyritic gabbro, dolerite and porphyritic dolerite. These lithologies grade into each other locally. The overall form of the roof zone appears to be a sill-like to slightly lopolithic, and broadly synformal underneath the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member (Ivanic and Brett, 2015). This zone is thought to represent contact between the final phases of intrusion of the Windimurra Igneous Complex and the roof pendants at the highest structural level of the complex. Its porphyritic nature and xenolith content indicate that it has passed through the cumulate pile beneath, and its relatively fine grain size implies relatively rapid cooling as the unit chilled against overlying country rocks. Local spinifex texture also indicates rapid cooling.","The roof zone is located in the central northern part of the Windimurra Igneous Complex, mainly on northeastern CHALLA. It mantles exposures of the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member of the Yaloginda Formation (A-NOyk-xfr-cib), and is surrounded mainly by rocks of the lower zone of the eastern lobe of the complex. These exposures are located around Kantie Murdana Hill (Zone 50, MGA 644976E 6889454N), Mount Ford (Zone 50, MGA 646883E 6899635N), Mount Magnet (Zone 50, MGA 641570E 6885639N) and Nulercamya Hill (Zone 50, MGA 647603E 6906107N). The unit trends northeast and is interpreted to be about 35.6 long and up to 12.7 km across. Although porphyritic plutons within this unit (e.g. A-ANwr-ogp) are dominantly flatlying, apophyses extend upwards into the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member (e.g. TJIWIN090408, Zone 50, MGA 646486E 6893080N). According to seismic data, the roof zone is approximately 0.3 km thick and may extend to depths of approximately one kilometre below the surface (Ivanic and Brett, 2015).","The roof zone is so named because it occurs at the highest structural level of the Windimurra Igneous Complex, in contact with roof pendants (Ivanic et al., 2010). Previously, these rocks were 'unassigned gabbroids' of Ahmat (1986). At the type locality (TJIWIN090408, Zone 50, MGA 646486E 6893080N), an apophysis of porphyritic gabbro intrudes overlying metarhyolitic rocks of the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member. There are many other localities showing intrusive relations (e.g. TJIWIN090423, Zone 50, MGA 644787E 6885905N, which shows chilled spinifex-textured quartz gabbro in contact with metarhyolitic rocks). At TJIWIN100004 (Zone 50, MGA 638663E 6887497N), anorthositic xenoliths can be seen within plagioclase-phyric gabbro.

Although there is no comprehensive geochemical dataset for the roof zone, the rocks appear to have a tholeiitic affinity and are basaltic in composition. Quartz-bearing gabbroic lithologies in this zone are indicative of a moderately evolved tholeiitic fractionation trend and have Zr contents greater than 300 ppm (e.g. 498 ppm in GSWA 193983, which is a dolerite collected at TJIWIN090416, Zone 50, MGA 646125E 6887160N).

93,74660,P_-_wm-mh,1,Wirku Metamorphics,1,Undivided weakly to strongly banded gneiss; typically quartzofeldspathic but includes amphibolitic rocks; mostly derived from sedimentary or volcano-sedimentary protoliths,"Apart from rare and isolated outcrops of c. 1400 Ma orthogneiss, the rocks of the Wirku Metamorphics (including the former, now obsolete, Pity Palya Metamorphics) form the oldest exposed basement units of the west Musgrave Province. They outcrop in the Latitude Hills area of BELL ROCK (Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone), and also in southwest BLACKSTONE (Mamutjarra Zone) where they are engulfed by coeval intrusions of the Wankanki Supersuite. They are sporadically distributed throughout the central part of the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone (on HOLT, northeastern BLACKSTONE, and northern BELL ROCK) and the northern parts of the Walpa Pulka Zone (BATES), as metre- to kilometre-scale inclusions within younger igneous rocks. The Wirku Metamorphics have undergone at least two phases of granulite-facies metamorphism (the latter was at ultrahigh temperature) during the Mount West and Musgrave Orogenies, and as a result, these rocks are now strongly deformed composite gneisses with granoblastic textures. The unit is a supracrustal package of psammites, arkosic metasandstones, pelites, and lesser volcaniclastic and volcanic rocks, deposited from c. 1340 Ma to potentially as late as 1270 Ma. It is possible that the volcanic equivalents of the Wankanki Supersuite and Wirku Metamorphics together formed a continental arc and basin.","Rocks of the Wirku Metamorphics are sporadically distributed throughout the west Musgrave Province, within the central Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone (on HOLT, northeastern BLACKSTONE, and northern BELL ROCK), northern Walpa Pulka Zone (BATES), and underlying a contiguous 200 km 2  area in the Mamutjarra Zone (southwest BLACKSTONE). In these zones, they form metre- to kilometre-scale inclusions in younger igneous rocks of the Pitjantjatjara and Wankanki Supersuites. In the southern half of BLACKSTONE, kilometre-scale xenoliths of Wirku Metamorphics within granites of the Wankanki Supersuite occur over an area of roughly 1000 km 2 , but are typically poorly exposed relative to the host granites, forming only 30% of the already sparse exposure in the area. In the Latitude Hills area of southeast BELL ROCK, these rocks underlie a 63 km 2  area dominated by outcrops of pelite.  Rocks of the Wirku Metamorphics are best exposed as kilometre-scale, low strain, supracrustal  rafts  (from northwest to southeast: at Mount Holt, Mount Aloysius, and Mount West) within the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone, where they comprise ~7% of the surface geology. Culturally sensitive areas tend to coincide with outcrop of these rafts and access is generally limited. The Wirku Metamorphics are poorly exposed (<10% of exposed rock) in the Walpa Pulka Zone, and the mapped distribution in this area, covering roughly 25% of the Walpa Pulka Zone, is mostly based on geophysical interpretation.","The unit name is derived from the local Aboriginal name for a series of small hills (Wirku Wirku) approximately 5 km to the northeast of Mount Fanny, in central eastern BATES.",,"The Wirku Metamorphics is a supracrustal package of psammites, arkosic metasandstones, pelites, and lesser metavolcaniclastic and metavolcanic rocks; rare calc-silicate layers may also be present. The paragneisses of the Wirku Metamorphics can be broadly divided into the following main lithological units: garnet-hercynite-sillimanite-cordierite pelites; garnet-sillimanite-orthopyroxene pelites; orthopyroxene(-garnet) psammites; garnet-bearing leucosomes; and arkosic metasandstones. A substantial portion of the Wirku Metamorphics is also composed of orthopyroxene-plagioclase(-quartz) gneisses, and granitic gneisses of probable igneous (volcanic) origin that interleaved with the metasediments. Arkosic metasandstones and orthopyroxene-plagioclase(-quartz) gneisses occur as metre- to kilometre-thick layers in the Mount Holt and Mount Aloysius regions (referred to here as the  Mount Holt and Mount Aloysius supracrustal rafts ) of the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone, and also as metre-scale inclusions in the Walpa Pulka Zone. These psammitic units make up most of the Wirku Metamorphics. Garnet-sillimanite-orthopyroxene pelites are the most abundant pelitic units in the Walpa Pulka Zone and Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone, whereas garnet-hercynite-sillimanite-cordierite pelites only form rare metre-scale layers in these areas. All of the units listed above are gneissic, recrystallized, and variably migmatized.  The Wirku Metamorphics have undergone at least two phases of granulite-facies metamorphism during the Mount West and Musgrave Orogenies. Dating of metamorphic zircon rims accompanying garnet-orthopyroxene(-sillimanite-hercynite-cordierite-quartz) assemblages indicate that the supracrustal package underwent ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism during the Musgrave Orogeny.","Based on granite geochemistry (Smithies et al., 2010), it can be speculated that the volcanic equivalents of the Wankanki Supersuite and the Wirku Metamorphics formed together in a continental arc and basin between c. 1345 and c. 1300 Ma. The dominance of relatively proximal-setting metasedimentary (psammites) and volcanic protoliths to these gneisses imply that the basin was never wide enough to form abyssal plains (Smithies et al., 2009; Evins et al., 2012).",2000,,,,,17,,,,4,,,,1340,,1270,,"Sixteen samples from the Wirku Metamorphics have been dated by ion microprobe (SHRIMP). Using these samples, an approximate maximum depositional age can be interpreted from an average of the youngest detrital zircon components (c. 1340 Ma; Evins et al., 2012). The minimum depositional age is constrained by crosscutting c. 1300 Ma granites of the Wankanki Supersuite in the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone, and a 1319 Â± 7 Ma felsic volcanic layer that is interleaved with metasedimentary units of the Wirku Metamorphics south of Mount Holt (GSWA 180867, Kirkland et al., 2009a). Together, these ages suggest that protoliths to the Wirku Metamorphics were, in most cases, deposited between 1340 and 1300 Ma. However, some exposures are of paragneisses containing detrital zircon grains with cores apparently as young as c. 1270 Ma. For example, sample GSWA 187115, a medium-grained acid to intermediate granulite gneiss unit (P_-_wm-mroi) from the eastern flank of Mount Aloysius (BELL ROCK), contains zircon cores with a 1555-1270 Ma age range, and significant c. 1510, 1410, and 1360 Ma detrital populations (Kirkland et al., 2009b); Evins et al. (2012) suggests that c. 1270 Ma is the best estimate for the depositional age of the protolith to this gneiss. However, there is significant difficulty in determining the maximum depositional age for these rocks, as radiogenic-Pb loss was pervasive during the Musgrave Orogeny. Nonetheless, it is possible that the Wirku Metamorphics might include a younger sedimentary unit in the Tjuni Purlka Tectonic Zone.  Two samples, interpreted to be volcaniclastic rocks, have zircon grains sourced solely from the Wankanki Supersuite, and yielded unimodal zircon populations of 1310 Â± 7 and 1334 Â± 6 Ma (GSWA 184150, Kirkland et al., 2011a; GSWA 190245, Kirkland et al., 2011b); these rocks are tentatively assigned to the Wirku Metamorphics. In the southwest BLACKSTONE region, the minimum depositional age of the Wirku Metamorphics is also constrained by a crosscutting 1321 Â± 5 Ma granite of the Wankanki Supersuite (GSWA 184158, Kirkland et al., 2012).

The extent of the exposures suggests the stratigraphic section is at least several hundred metres thick, possibly as much as 2700 m (Gravestock et al., 1995). No actual exposures are known in Western Australia - just an area of prominent photolineaments interpreted by Jackson and van de Graaff (1981) as bedding, and underlain by calcrete ridges. Bedding trends indicate gentle folding, probably during the Late Cambrian Delamarian Orogeny. The name remains informal because of the lack of knowledge of the Wirrildar 'beds'.

2257,20327,A-HAd-kd,4129,Wittenoom Formation,1,"Thinly bedded dolomite and dolomitic shale, with minor black chert, shale, banded iron formation and sandstone","The Wittenoom Formation records the slope-to-basin facies transition of an extensive carbonate platform developed on the southern Pilbara Craton between c. 2596 and 2504 Ma. The shelf slope break associated with this platform was located to the north of the Fortescue Valley. The formation is thickest along the Fortescue Valley, where it is largely concealed and estimated to be about 1400 m thick, thinning towards the south and southwest. The Wittenoom Formation consists of the shale-dominated West Angela Member at the base that is conformably overlain by dolomite with minor shale, banded iron-formation (BIF) and chert of the Paraburdoo Member that is in turn conformably overlain by the more heterolithic Bee Gorge Member that is dominated by argillite with lesser carbonate, chert and BIF. There are two impact spherule layers within the Wittenoom Formation in the Paraburdoo and Bee Gorge Members that are useful for regional and global stratigraphic correlation.","The Wittenoom Formation is present throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region on the YARRALOOLA, PYRAMID, WYLOO, MOUNT BRUCE, ROY HILL, BALFOUR DOWNS, TUREE CREEK, NEWMAN, and ROBERTSON 1:250 000 map sheets. Trendall et al. (2004) quote an average thickness of 520 m, although in reality the thickness of the Wittenoom Formation is highly variable, both in terms of its overall thickness as well as the thickness of constituent members (e.g. Simonson et al., 1993a). The formation reaches a maximum thickness well in excess of 692 m in drill holes in the Fortescue Valley (e.g. WRL 1, FVG 1) that only penetrate the lower two members. South of the Fortescue Valley, outcrop widths suggest a marked thinning towards the south and southwest, and the Wittenoom Formation has been locally removed by faulting on the northern limb of the Hardey Syncline, the western side of the Turee Creek Syncline, and within parts of the Turner Syncline. Thickness variations within the Wittenoom Formation may also be partly due to subsurface dissolution related to the formation of iron-ore deposits (Morris, 1985; Simonson et al., 1993a; Taylor et al., 2001).","The Wittenoom Formation was originally defined as the Wittenoom Dolomite by MacLeod et al. (1963). Trendall and Blockley (1970) recognized an informal two-fold subdivision consisting of a lower part dominated by dolomite with minor shale, BIF and chert, and a more heterolithic upper part dominated by argillite with lesser carbonate, chert, and BIF. Simonson et al. (1993a) proposed the name change because of the unit not consisting exclusively of dolomite. The name is derived from the former town site of Wittenoom and the type area is in the hills to the south (Zone 50, MGA 637400E 7538898N), although only the very uppermost part of the formation is exposed here. No complete type section has been proposed for the Wittenoom Formation, although type sections do exist for the constituent members. Following the recognition and definition of the basal West Angela Member by Blockley et al. (1993), Simonson et al. (1993a) revised the definition of the formation, recognizing two additional subdivisions above the West Angela Member; viz. the Paraburdoo and overlying Bee Gorge Members.",,"The Wittenoom Formation is one of the most heterolithic formations in the Hamersley Group (Simonson et al., 1993a). The basal West Angela Member is generally not well exposed, and consists predominantly of dolomite and shaly dolomite, with minor limestone, chert, BIF, volcaniclastic rocks, and impact ejecta layers. Near the base, there is a distinctive unit of interbedded chert, BIF, and shale with characteristic natural gamma-ray peaks that are designated AS1 to AS3 (Blockley et al., 1993). The overlying Paraburdoo Member consists predominantly of planar-laminated dololutites with microbial lamination and roll-up structures, rare dolarenites (turbidites) that were dispersed towards the south and west, minor chert, and planar-laminated argillite. The uppermost Bee Gorge Member is more heterolithic and is composed predominantly of argillite with lesser amounts of carbonate, chert, and BIF. Four informal marker horizons are recognized within the Wittenoom Formation and can be correlated throughout large parts of the Hamersley Basin. In stratigraphic order, these are the Paraburdoo Spherule Layer in the Paraburdoo Member (Hassler et al., 2011), the Crystal rich tuff, Main tuff interval, and Spherule marker bed in the Bee Gorge Member (Simonson, 1992; Hassler, 1991; Hassler, 1993; Simonson and Hassler 1997).","There are no indicators of deposition above storm wave base within the Wittenoom Formation, such as stromatolites, oncolites, or edgewise intraclast breccias, and consequently it is interpreted to have been deposited in a deep-water environment in front of a carbonate platform (Simonson et al., 1993b) that is preserved in the partly coeval Carawine Dolomite (Rasmussen et al., 2005). However, actual water depths are difficult to determine, but are interpreted to have been in the order of several hundred metres on average (Simonson et al., 1993b). Deposition is interpreted to have taken place in a predominantly pelagic environment, with rare catastrophic slope collapse and associated gravity-induced sedimentation. The presence of sediment-binding microbial mats further indicates that the depositional environment was dysaerobic to aerobic. Thickness, paleocurrent directions, and grain-size trends in the carbonate turbidites indicate a broadly southwesterly paleoslope (Simonson et al., 1993b). The location of the shelf slope break is difficult to place, but is interpreted to have been north of the Fortescue Valley during deposition of the Wittenoom Formation.",,1400,,"The basal contact of the West Angela Member is marked by a sharp contact between shale or shaly dolomite and a thick unit of podded magnetite-bearing BIF at the top of the underlying Mount Newman Member of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation (Blockley et al., 1993). The Wittenoom Formation is conformably overlain by the Mount Sylvia Formation, with the contact marked by a sharp change from shale and dolomitic shale to the lowermost BIF of the Mount Sylvia Formation (Trendall and Blockley, 1970).",,17,,,,4,,,,2596,,2504,,"The maximum age of the Wittenoom Formation is constrained by the 2597 Â± 5 Ma age of the NS3 shale macroband in the underlying Mount Newman Member of the Marra Mamba Iron Formation (Trendall et al., 1998), and the minimum age by a 2504 Â± 5 Ma tuff bed in the overlying Mount McRae Shale (Rasmussen et al., 2005). The only depositional age constraints from within the Wittenoom Formation are for the Crystal rich tuff at 2561 Â± 8 Ma (Trendall et al., 1998) and the Spherule marker bed at 2565 Â± 9 Ma (Trendall et al., 2004).

This suite is dominantly large plutons of coarse-grained, equigranular, muscovite-bearing alkali granite with accessory fluorite common. The suite also comprises coarsely K-feldspar-porphyritic alkali granite plutons and numerous pegmatites which are commonly enriched in Li, Be, F, Sn and Ta and are the focus of several mining projects in the Murchison Mineral Field. The suite is co-eval with and probably outlasts the extremely voluminous Walganna Suite monzogranites.","The suite is adjacent to vast plutons of the Walganna Suite to the west and forms distinct plutons 5-20 km in diameter. These plutons occur over the entire areal extent of the Murchison Domain and most commonly occur adjacent to Jungar and Walganna Suite granites. Wogala Suite pegmatites are locally abundant in greenstone lithologies adjacent to Walganna and Wogala Suite granites. For example, there is a pegmatite swarm in the southeastern part of the Windimurra Igneous Complex on YOUANMI with an areal extent of 10 x 10 km.","The Wogala Suite (Van Kranendonk and Ivanic, 2009) is named after Wogala Bore (Zone 50 MGA 595000E 7044000N). Wogala Bore is located on outcrop of the Marlomumbah Granite on the MADOONGA 1:100 000 mapsheet. Previously some of the plutons from this suite had been classified as part of the &quot;Low-Ca&quot; granite suite (Champion and Cassidy, 2002).  The type locality for the Wogala Suite is in the Marlomumbah Granite at its geochronology sample site (MTWMAD000101, Zone 50, MGA 596917E 7046690N), which exposed a relatively homogeneous and fresh fluorite-bearing alkali granite. This pluton crosscuts the tonalitic rocks of the Culculli Suite 500 m to the east.",,"The Wogala Suite comprises several lithologies that represent highly fractionated granitic compositions. Plutons are typically alkali granites with variable abundances of muscovite, biotite and fluorite. Textures are typically equigranular with a grain size of 2-8 mm. However, exposures of K-feldspar porphyritic textures with K-feldspars up to 20 mm are also recorded. The granites of the Wogala Suite lack penetrative solid-state deformation, but contains regions with a strong magmatic fabric, especially close to the edges of plutons.  Minor chlorite (typically found at the rims of biotite grains) is present as a metamorphic phase, indicating a greenschist facies metamorphic overprint. Pegmatite veins of the Wogala Suite may be locally rich in muscovite, biotite, chlorite, fluorite, lepidolite, polylithionite, beryl and other LILE-rich phases. These veins metasomatise host rocks causing 'granitisation' textures.  The highly evolved character of the suite involves HREE enrichment (birdwing REE patterns) and it is the most fractionated suite of the Youanmi Terrane and possibly of the whole Yilgarn Craton (Ivanic et al., 2012).",,,,,Plutons of this suite crosscut plutons of the Cullculli and Jungar suites.

Stromatolites up to 5 m high are present in the northern part of the outcrop belt, indicating water depths of at least 5 m, which shallowed progressively southwards to intermittent emergence south of the present basin axis. In common with the rest of the Earaheedy Basin succession, the Wongawol Formation is progressively more deformed northwards due to north-south compression, with a pattern of sheared out anticlional and synclinal axes between relatively straight, steeply dipping fold limbs south of the Lee Steere Range. There are no internal age constraints on the age of the Wongawol Formation - from detrital zircon data, the Chiall Formation below is probably younger than 1876 Ma, and the Mulgarra Sandstone is probably younger than about 1810 Ma. The vailidity of this analytical data has, however, recently been doubted.","The Wongawol Formation is exposed along the central axis of the Earaheedy Basin on EARAHEEDY, WONGAWOL, LEE STEERE, WINDIDDA, COONABILDIE and CARNEGIE, overlain to the east by the Kulele Limestone and Mulgarra Sandstone on COONABILDIE and CARNEGIE, and by Kulele Limestone in a small synclinal dish on southwest LEE STEERE. No stratigraphic sections were measured in the latest phase of mapping (Jones, 2002; Hocking and Pirajno, 2004; Adamides et al., 2000), and thickness estimates are complicated by shallow dips, mesoscale folding and local faulting. Nonetheless, Bunting (1986) estimated the Wongawol Formation is about 1500 m thick. Deformation of the formation increases northwards, north of the basin axis.","The Wongawol Formation ( P_EMo-sf ) was named by Hall et al. (1977) and described in detail first by Hall and Goode (1978) and later by Bunting (1986), and is shown on previous maps as  P_Eo  or (on LEE STEERE)  P_Eo-sf . It is named after Wongawol homestead, and the type section lies along the Wiluna - Carnegie road from 1 km south of Wongawol homestead to 1 km east southeast of Thurraguddy Bore. This section is poorly exposed, but a complete stratigraphic section. Better exposures lie north of the road, but are not well constrained stratigraphically.  The lower contact with the Chiall Formation is placed at the top of the uppermost compositionally mature sandstone. The upper contact with the Kulele Limestone, where exposed, is transitional and placed where limestone becomes the dominant lithology (Bunting, 1986). ",,"The Wongawol Formation is a succession of mudstone, siltstone, very fine-grained feldspathic sandstone, and minor intraclast conglomerate, in places calcareous. Sandstone in the Wongawol Formation is dominantly very fine grained, in places silicified, and locally glauconitic. Locally, sandstone contains mudchip and well-rounded siltstone intraclasts, with  in situ  brecciation of thin siltstone beds. Ball and pillow structures and horizon-constrained contorted bedding are widespread.  Carbonate intervals increase in abundance higher in the formation. They are commonly 2-3 m thick, parallel to wavy-laminated, and consist of thinner beds around 10-30 cm thick interbedded with fine-grained sandstone. Peloidal horizons associated with the carbonates contain peloids of carbonate, glauconite, recrystallized chert, ferruginous chert, and iron oxides, in a fine-grained matrix that originally may have been carbonate. Chert beds, peloids of chert and ferruginous chert, and intraclasts of chert suggest brecciation and reworking of chemically precipitated sediments prior to lithification, and a similar depositional setting to that of the granular iron-formation in the Frere Formation, which contains similar intraclastic breccias.  Stromatolites in carbonate rocks are present in several horizons, more commonly in the upper Wongawol Formation, where Hall and Goode (1978) and Bunting (1986) recognized a distinct member, the Sholl Creek Member. This member was not differentiated in the latest phase of mapping. At a locality 2.5 km northeast of Thurraguddy Bore (LEE STEERE, 403880E 7134320N), there are examples which are domal, 50 cm wide , 1 m long, and 40 to 60 cm high that show a wave translation direction of 250&ordm;. Smaller parasitic domal forms encrust larger domes, and the stromatolites are associated with mudchip intraclast breccias and oolitic limestones. Compound domal forms up to about 3 m high and 4 m across are present 3.5 km west of Kipillon Spring (LEE STEERE 434500E 7151050N), but wave translation directions could not be determined.  Discontinuous conglomerate bodies are notable on WONGAWOL and southern LEE STEERE. Clasts are typically well-rounded, matrix-supported, pebble-sized, and mostly composed of mudstone and carbonate. Both mudstone and carbonate clasts are interpreted as intraclastic. Intraclast mud-chip conglomerates are well-exposed on LEE STEERE in a small hillock immediately south of the Wongawol - Carnegie Road east of Mingol Pool at 430720E 7134540N. In this area, they are associated with small-to medium-scale pillow structures, possibly developed by sediment loading. Thin beds of intraclastic breccia, largely derived from adjacent cherty layers, are present 2.3 km south of Max Bore (EARAHEEDY, MGA 369900E 7135700N). On WONGAWOL, volcaniclastic clasts with vitriclastic textures were recorded by Jones (2004). The clasts contain well-preserved relic glass shards that are uncompacted and show bubble-wall, triple point textures. The matrix consists of poorly sorted, angular to subangular clasts of quartz, feldspar, and biotite, which are dominantly silt to very fine-grained sand, in a micritic cement. The provenance of the clasts is unclear as there is little evidence of contemporaneous volcanism in the Earaheedy Basin - they may be from reworking of thin volcaniclastic beds, which have not been preserved, or they may be allochthonous.   Sedimentary structures in the Wongawol Formation on WONGAWOL and southern and central LEE STEERE include swash marks, ripple washouts, wrinkle marks, ball-and-pillow structures (mostly but not always at sandstone-siltstone interfaces), primary current lineation, and symmetrical and interference ripples. Symmetrical ripples typically have peaked crests and are straight-crested, with wavelengths of 8-10 cm and amplitudes around 2-3 cm. Weakly developed ladder ripples are locally present in the troughs of some symmetrical ripples. These are indicative of deposition in shallow water with intermittent emergence and reworking by swash and possibly wind. Ball-and-pillow structures formed either by loading or as a result of earthquake shock. An extensive horizon of contorted bedding, primarily pillow structures, is exposed about 1 km west of Mobadoo Bore, on the west bank of a creek immediately south of the Wongawol - Carnegie road (LEE STEERE 419450E 7134500N). Here, layer-constrained contortion of thinly bedded rippled siltstone to very fine-grained sandstone has taken place above an uncontorted interference-rippled siltstone. The ripple morphology indicates very shallow conditions, while the contortion shows no consistent orientation, suggestive of earthquake disturbance rather than slope collapse. The lithology of the contorted material is quite similar to the clasts of the mud-chip conglomerates, suggesting the conglomerates may be event-generated rather than simple reworking.    On LEE STEERE north of the basin axis, the Wongawol Formation is folded into multiple east-trending anticlines and synclines, and cut by an network of anastomosing east-trending faults, indicative of mild north-south compression. The intensity of the folding increases northwards, into a pattern (low in the Wongawol Formation and in the Princes Ranges Member) of sheared-out anticlinal and synclinal axes between relatively straight, moderately to steeply dipping fold limbs. ","The Wongawol Formation was deposited in shallow water on a broad, north-deepening ramp, based on the widespread sediment loading (ball and pillow structures), ripple morphology (including ladder ripples, small interference ripples, and ripple washouts), swash marks, mudchip breccias, and runzel-marked surfaces. There was intermittent emergence, and tectonic disturbance (earthquakes) was common during deposition, based on the widespread horizons of contorted bedding and abundant ball and pillow loading structures. 3-6 cm with a height around 0.2 - 0.5 cm. Climbing (in-phase) ripple marks indicate periods of high sediment supply. Stromatolite horizons probably formed in saline coastal lagoons and inlets, with tidal flow and wave orientation responsible for elongate stromatolite morphology. North of Thurraguddy Bore, this was about 250 0 , rather than north-south. Larger forms further north (west of Kipillon Spring on LEE STEERE) indicate water depths increased northwards, to at least 3 to 5 m. Locally in central LEE STEERE, asymmetric ripples show a clear bipolar pattern indicative of tidal conditions.",1000,1500,,"The Wongawol Formation is conformable on the Princess Ranges member of the Chiall Formation, and is conformably overlain by the Kulele Formation. Both boundaries are gradational. The lower boundary is the uppermost quartz arenite of the Chiall Formation, the upper boundary is placed at the first laterally continuous limestone bed.

(written comm.) doubted the validity of the analytical data, and Matonia (2009) later recovered no zircons younger than 2050 Ma from two samples of Chiall Formation, and 1971 Ma from the underlying Yelma Formation.  A minimum age is provided by the age of metamorphic mica in deformed Tooloo Group (Pirajno et al., 2009). Sheppard et al. (written comm.) also suggested that the ages of 1815 Ma for authigenic monazite in the Yelma Formation (Muhling et al., 2012) could be related to deformation of the Earaheedy Basin as a whole, rather than to mineralization of the Yelma Formation, and that therefore all of the Tooloo and Miningarra Groups might be older than 1815 Ma and predate the Capricorn Orogeny (1820 - 1770 Ma).",No,,,3,,No,DE in Progress,No,Yes,P_,EMo,,,,,MIGSDRH,2.02E+13,,No,No

The term 'Woodlands Member' is preferred here because the unit also locally contains a significant proportion of siltstone and minor pebbly sandstone and conglomerate. In addition, the term 'arenite' is somewhat misleading as some of the sandstones contain a high proportion of mud matrix and hence should be more suitably classified as wackes.",,"The Woodlands Member generally consists of medium- to very coarse-grained quartz sandstone, interbedded with lesser amounts of siltstone and minor pebbly sandstone and conglomerate. Many of the sandstones contain abundant secondary magnetite and evidence of chlorite, silica, and manganese alteration is also often widespread throughout the unit.  Coarse- to very coarse-grained sandstones and pebbly sandstones are mostly thickly to very thickly bedded and have an internal structure that is either massive, or else shows parallel stratification or medium- to large-scale cross-stratification. Sparse paleocurrent data from trough cross-stratified sandstone beds indicate that sediment transport was directed towards the west. Beds of fine- to medium-grained sandstone and siltstone, that are locally deposited between the thicker bedded sandstones, are either parallel-planar laminated or ripple cross-laminated. Intercalated conglomerates are lenticular bedded, massive to scoured, and composed mostly of granules and pebbles of vein quartz.  Vogt (1995) describes the Woodlands Member as a coarse-grained, rounded, moderately sorted quartz sandstone, with the quartz grains showing wide rims of secondary quartz. The interstices are occupied by secondary quartz and ferroan dolomite. The latter contains abundant anhedral to subhedral opaque minerals (mainly magnetite) and also anhedral barite grains in places.

4716,20522,J-_wd-slh,1,Woodleigh Formation,1,"Finely laminated carbonaceous siltstone and mudstone, interbedded with fine-grained silty sandstone; pyritic, with common woody material and local slumping textures (subsurface only)","The Woodleigh Formation consists of weakly indurated, pyritic, interbedded carbonaceous shale and sandstone, interpreted as lacustrine crater fill within the Woodleigh impact structure. The unit is only recorded in a small area within the Gascoyne Platform near Woodleigh Station (northern YARINGA and southern WOORAMEL 1:250 000 map sheets). Although the full geographic extent is presently unknown, it appears to be restricted to a ring syncline extending up to 25 km from the centre of the impact structure. The Woodleigh Formation is everywhere unconformably overlain by a thick package of flat-lying Cretaceous (Winning Group) and younger sedimentary units. As a result, the unit is only known from a small number of water and mineral bores, with the best intersections in Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) Woodleigh 2A and Carpentaria CB4 bore holes. Few of these bore intersections reached the bottom of the formation, although the unit probably rests unconformably throughout its extent on Silurian to Devonian units, particularly the Dirk Hartog Group.  Based on the section preserved in GSWA Woodleigh 2A (Mory et al., 2001), the unit is dominated by finely laminated mudstone and silty sandstones forming fining upwards cycles. The unit shows increasing proportions of shale to sandstone, and increasing amounts of woody and lignitic material up-section. The palynology assemblages obtained to date are assignable to the Callialasporites turbatus and possibly the Corollina torosa Spore-Pollen Zones of Helby et al. (1987), and therefore indicate an Early Jurassic age for the unit. The Woodleigh Formation also provides a minimum age constraint for the age of the Woodleigh impact. The only fossils recorded from this formation are woody material and non-marine palynomorphs.","The Woodleigh Formation is restricted to the subsurface within the Woodleigh impact structure, southern Gascoyne Platform (northern 1:250 000 map sheet YARINGA and southern 1:250 000 map sheet WOORAMEL). The unit forms the main part of the sedimentary fill for this impact crater, and appears restricted to the central part of the Woodleigh structure, specifically within an interpreted ring syncline up to 25 km from the structure s centre (Iasky et al., 2001, fig. 7). As such, the unit s depositional distribution was likely to be constrained by the extent of the impact crater.  There are no known exposures of the Woodleigh Formation within the Southern Carnarvon Basin. Although the full subsurface extent is currently uncertain, it has been noted to closely match the extent of the Woodleigh impact feature in seismic data (Iasky et al., 2001; Carr et al., 2012).The farthest known record of the Woodleigh Formation from the centre of the impact structure is in water bore Woodleigh no. 9, 25 km to the east-southeast, with a possible record (presently untested due to a lack of available samples) 30 km to the southeast (Swan Resources Woodleigh (WB) 1982/1; Layton and Associates Pty Ltd, 1982). Aside from the boreholes mentioned above, a small number of other mineral and water exploration bores in the Woodleigh area are also considered to have intersected the Woodleigh Formation, specifically GSWA Woodleigh 2A, Carpentaria CB4, and Woodleigh no. 1, 2, 4A, 7, 9, and 10 water bores (Iasky et al., 2001, Appendix 1; refer to this appendix for location information for all holes intersecting the Woodleigh Formation). Water bores Woodleigh 3, 5, and 6, Yaringa 18, and Medo 3 and mineral exploration bores Carpentaria CB2 and CB3, also potentially intersected Jurassic sediments, although this cannot be proven at present. The Woodleigh Formation is conspicuously absent from GSWA Woodleigh 1 and Woodleigh 1981/2, both of which lie within the central uplift zone close to the structure's centre, and Yaringa 1, which is roughly 30 km west of the impact centre and therefore outside the ring syncline (Iasky et al., 2001).  The thinnest recorded intersection of the Woodleigh Formation is 15 m thick and situated in water bore Woodleigh 1, with only 25 m of this unit intersected within the type section (210-235 m depth in water bore Woodleigh no. 7). However, neither borehole reached the bottom of the Woodleigh Formation. The Woodleigh Formation has a maximum known thickness of 298 m in GSWA Woodleigh 2A. However, apatite fission track data from this well suggested an uplift of around 700 m, indicating an original formation thickness of 1100 m at this location (Mory et al., 2001). The uppermost part of the formation is considered to have been removed during continental break-up from India, prior to the deposition of the Winning Group (Iasky et al., 2001). Therefore, the Woodleigh Formation may have been more extensive than presently observed. It is therefore possible that outliers of this unit are present but unrecorded in the outermost portions of the impact structure.","Originally named the  Woodleigh Beds , the unit was defined in an addendum of the summary of Western Australian stratigraphy by McWhae et al. (1958). As recounted therein, a new unit of fine-grained lithologies was first recognized in December 1957 during a reassessment by West Australian Petroleum Pty Ltd (WAPET) of known water-bores drilled across the Gascoyne Platform, based largely on drillers' logs from pastoral station bore books (Playford and Chase, 1955). This reassessment included palynological work conducted by Basil Balme (The University of Western Australia), who interpreted an Early Jurassic age for this new unit. The 'Woodleigh Beds' were renamed the Woodleigh Formation by Denman et al. (1985).  The formation is named after Woodleigh Station, on which the unit was first recorded. The type section is within Woodleigh no. 7 water bore (Zone 50, MGA 275175E 7108068N), between 210-235 m (not Woodleigh no. 1 water bore as cited by Playford et al., 1975). However, the base of the formation is not observed in these sections, and GSWA Woodleigh 2A (Zone 50, MGA 252468E 7115587N) records a more extensive intersection of this unit.",,"Based on the original lithology logs for the Woodleigh water bores (Playford and Chase, 1955), McWhae et al. (1958) described the unit as  monotonous, soft, grey, slightly pyritic shale . However, these driller s logs are not detailed and no samples were retained, making it difficult to compare lithologies with more recently drilled sections (Hocking et al., 1987). As a result, the best description of Woodleigh Formation lithology comes from the fully cored section in GSWA Woodleigh 2A (Mory et al., 2001), with the lithologies described in Carpentaria CB4 (Fewster, 1991) broadly agreeing with the results in this bore hole.  Based on the preserved section in GSWA Woodleigh 2A (Mory et al., 2001), the Woodleigh Formation consists of laminated siltstone and mudstone interbedded with fine- to very fine-grained silty sandstone. These lithologies commonly form fining-up cycles 2-5 m in thickness. Thicker beds of massive claystones are developed throughout, with more localized thin (centimetre-scale) layers of gypsum (at 434 m) or anhydrite (358-367 m). A single granitic clast with shock metamorphic features was recorded at 498 m depth.  The fine-grained lithologies are described as light-grey to dark-grey (and often alternating between the two) or black, firm to friable, strongly carbonaceous, and commonly pyritic. These shale beds regularly contain oblate carbonaceous or lignitic clasts or wood fragments, and slumping is common. Laminae are at the millimetre-scale and form sharp-edged couplets grading from carbonaceous at the base to oxidized at the top.  Silty sandstone is clear to off-white and consists of loose, subangular, subspherical grains. Most of the sandstone is poorly cemented, although clay and silica cements are irregularly developed. Rip-up clasts of carbonaceous shale and silty carbonate nodules are also included within the sandstone beds, particularly towards the base of the section.  Unlike higher up in the section, the basal 20 m of the Woodleigh Formation recorded in GSWA Woodleigh 2A has sandstone dominate over the finer-grained lithologies, with a coincident decrease in the amount of woody material. The basal bed, above the contact with the underlying paraconglomerate unit, is a dark-red to brown sandstone, and woody material is absent in this section.  Overall, the unit shares the regional shallow westerly dip recorded in other pre-Cretaceous sediments of the Southern Carnarvon Basin, suggesting that the tilting was related to the Cretaceous break-up event (Iasky and Mory, 1999).","The Woodleigh Formation is interpreted as a lacustrine succession based on the fine-grained lithologies, restricted distribution, lack of marine fossils (including marine microplankton), and abundance of wood (Hocking et al., 1987; Mory et al., 2001). The restricted distribution within the Woodleigh impact structure further implies that the unit was deposited within a crater lake, formed within the Woodleigh structure sometime after impact (Mory et al., 2001). It is assumed that the crater constrained the lateral extent of this lake, although the few intersections of the formation mean that the original depositional extent is uncertain.  The common preservation of woody fragments and carbonaceous clasts throughout the unit, in combination with a lack of bioturbation, suggests that most of the unit was deposited within a relatively deep, anoxic environment, without (or below the level of) current influence. However, Mory et al. (2001) noted that in GSWA Woodleigh 2A the proportions of sandstone increase and woody material decreases in the basal 20 m of the unit, suggesting that the lake was initially shallow and deepened over time, with anoxic conditions developed later in the water body s history. This idea is supported by the poor preservation and low diversity of palynomorphs seen within the basal part of the formation in this same well. It may similarly explain the poor preservation of palynomorphs from Woodleigh 1982/1 (Ingram, 1982). It was noted that the proportions of reworked Paleozoic palynomorphs increased towards the unit s base (Backhouse, 2001). These may have been transported in from the nearby Merlinleigh or Byro Sub-basins (Iasky and Mory, 1999) during the lake s early development.  The only fossils recorded from the Woodleigh Formation are non-marine palynomorphs and woody material.",,298,,"Throughout its extent, ostensibly within the Woodleigh impact structure, the Woodleigh Formation is unconformably overlain by flat-lying sedimentary rocks of the Winning Group, particularly the Birdrong Sandstone (Hocking et al., 1987; Mory et al., 2001). No outcrops are known. The boundary between the Winning Group and Woodleigh Formation is considered a slight angular unconformity, as the Jurassic section is affected by a westerly regional dip not recorded in the overlying Cretaceous and Cenozoic sediments (Iasky and Mory, 1999).  The basal contact of the Woodleigh Formation is poorly known as few borehole intersections reached the bottom of the unit, including those within the Woodleigh water bores and Carpentaria mineral bores. In mineral bore Woodleigh 1982/1, a unit questionably interpreted as the Woodleigh Formation was considered to lie unconformably over the Silurian Dirk Hartog Group (Layton and Associates Pty Ltd, 1982; Iasky et al., 2001). However, no samples are available from this borehole to support this interpretation. As a result GSWA Woodleigh 2A is the only known section where the bottom of the Woodleigh Formation is clearly observed. In this borehole the Woodleigh Formation is separated from the underlying Dirk Hartog Group by two unnamed units: an upper paraconglomerate and lower breccia (Mory et al., 2001). The exact age and origin of the paraconglomerate is unknown, although the presence of shale clasts yielding Early Permian palynomorphs and shocked quartz grains both suggest that the unit post-dates the Woodleigh impact. The breccia is also of unknown depositional age, but comprises blocks of Upper Silurian dolomite and shale. It is uncertain whether the paraconglomerate and breccia are conformable with each other or surrounding units including the Woodleigh Formation, even though the lack of shock metamorphic features in the breccia suggests that it is unconformable with the overlying paraconglomerate (Mory et al., 2001). Although Mory et al. (2001) considered the basal sandstone in the Woodleigh Formation as a likely transgressive unit, the lack of a sharp contact between the paraconglomerate and the base of the Woodleigh Formation, and presence of shocked grains in the paraconglomerate suggests a short or relatively insignificant depositional break between the units. Based on this, the paraconglomerate may be considered a localized basal member of the Woodleigh Formation.",,17,,,,4,,,,201.3,,169.85,,"Based on palynology, the Woodleigh Formation is considered Early Jurassic in age. During the original definition of the formation McWhae et al. (1958) reported the presence of abundant spores and pollen from Woodleigh no. 1 and 7 water bores, although no formal report describing these microfloras appears to have been published. Nevertheless, based on the addendum in McWhae et al. (1958), the assemblages described as pre-Bajocian Early Jurassic in age almost certainly would have been referred to as Balme s Microfloral Assemblage I, which is currently considered equivalent to both the Callialasporites turbatus and Corollina torosa Spore-Pollen Zones of Helby et al. (1987).  Of the small number of other water and mineral bores in which the Woodleigh Formation is recorded, palynological results were obtained from Swan Resources Woodleigh 1982/1 and Carpentaria CB4 bores. Although the samples from Woodleigh 1982/1 yielded consistent looking assemblages (suggesting that they all belong to a single geological unit), the palynomorph assemblages were poor, containing only angiosperm pollen (likely downhole contaminants), heavily oxidized and unidentifiable palynomorphs, and long-ranging Jurassic to Cretaceous taxa of low biostratigraphic significance. As such, no age could be determined, although Ingram (1982) compared the palynofacies to Early Jurassic  red bed  microfloras of the Perth Basin. Two Carpentaria CB4 samples analyzed for palynomorphs yielded diverse assemblages (Hos, 1991). Although neither assemblage is assigned to any particular palynology zone, the report s range chart indicates an assemblage typical of the C. turbatus Zone in the deeper sample (233-240 m). An additional ditch-cutting sample from an unknown depth and collected at a later date (Backhouse, 2000), yielded a typical C. turbatus Zone assemblage. It is supporting the interpretation of Lower Jurassic sediments in this borehole, as did another sample recorded as from 'near the bottom of the hole' (Backhouse, 1998). New samples from Carpentaria CB2 and Woodleigh no. 1 water bores (of uncertain bore depth) all yielded Cretaceous palynofloras and were interpreted as having derived from the overlying Winning Group.  This age data was confirmed and refined during the drilling of GSWA Woodleigh 2A, where 13 samples were collected from throughout the Woodleigh Formation. Of these samples, those towards the top of the formation yielded rich and diverse assemblages clearly assigned to the C. turbatus Spore-Pollen Zone, and likely the upper part of that zone. The diversity of the palynomorph assemblages decreased down section, with an increasing abundance of Early Permian and Devonian palynomorphs towards the base of the Woodleigh Formation. However, this Paleozoic component was interpreted as a result of reworking, suggesting considerable sedimentary input from older units. Based on the poor in situ assemblages, these deepest samples could only be assigned tentatively to the C. torosa Spore-Pollen Zone, although assemblages close to the C. torosus - C. turbatus Zone boundary recovered higher in the well support the interpretation that the formation extends into this older zone.  Therefore, all of the reliable spore-pollen assemblages recovered from the Woodleigh Formation indicate an Early Jurassic age of either the C. torosa or C. turbatus Zones. It is uncertain whether the lowermost part of the formation falls into the lower or upper part of the Hettangian-Toarcian C. torosa Zone due to the poor preservation of these assemblages. Hence, the base of this zone, presently correlated with the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, is taken as the maximum age of the formation. Since there is some evidence that the Woodleigh Formation extended into the upper C. turbatus Zone and no evidence for the overlying Dictyotosporites complex Spore-Pollen Zone, the boundary between these zones (i.e. the top of the C. turbatus Zone, currently correlated to the middle of the early Bajocian in the Geological Time Scale 2016 age model; <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ga.gov.au/metadata-gateway/metadata/record/gcat_68802 Geoscience Australia, 2016 ) is considered here to form the minimum age of the Woodleigh Formation. This spore-pollen zone boundary is well defined as it is marked by a brief pulse of marine deposition in most Western Australian coastal basins. Marine fossil assemblages of this age in the Perth and Carnarvon Basins allow the event to be reliably correlated to global early Bajocian biozones, based on marine taxa including ammonoids and dinoflagellates.

It has a conformable lower contact with the Cheela Springs Basalt and an unconformable upper contact with the Mount McGrath Formation.

It has a maximum thickness of about 320 m.","The Wooly Dolomite was mapped, although not named, by Daniels (1970) as part of the now obsolete Turee Creek Formation. These rocks were later incorporated within the Wyloo Group by Trendall (1979). Seymour et al. (1988) named the dolostone unit and raised it to formation status because it forms a distinct lithological unit, conformably overlying the Cheela Springs Basalt and unconformably overlain by the Mount McGrath Formation.  The results of recent geochronology studies now indicate that the Wooly Dolomite does not form part of the Wyloo Group. Firstly, a c. 2208 Ma mafic magmatic event, responsible for deposition of the Cheela Springs Basalt and coeval dolerite intrusion into the Beasley River Quartzite and underlying Turee Creek Group, now provides a reliable minimum age for the lower Wyloo Group (Martin et al., 1998; M&uuml;ller et al., 2005; Martin and Morris, 2010). Secondly, the maximum age of the upper Wyloo Group is fixed by ages of c. 2030 and 2008 Ma that were published for the Wooly Dolomite and for dolerite dykes that post-date the lower Wyloo Group, but pre-date the Mount McGrath Formation (M&uuml;ller et al., 2005). These data show that a hiatus of at least 200 Ma took place between the deposition of the lower and upper parts of the Wyloo Group and that this time break was partly coeval with the 2215-2145 Ma Ophthalmia Orogeny in the southern Pilbara region (Rasmussen et al., 2005). This, in turn, has led to a revision of the Wyloo Group, with the lower Wyloo Group (Beasley River Quartzite, Cheela Springs Basalt) now assigned to the Shingle Creek Group and the upper Wyloo Group (Mount McGrath Formation, Duck Creek Dolomite, June Hill Volcanics, and Ashburton Formation) being retained within the revised Wyloo Group (P_-WY-s). The c. 2030 Ma age for the Wooly Dolomite indicates that this unit was laid down separately, following the Ophthalmia Orogeny, in the interval between the deposition of the Shingle Creek and Wyloo Groups.",,"The Wooly Dolomite is composed of thin- to thick-bedded, locally stromatolitic dolostone. Upper parts of the formation are moderately resistant to weathering and erosion and form small cliffs below the Mount McGrath Formation unconformity.  Thorne and Seymour (1991) record a three-fold stratigraphic subdivision of the Wooly Dolomite around Zone 50 MGA 440120E, 7480350N on southeastern WYLOO. Here, the lowermost 70 m is composed of thick, erosively based, lenticular beds of trough cross-stratified, quartzitic pebbly dolostone, together with thin current ripple-laminated quartzitic dolostone, and stromatolitic dolostone. The latter beds are up to 20 m thick and contain large domical stromatolites and some columnar forms. Pebbly dolostones contain fragments of red chert derived from the underlying Cheela Springs Basalt. By contrast, the middle 55 m of the formation are dominated by thin-bedded, parallel-laminated, finely crystalline dolostones and dolomitic mudstones, interbedded with a few thin chert beds. The upper 200 m of the succession are composed of medium- to thick-bedded, finely to coarsely crystalline dolostone. They are locally stromatolitic with medium-scale asymmetric columnar forms. A few quartzitic current-ripple bedforms are preserved in the thin-bedded, parallel-laminated horizons.

It consists predominantly of rhyolite with local thin beds of jaspilitic iron formation. The top of the Woongarra Rhyolite has previously been interpreted to be marked by a 30 m-thick unit of shale, chert, and volcaniclastic sandstone, but this unit is now considered to be part of the disconformably overlying Boolgeeda Iron Formation. The Woongarra Rhyolite conformably overlies the Weeli Wolli Formation and is disconformably overlain by the Boolgeeda Iron Formation. The unit has an average thickness of about 400 m, but thins markedly towards the north and east away from the type locality in the southwestern Hamersley Basin. The large volume (in excess of 15.4 &times; 10 3  km 3 ) and generally uniform internal stratigraphy led to the interpretation of intrusion as two concordant sills. Alternative interpretations involve extrusion as felsic lavas or pyroclastic rocks, with or without subvolcanic sill emplacement between c. 2449 and 2444 Ma.","The Woongarra Rhyolite is mainly exposed in the cores of major regional synclines throughout the central part of the southern Pilbara region on FORTESCUE, PANNAWONICA, MOUNT STUART, WYLOO, HARDEY, ROCKLEA, MILLSTEAM, JEERINAH, MOUNT LIONEL, PARABURDOO, SNOWY MOUNT, ROY HILL, NEWMAN, MURRAMUNDA, and JIGALONG. The Woongarra Rhyolite has an average thickness of about 400 m, although this thickness is highly variable on a regional scale (Trendall, 1995). Figures quoted in the original definition by MacLeod et al. (1963) indicate that the formation thins from south to north across the Brockman Syncline. It is significantly thinner (<300 m) in the Ophthalmia Range to the east. The formation is about 300 m thick on the 1:250 000 map sheets YARRALOOLA (Williams, 1966) and PYRAMID (Kriewaldt and Ryan, 1965) in the far northwestern part of the Hamersley Basin, suggesting an overall northward and eastward thinning away from the type area in the southwest.","The Woongarra Rhyolite was first recognized in the Brockman Syncline by MacLeod et al. (1963) who identified the area around Woongarra Pool (Zone 50, MGA 510428E 7469557N) as the type area and named it the Woongarra Dacite. Later identification of rhyolite within the unit resulted in the name changed to Woongarra Volcanics by de la Hunty (1965). It is now recognized that the bulk of the formation is composed of rhyolite, although chloritic dacite is present near the base in many areas (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). This lead Trendall (1995) to rename it to Woongarra Rhyolite and to propose the section at Woongarra Pool as the type section, in addition to nine widely distributed reference sections. Trendall (1995) further subdivided the Woongarra Rhyolite into informal units, which consist of lower and upper rhyolites. They are separated by a median raft complex composed of banded iron-formation (BIF), shale, and dolerite. This definition does not specifically address the stratigraphic status of the volcaniclastic sandstone, shale, and chert succession between the upper rhyolite and the first BIF of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation, which he later informally assigns to the Woongarra Rhyolite (Trendall, 1995; Trendall et al., 2004).",,"The Woongarra Rhyolite consists predominantly of rhyolite and felsic tuff with lesser BIF, shale, and dolerite. The rhyolite is massive, medium grained, quartz- and/or feldspar-phyric. Geochemical data suggests the presence of rhyolite, rhyodacite, and dacite (Doyle et al., 2001). Flow banding is commonly preserved. Thin BIF horizons, commonly overlying accretionary lapilli tuff beds, are present in the middle of the formation. These BIF horizons have previously been referred to as the  median raft complex  by Trendall (1995). Dolerite sills are rare and not well exposed. However, they are interpreted to be present within the 'median raft complex' in the type section at Woongarra Gorge, reference sections at Duck Creek and Mount Maguire (Trendall, 1995), and southwest of Pinarra Well on HARDEY.","The presence of BIF above, below, and within the Woongarra Rhyolite succession has implications for the interpretation of the depositional environment of the rhyolite as BIF requires a deep-marine depositional setting below storm wave base. Early workers favoured an extrusive origin based on its lava-like lithology (MacLeod et al., 1963; MacLeod, 1966) whereas Trendall (1995) favoured intrusion as a sill during two discreet events. Extrusion as a coherent, viscous silicic magma has been considered incompatible with the large aerial distribution, inferred low-angle depositional slopes, and subaqueous depositional environment of the associated sedimentary rocks. The intrusive hypothesis relies heavily on the interpreted presence of peperites at the upper contact, and the apparent uniform internal stratigraphy across the basin. Some authors favour a combination of subaqueous extrusive and subvolcanic intrusive origins (Horwitz, 1978; Doyle et al., 2001) with the 'median raft complex' (Trendall, 1995), reflecting a major hiatus in volcanism.",,,,"The basal contact of the Woongarra Rhyolite is rarely well exposed and commonly covered by regolith. In the Brockman Syncline, the rhyolite shows a well-exposed, conformable contact with BIF of the underlying Weeli Wolli Formation, and rhyolite at the contact contains swirled flow banding (Trendall, 1995). A similar contact is also preserved in the Buckland Hills (DMMHAM000412, Zone 50, MGA 415104E 7587813N) where dolerite sills are absent from the underlying Weeli Wolli Formation. Elsewhere, for example at Woongarra Gorge and Kalgan Creek (DMMHAM000070, Zone 50, MGA 782771E 7434367N), the contact appears to be intruded by the uppermost dolerite sill in the Weeli Wolli Formation. The top contact of the Woongarra Rhyolite is commonly defined as the base of the first BIF in the overlying Boolgeeda Iron Formation, but the nature of this contact and its precise definition are controversial (Trendall, 1995). Trendall (1995) describes peperite at this contact from a number of locations, but true peperites in this unit are rare and difficult to identify. A unit of interbedded, planar-laminated shale, chert, and tuff of variable thickness is locally present between the uppermost rhyolite and the base of the lowermost BIF of the Boolgeeda Iron Formation. It was previously included in the Woongarra Rhyolite (Trendall, 1995; KrapeÅ¾, et al., 2017). At Fish Pool this unit has been described as peperite by Trendall (1995), but no unequivocal peperite textures are preserved. It is more reasonable to describe it as a volcaniclastic shale and sandstone and to include it in the Boolgeeda Iron Formation.

Reanalysis of this sample by Trendall et al. (2004) yielded an age of 2451 Â± 5 Ma. Later, Barley et al. (1997) obtained an age of 2449 Â± 3 Ma from a nearby unit, assumed by Trendall et al. (2004) to be the same as W101. Pooling of the data for these two samples yielded an age of 2450 Â± 3 Ma, which is commonly regarded as the intrusive age of the upper rhyolite and the Woongarra Rhyolite as a whole (Trendall et al., 2004). These data suggest rapid deposition of both the Weeli Wolli Formation and the Woongarra Rhyolite at about 2450 Ma, prior to intrusion of dolerite sills into the Weeli Wolli Formation and locally into the Woongarra Rhyolite.  A second sample (Trendall et al., 2004) of a tuff bed 18 m above the base of the thin sedimentary unit overlying the upper rhyolite at Woongarra Gorge yielded an age of 2445 Â± 5 Ma. Trendall et al. (2004) could not make a definitive interpretation of this younger age as it was within uncertainty of the intrusive age. Anyhow, it is now regarded as a minimum age for the underlying Woongarra Rhyolite and a maximum depositional age for the Boolgeeda Iron Formation. However, this interpretation is further complicated by a recently obtained age of 2444 Â± 3 Ma (GSWA 195892, M.

It is a predominantly redbed succession of mudstone, calcareous and dolomitic mudstone, with interbeds of sandstone, dolomite and limestone. The formation has three formal members: the thin Dodonea (dominated by limestone and dolomite) and Elsa Sandstone (dominated by massive to cross-bedded sandstone) Members lie at the base of the formation in different areas, while the bulk of the formation is assigned to the Waldecks Member. The Dodonea Member is lower Silurian (Llandovery) in age based on conodonts, but the age of the top of the formation is not well constrained, and may extend into the lower Devonian.  ","The following is modified from Haines (2009). The Worral Formation has widespread distribution south of the Fitzroy Trough and Gregory Sub-basin, although it has been locally removed by pre-Permian erosion, particularly in the west. The thickest development is in the northern Kidson Sub-basin and adjacent areas, with the thickest intersection being 277.5 m in Sahara 1. The average thickness is about 140 m. As the top of the formation always appears to be erosional, all thicknesses are presumably reduced from the original depositional thickness. Sections in the Willara Sub-basin and adjacent Admiral Bay Fault Zone, where preserved, are typically only a few tens of metres in thickness due to extensive pre-Permian erosion.","The Worral Formation was defined by Lehmann (1984) with its type section covering the interval 457-613 m in Barbwire 1. It was named after nearby Worral Range. Prior to 1984 the formation was incorporated, along with the Sahara Formation, into  Carribuddy unit A  of the Carribuddy 'Formation'. Lehmann (1984) recognized the Worral Formation across much of the basin, and the term has been used, although not consistently, in many subsequent well completion reports. It is clear that there have been misunderstandings about the stratigraphic identity and relationships of the Worral Formation leading to erroneous correlations. Some of the confusion is apparently due to the close similarity of facies between the Sahara and Worral Formations. There are three formal members: Dodonea Member (defined by Haines, 2009) Elsa Sandstone Member (defined by Lehmann, 1984) Waldecks Member (defined by Lehmann, 1984; revised by Haines, 2009, to include the 'upper carbonate member' of Lehmann, 1984).",,"The following lithological description of the Worral Formation is modified from Haines (2009). The Worral Formation is dominated by reddish-brown and lesser green and grey mudstone, in part calcareous and dolomitic, with variable content of fine- to medium- and less commonly coarse-grained sandstone, and interbeds of dolomite and limestone. Disseminated evaporite minerals, mainly anhydrite, may be present. The three formal members are described below.        Waldecks Member: Dominated by reddish-brown to grey mudstone, which is often variably calcareous or dolomitic, and contains interbeds of dolomite, limestone, and fine-grained sandstone and dolomite. There is an increased carbonate content near the top in some wells [Lehmann s (1984)  upper carbonate member ]. Minor anhydrite is also common. Significant sandstone sub-units are present in the Kidson Sub-basin and immediately adjacent areas.   Elsa Sandstone Member: Characterized by well sorted porous sandstone, typically fine to medium grained, but locally including coarse and granular beds. It may be relatively massive, or contain interbeds of mudstone and minor carbonate, particularly in the lower part. Grains are dominantly quartz and are typically described as being rounded to well rounded, and displaying a frosted and pitted surface texture. Unlike the younger Tandalgoo Formation, sandstones of which typically display an orange to reddish colour, sandstone in the Elsa Sandstone Member and younger parts of the Worral Formation are typically white to pale grey or pale brown in colour. In the few cored intervals, the sandstone is massive to weakly laminated and locally displays large steep forests (~25&deg;). Soft sediment faulting is common in Boab 1, and secondary pyrite (as veins and nodules) is common in Acacia 1.   Dodonea Member: Dominated by massive to weakly laminated and nodular carbonate, most commonly pale grey to beige dolomite, but including limestone in some wells. Massive carbonate grades to dolomitic or calcareous mudstone at the top. A minor sand component is present in some wells.   ","The following is modified from Haines (2009). The bulk of the Worral Formation (i.e. Waldecks Member) is lithologically indistinguishable from the bulk of the underlying Sahara Formation, and other mudstone-dominated redbed units of the older Carribuddy Group, and therefore is likely to have been deposited under a similar marginal marine evaporitic mud flat environment. The Dodonea Member, bearing conodonts and scolecodonts, suggests a brief period of increased marine influence over parts of the basin were it is present. The well sorted and porous Elsa Sandstone Member is most likely at least partly or locally of eolian origin. Porous sandstone units in the upper part of the formation in the Kidson Sub-basin are also likely of eolian origin.",,277.5,,,,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,443.4,,393.3,,"Conodonts recovered from core of the Dodonea Member in Acacia 1 and Boab 1 give an age of Llandovery (early Silurian) for the lower Worral Formation based on the presence of  Ozarkodina hassi  (Nicoll et al., 1994).

(1994) reported Pridoli (late Silurian) fish remains from the 'Sahara Formation' in Sahara 1, but Haines (2009) considered it more likely that the interval is upper Worral Formation. Likewise, the stratigraphic position of Devonian conodonts and fish remains in Gingerah Hill 1 (Nicoll and Young, 1987) is disputed, but could be upper Worral Formation (Haines, 2009). The depth interval of a mid-Devonian ostracod and foraminifera bearing sample in Boab 1, previously reported as derived from the upper Dodonea Member, is now indeterminate, but could come from the upper Worral Formation (see discussion in Haines, 2009).

(1971) reported occurrences of andalusite 'granofels' on Gibbings Island, Dunvert Island, and also 6 km south of Wotjulum Mission. All these localities are in the Elgee Siltstone where it has been intruded extensively by the Wotjulum Porphyry.

The group has an estimated maximum thickness of about 9 km.","The Wyloo Group was named and subdivided by MacLeod et al. (1963), and later incorporated within the Mount Bruce Supergroup of the Hamersley Basin (Halligan and Daniels, 1964). Under this scheme the group was made up of five formations (in ascending order): the Turee Creek Formation, Beasley River Quartzite, Mount McGrath Formation (including the Cheela Springs Basalt Member), Duck Creek Dolomite, and Ashburton Formation. Trendall (1975, 1979) pointed out however, that there were no descriptions of type sections or type localities for any of these constituent formations or members. The name  Wyloo Group  and names of principal formations have, nevertheless, been widely applied during the 1:250 000 geological mapping of the southern Pilbara region (de la Hunty, 1964; Daniels and MacLeod, 1965; Daniels, 1967, 1968, 1970; Williams, 1966). Largely as a result of this usage, the informal nomenclature became generally accepted, although it has been amended to include additional units, such as the Wooly Dolomite and June Hill Volcanics, in middle and upper parts of the stratigraphy, respectively (Seymour et al., 1988).  The recognition of a major unconformity within the lower part of the Wyloo Group prompted significant revision of the Mount Bruce Supergroup (Trendall, 1979). The Turee Creek Formation and part of the Beasley River Quartzite were combined to form a new stratigraphic unit, the Turee Creek Group. As a consequence, the Mount Bruce Supergroup was restructured to include the Fortescue, Hamersley and Turee Creek Groups. The Wyloo Group was regarded as a separate lithological entity whose lowermost formation, the redefined Beasley River Quartzite, unconformably overlies the Mount Bruce Supergroup.  Horwitz (1980) also recognized the presence of a regional disconformity within the Wyloo Group at the top of the Cheela Springs Basalt Member. Consequently, the author removed these rocks from the Mount McGrath Formation and at the same time upgraded them to the level of formation. The Mount McGrath Formation was then defined as  the essentially clastic rocks that overlie disconformably the Cheela Springs Basalt and overlap unconformably onto older formations. It is overlain conformably by the Duck Creek Dolomite, which itself overlaps onto older units. . This definition was followed by Seymour et al. (1988) and Thorne and Seymour (1991), with the qualification that the Mount McGrath Formation also unconformably overlies the Wooly Dolomite that is locally present on top of the Cheela Springs Basalt along the southeastern margin of the Wyloo Dome.  Although the disconformity at the base of the Mount McGrath Formation was recognized by various workers (Horwitz, 1980; Seymour et al., 1988; Thorne and Seymour, 1991), its temporal significance was unknown and did not lead to a redefinition of the Wyloo Group. More recently a c. 2208 Ma mafic magmatic event &mdash; responsible for the deposition of the Cheela Springs Basalt and coeval dolerite intrusion into the Beasley River Quartzite and underlying Turee Creek Group &mdash; has been identified and provides a reliable age for the lower part of the Wyloo Group (Martin et al., 1998; M&uuml;ller et al., 2005; Martin and Morris, 2010). By contrast, the maximum age of the upper Wyloo Group is fixed by ages of c. 2030 and 2008 Ma that were published for the Wooly Dolomite and for dolerite dykes that post-date the lower Wyloo Group but pre-date the Mount McGrath Formation (M&uuml;ller et al., 2005). These data show that a hiatus of at least 200 Ma separated deposition of the lower and upper parts of the Wyloo Group and that this time break was partly coeval with the 2215-2145 Ma Ophthalmia Orogeny in the southern Pilbara region (Rasmussen et al., 2005). This requires a further revision of the Wyloo Group, with the lower Wyloo Group (Beasley River Quartzite, Cheela Springs Basalt) now being assigned to the Shingle Creek Group, and the upper Wyloo Group (Mount McGrath Formation, Duck Creek Dolomite, June Hill Volcanics, and Ashburton Formation) being retained within the revised Wyloo Group. The c. 2030 Ma age for the Wooly Dolomite indicates that this unit was laid down separately, following the Ophthalmia Orogeny, in the interval between deposition of the Shingle Creek and Wyloo Groups.",,"The Wyloo Group is composed of sandstone, siltstone, pebbly sandstone, conglomerate, and dolostone, together with minor mafic and felsic volcanic rocks and banded iron-formation. It is subdivided into four formations (in ascending order): the Mount McGrath Formation (P_-WYm-sp), Duck Creek Dolomite (P_-WYd-kd), June Hill Volcanics (P_-WYj-b), and Ashburton Formation (P_-WYa-s).  The Mount McGrath Formation is composed of ferruginous sandstone, conglomerate, and pebbly sandstone, together with quartz sandstone and siltstone. Dolostone and dolomitic siltstone are also present in upper parts of the stratigraphy. The Duck Creek Dolomite consists of thin- to very thick-bedded, buff or grey-mauve-weathering dolostone. It is commonly stromatolitic or brecciated, and silicification is locally intense. The June Hill Volcanics is composed of mafic to felsic volcanic rocks interbedded with a diverse assemblage of non-volcanic sedimentary rocks. The volcanic rocks range from coherent mafic lava, pillow lava and fine- to very coarse-grained mafic to felsic volcaniclastic rock. The Ashburton Formation is composed of mudstone and siltstone and thin- to very thick-bedded lithic quartz sandstone, together with minor pebble- to cobble-conglomerate, felsic to mafic volcanic rock, banded iron-formation and chert, and dolostone. Parts of the stratigraphy that contain significant thicknesses of sandstone, conglomerate, felsic volcanic rock, mafic volcanic rock, and banded iron-formation and chert have been mapped as separate members (P_-WYa-st, P_-WYa-stq, P_-WYa-sc, P_-WYa-f, P_-WYa-bbo, and P_-WYa-ca, respectively).  The metamorphic grade of the Wyloo Group is low and characterized by the mineral assemblage quartz-chlorite-muscovite(-sericite) in pelitic and psammitic rocks. There is, however, a general increase in grade and schistosity towards the west and southwest. On northern ULLAWARRA, medium grade metamorphosed equivalents of the Ashburton Formation are represented by quartz-muscovite-biotite-cordierite-andalusite-garnet schist (P_-WYa-mh), that indicate medium-grade metamorphic conditions.","The Wyloo Group was deposited in the Ashburton Basin, an area of coastal to deep-marine sedimentation that flanked the western and southern margin of the Pilbara Craton during the middle to late Paleoproterozoic. Lower Wyloo Group sedimentation (Mount McGrath Formation) took place following post-Ophthalmia Orogeny deformation and uplift in the southern Pilbara region. Coarse-grained siliciclastic detritus was laid down on gravelly, braided deltas that fringed the northeastern margin of the Ashburton Basin. Mud and carbonate were deposited in open shelf waters farther to the south and west. Maximum development of the deltaic complex took place during the deposition of the lower Mount McGrath Formation. Middle and upper parts of the formation record a gradual waning of siliciclastic supply, which was accompanied by a deepening of shelf waters throughout the basin.  Carbonate rocks of the Duck Creek Dolomite conformably overly the Mount McGrath Formation and are dominated by stromatolitic inner-shelf facies and thin-bedded or conglomeratic outer-shelf and slope facies. Deposition of the lower Duck Creek Dolomite took place in a relatively deep water, shelf or slope environment that existed along the northeastern margin of the basin. To the north and east, a belt of shallow marine, inner shelf carbonate deposition fringed the low-relief Pilbara Craton. The carbonate shelf underwent a major episode of progradation during the deposition of the middle Duck Creek Dolomite. The upper parts of the formation were laid down in a gradually deepening basin, which received increasing amounts of fine-grained siliciclastic detritus (Thorne and Seymour, 1991). North of the Wyloo Dome, mafic to felsic volcanic rocks of the June Hill Volcanics were deposited in a coastal to shallow marine setting.  The uppermost Wyloo Group (Ashburton Formation) was deposited in a linear, deep-sea submarine fan environment. Most sediment deposited in the southeastern and central Ashburton Basin was derived from a Paleoproterozoic granitic source in the eastern Capricorn Orogen (Thorne and Seymour, 1991; Sircombe, 2003). Detritus from a second granitic terrane in the region of the present-day Gascoyne Province, was laid down in the central Ashburton Basin. Volcanic and sedimentary rock fragments from the Mount Bruce Supergroup and June Hill Volcanics were deposited in a third submarine fan complex, located to the northwest of the Wyloo Dome.  Geochronological data from the Ashburton Formation and June Hill Volcanics provides evidence for strongly diachronous sedimentation in the upper Wyloo Group. It is therefore likely that some of the siliciclastic rocks of the Ashburton Formation are coeval with parts of the Duck Creek Dolomite and were deposited in a longitudinal, deep submarine-fan complex, located farther offshore from the fringing carbonate ramp that formed the main depocentre for the Duck Creek Dolomite.  The tectonic setting of the Wyloo Group is thought to be an intracratonic foreland basin associated with the onset of crustal reworking during the 1820-1770 Ma Capricorn Orogeny, although Martin and Morris (2010) suggest that the setting may have been extensional in its early stages. This is in contrast to previous interpretations that invoked a marginal foreland basin setting linked to the early stages of a collision between the Pilbara and Yilgarn Cratons (Tyler and Thorne, 1990; Thorne and Seymour, 1991; Evans et al., 2003). This collisional event (which also included the Glenburgh Terrane of the Gascoyne Province) has now been shown to have taken place during the 2005-1950 Ma Glenburgh Orogeny (Occhipinti et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 2010).   An alternative interpretation was proposed by Krapez (1999) who argued that the tectonic setting for the Wyloo Group evolved from a mature, passive margin and failed rift environment to a back-arc setting on a convergent continental margin.",,9000,,"The Wyloo Group unconformably overlies the Fortescue, Hamersley, Turee Creek, and Shingle Creek Groups, and the Wooly Dolomite.

In addition, the Wyloo Group unconformably overlies the Wooly Dolomite, from which M&uuml;ller et al. (2005) acquired a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon depositional age of 2031 Â± 6 Ma.

The younger age limit for the Ashburton Formation is also constrained by the age of the Boolaloo Granodiorite (P_-MObo-ggbp) that intrudes the Ashburton Formation on BOOLALOO, CANE RIVER, and MOUNT STUART, and the age of felsic volcanic units, the Koonong Member (P_-CPbk-fn) of the Bywash Formation, at the base of the unconformably overlying Capricorn Group. SHRIMP U-Pb ages of 1796 Â± 9 Ma (GSWA 169885, Wingate et al., 2014) and 1786 Â± 5 Ma (KrapeÅ¾ and McNaughton, 1999) have been obtained for the Boolaloo Granodiorite. Evans et al. (2003) also obtained a closely similar age (1786 Â± 11 Ma) from an unnamed quartz-feldspar porphyry within the Ashburton Formation on CANE RIVER. Pidgeon and Horwitz (1991) had previously reported an age of 1828 Â± 38 Ma based on a multigrain analysis of zircons from the same porphyry. Hall et al. (2001) reported a SHRIMP U-Pb age of 1804 Â± 7 Ma for an accretionary lapilli tuff within the Koonong Member. Two additional SHRIMP U-Pb dates of 1800 Â± 7 Ma and 1801 Â± 6 Ma (Wingate et al., 2017a,b) have also been obtained from accretionary lapilli tuffs of the Koonong Member. Considering that all felsic units within the upper part of the Ashburton Formation, and lower part of the unconformably overlying Capricorn Group are within uncertainty of each other, the date obtained by Evans et al. (2003) of c. 1799 Ma for the June Hill Volcanics is here taken to be the best estimate of the maximum age the Ashburton Formation. The distinct overlap in dates also indicate that uplift and isoclinal folding of the Ashburton Formation during the D 1n  event of the Capricorn Orogeny must have taken place within a very short time frame of 5 to 6 million years. It is equally possible that sedimentation across the Ashburton Basin was diachronous (Tyler and Thorne, 1990; Thorne and Seymour, 1991; Evans et al., 2003), so that the Duck Creek Dolomite, June Hill Volcanics, and Ashburton Formation are partly coeval and represent sediment-starved shelf margin and equivalent offshore deep submarine fan facies.

These sills are anhydrous and tholeiitic with a bulk composition of komatiitic basalt. Hornblende is commonly present in the thin upper chill zones of the sills, but this is considered to reflect interaction with hydrous host rocks. Most of the sills were emplaced into felsic volcaniclastic rocks and banded iron-formation of the Greensleeves and Wilgie Mia Formations near the top of the Polelle Group. These sills have previously been described in Watkins &amp; Hickman (1990), and assigned to a suite in Van Kranendonk and Ivanic (2009), and they are interpreted to have been emplaced primarily at shallow levels. They are predominantly gabbroic, with bases of pyroxenite and peridotite cumulate rocks, and tops of leucogabbro and local, thin anorthosite. Coarse-grained, feathery-textured, pegmatitic hornblende leucogabbro is commonly exposed at the upper contacts with country rock. Pegmatitic phases have been targeted for geochronology and have yielded several interpreted magmatic crystallization ages of between 2735 Ma and 2711 Ma.  Geochronology data suggest that the intrusion of these rocks was likely contemporaneous with the eruption of komatiitic basalts of the Wattagee Formation of the Glen Group and with emplacement of granitic rocks of the early part of the Big Bell Suite (Ivanic et al., 2012). Whilst the majority of the Yalgowra Suite sills form steeply dipping sheets parallel to shear zones, the larger intrusions are often part of tight-isoclinal folds with near vertical hinges.","The distribution of the suite is similar to the distribution of the upper Polelle Group, covering an approximately 180 x 180 km region in the northwestern Youanmi Terrane. The suite outcrops on MEEKATHARRA, KOONMARRA,TIERACO, MADOONGA, CUE, REEDY and DALGARANGA.","The Yalgowra Suite of the Austin Downs Supersuite (Van Kranendonk et al., 2013) is named after Yalgowra Hill (Zone 50, MGA 593000E 7015000N), which is located on MADOONGA. Previously these rocks had been assigned to various formations of the supracrustal stratigraphy (Watkins and Hickman, 1990).   The type locality is a traverse at Wattagee Hill where a series of Yalgowra Suite sills (at least 3) intrude into the Greensleeves Formation (A-POg-f) near the top of the Polelle Group stratigraphy. The thickness of the sills varies from 20 to 2000 m throughout a four kilometre thick section. These intrude up to a level 50 m below the base of the Glen Group. At the start of the traverse (Zone 50, MGA 586483E 6989331N) is a metadunite in which relict olivine cumulate texture is locally preserved. At site TJIWIN090073 (Zone 50, MGA 586324E 6989390N) there is an overlying, ~30 m thick layer of clinopyroxenite, which comprises >90% stubby clinopyroxene crystals up to 5 mm in a light green matrix. Note the old drill collars in the low area immediately east of this ridge, where exploration for nickel-copper mineralization was undertaken in the 1980s. To the northwest of here is 300 m of massive gabbro. Another sill further northwest has a pegmatoidal leucogabbro top contact (Zone 50, MGA 585209E 6989390N) and baked metasedimentary and volcanosedimentary host rocks in the vicinity of TJICUE000064 (Zone 50, MGA 585524E 6990445N).",,"Lithologically, the suite is predominantly gabbroic-gabbronoritic, with bases of pyroxenite, and peridotite cumulate up to 100 m thick, and tops of leucogabbro and local, thin anorthosite (up to 10m thick). More melanocratic gabbronorites towards the base of the sills typically show orthopyroxene cumulate texture with equant orthopyroxene cumulate crystals up to 20 mm in diameter. In the middle of the sills, clinopyroxene is typically more abundant than orthopyroxene and cumulate texture is less common. Here the dominant texture is sub-ophitic with 5-12 mm plagioclase laths partially enclosed by clinopyroxene. In the upper half of the sills the gabbro progressively grades upwards into leucogabbro.   In a few of the thicker sills there may be up to 10 m thicknesses of anorthosite.

It occurs in the Meekatharra-Wydgee greenstone belt on MEEKATHARRA and GABANINTHA, where steep ridges are formed by variably deformed and metamorphosed banded iron-formation, which often co-inside with aeromagnetic highs, while felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rock and siliciclastic sediments are forming flats, or can only be identified in drill core beneath a regolith cover.  North of the Lady Alma Igneous Complex on GABANNINTHA, the Yaloginda Formation is intercalated with mafic rocks of the Murrouli Basalt (A-NOm-mb) and bound by the Quinns Basalt (A-NOq-b).  Along strike in continuation of the southern tip of the greenstone belt on REEDY exposure of mafic members of the Yaloginda Formation can be traced in the Mount Magnet greenstone belt on REEDY, WYNYANGOO, AUSTIN and MOUNT MAGNET. Whereas on CHALLA, COOLAMANIU and BUNGAR transposed unit of felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks are present. Often relict and slivers of the Yaloginda Formation are found in the vicinity of the large igneous complexes, such as Windimurra, Youanmi and Lady Alma.  Isolated volcanic centres have formed thick packages of felsic and felsic volcaniclastic sequences with minor sedimentary input. The Yuinmery Volcanics Member crops out at the NE corner of YOUANMI, mainly north of the Paynes Find -Sandstone Road, the Youangarra Volcanics Member is exposed c. 7 km to the W along the Paynes Find -Sandstone Road, it westernmost exposure on the western side of the Youanmi Mine and can be traced for c. 29 km in a N-S direction. The Kantie Murdanna Volcanics Member is exposed mainly S of the Mount Magnet - Sandstone Road for c. 30 km in SW direction on CHALLA. The western extend intersects the road turnoff to the Mount Magnet Windsor Road.  The type section of the Yaloginda Formation crosses a regional scale fold structure which experienced low to moderate metamorphic overprint, and starts 1 km NNW of the Globe Mine and 1.3 km S of Paddys Flat Mine (Zone 50, MGA 649404E 7053275N) on the map sheet boundary between MEEKATHARRA and GABANINTHA for 3.5 km towards the ESE (Zone 50, MGA 652652E 7052311N). The traverse starts in area with diverse felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks (A-NOy-fn) of mainly andesitic composition, which are not as extensive as the separately described Youangarra, Yuinmery and Kantie Murdanna Volcanics Member. The maximum thickness of the felsic package is 700 -900m. Some of the horizons seem to be well bedded, while others are agglomerates of volcaniclastic origin (e.g. JRLGAB000631, Zone 50, MGA 649338E 7053151N). Usually the unit forms flats with low, quite often schistose to rubbly outcrop style. Generally the felsic components have low magnetic response. Whereas the adjacent unit of cm- to dm thick layered chert, banded Iron-Formation and jasperlite-bearing banded Iron-Formation (A-NOy-cx) sits above a magnetic high. The unit comprises several parallel ridges, which have not been traced out individually due to scale of mapping.  The next section of the travers crosses c. 950 m wide flat of rubbly felsic volcanic rocks (A-NOy-fn), which have been dated at 2812 Â±7 Ma (Wang, 1998) (e.g. JRLGAB000072, Zone 50, MGA 650774E 7053122N). Followed by another steep ridge, again formed by finely laminated chert and minor jasperlite-bearing banded iron-Formation (A-NOy-cx), sitting above an aeromagnetic high. The next entity is c. 850 m wide mixed unit (A-NOy-xf-cib) comprising fine grained coherent felsic volcanic rocks, minor sedimentary rocks (e.g. CJFMEE000534, Zone 50, MGA 652326E 7054241N)), and jasperlite-bearing banded Iron-Formation, this section might represent a zone of higher degree of shearing, nevertheless siliciclastic components have not been observed in the previously described units. ","The Yaloginda Formation is named after the Yaloginda Mining Centre close to Yaloginda Bore (Zone 50, MGA 642955E 7049938N) c. 10 km SSE of town of Meekatharra on MEEKATHARRA.  The Yaloginda Formation was first introduced by VanKranendonk and Ivanic (2007) in the new stratigraphic scheme of Murchison Domain in Youanmi Terrane. The formation includes rocks which have formerly been assigned to the Golconda Formation after Keith et al. (1990).  ",,"The main lithologies of the Yaloginda Formation are felsic volcanic rocks and banded iron-formation, which experienced a variable degree of metamorphism and deformation. Nevertheless primary igneous and sedimentary textures are still preserved. The felsic volcanic rocks are formed by dacitic to andesite flow units, which are describe as partly containing porphyritic plagioclase lath. The felsic volcaniclastic components comprise fine-grained, well bedded volcaniclastic sediments, as well as agglomerates.  Another major component of Yaloginda Formation are fine grained sediments, which comprise quartzite, chert and banded iron-formation. The latter is often described as jasperlite-bearing. Siliciclastic sediments on the other hand seem to be rather rare, and only locally developed. Narrow, poorly exposed ultramafic rocks and fine grained mafic rocks, subparallel to the bedding of the banded iron formation, which are presumed to be intrusive, and therefore younger than the banded iron formation. These mafic/ultramafic rock are deeply weathered, and only poorly exposed.   Banded iron formation exposed in ridges surrounding the Nowthanna Hill area displays pronounced proximal, intermediate, and distal hydrothermal alteration zones that mirror the distribution of hydrothermal alteration intensity observed in underlying rhyolite-dominant footwall rocks.  In the 2825-2805 Ma Norie Group in the northern Murchison Domain VMS mineralization at Austin and Chunderloo is associated with petrochemically prospective felsic rocks of the Yaloginda Formation, and at Just Desserts it is associated with a calc-alkaline basaltic unit of the Yaloginda Formation (Hassan, 2014). Geochemically similar felsic rocks of the Kantie Murdana Volcanics Member, which overlies the Windimurra Igneous Complex in the central Youanmi Terrane (Fig. 11), also host significant VMS mineralization. Significant VMS occurrences have been identified in association with the Narndee, Youanmi, Windimurra and Lady Alma Igneous Complexes (Hollis et al. 2017). These Igneous complexes are often flanked by Norie Group rocks, especially the felsic succession of the Yaloginda Formation. In the Quinns district of Gabanitha area (NOWTHANNA and GABANINTHA) Volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VMS) occur within the BIF units assigned to the Yaloginda Formation (Duuring et al. 2016). The Flinders and Tasman prospects for example have 1- to 2-m-thick BIF-hosted Cu-Zn-rich gossans that are conformably underlain by <400 m wide, proximal alteration zones of chlorite and talc-altered rhyolite, with minor disseminated magnetite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite. Two other exposures of chlorite- or talc-altered rhyolite are located north of the Murchison Wonder prospect and 1.5 km southeast of the Tasman prospect, but are not spatially associated with any known occurrences of BIF-hosted massive sulfides (Duuring et al. 2016).",,,,,,,17,,,Mixed,4,,,,2815,,2800,,"The Yaloginda Formation is composed of a lower felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, with minor sedimentary rocks.

Most of the intrusion is exposed as rubbly outcrops along the flanks of creeks incised into an old land surface. Smaller, isolated exposures toward the western edge of MARQUIS probably consist of a series of sheets. The latter are assigned to the Yamagee Granite because they have only one foliation and, unlike low-strain equivalents of the granitic gneisses, they intruded amphibolite lenses that had a pre-existing foliation.","The Yamagee Granite is named after the Yamagee Bore (Zone 50, MGA 568640E 7190550N) on MARQUIS.",,"The Yamagee Granite consists of two phases: variably foliated, medium- to fine-grained, equigranular biotite metamonzogranite (P_-BBya-mge)(P_-BBya-mgm), which forms the bulk of the intrusion, and a composite sheet-like body of foliated, medium-grained, porphyritic, biotite metamonzogranite (P_-BBya-mgp)(P_-BBya-mgmu). There is no sharp contact between the two phases; rather, it is a transition from sheets of dominantly one rock type to sheets dominantly of the other. Contacts between individual sheets are parallel to the foliation in the intrusion, and thus the relative ages of the rock types cannot be established. Leucocratic biotite-garnet metamonzogranite is a minor component of the equigranular phase.  The Yamagee Granite ranges from weakly foliated to locally strongly foliated and moderately well banded. Pegmatite veins and thin dykes are widespread, but only locally abundant. The veins and dykes are commonly parallel to the foliation in the granite. In places, the veins and the foliation are folded about mesoscopic, upright, isoclinal D 2n  folds. Weakly deformed samples of the equigranular phase consist of a few percent subhedral microcline phenocrysts in a fine- to medium-grained, granular groundmass of plagioclase, microcline, quartz, and biotite. Magnetite, zircon, and apatite are accessory minerals. Strongly deformed samples have a foliation defined by seams of biotite and a grain-flattening fabric defined by tabular quartz and plagioclase crystals.

However, it is commonly grouped with the Joffre Member for mapping purposes, owing to the generally poor exposure and difficulty in defining the upper and lower contacts. Early workers reported that the member is locally enriched in iron. Nevertheless, it remains a poorly studied unit. The Yandicoogina Shale Member is about 60 m-thick and consists entirely of alternating thin shale and chert beds, similar to the upper part of the Whaleback Shale Member. It conformably overlies the Joffre Member and is conformably overlain by the Weeli Wolli Formation, although this contact is commonly intruded by dolerite sills. The Yandicoogina Shale Member is interpreted to have been deposited in a deep-water pelagic to hemipelagic environment between c. 2459 and 2451 Ma.","The Yandicoogina Shale Member is generally considered to be about 60 m thick (Trendall and Blockley, 1970; Harmsworth et al., 1990).

In areas where it is not covered by Cenozoic units, the Yandicoogina Shale Member forms a narrow recessive weathering unit between the uppermost resistant banded iron-formation (BIF) of the Joffre Member and the lowermost BIF within the Weeli Wolli Formation.","The Yandicoogina Shale Member was informally recognized by Ryan and Blockley (1965) and later formally defined by Trendall and Blockley (1970). The name is derived from the many good exposures in the drainage basin of Yandicoogina Creek (Zone 50, MGA722208E 7474284N) and the type section is in the main stream of the creek. A well-exposed and accessible reference section is also present in Cathedral Gorge (Zone 50, MGA 768555E 7423647N) on the Great Northern Highway, 15 km northwest of Newman.",,"The Yandicoogina Shale Member consists entirely of alternating thin shale and chert beds, similar to the upper part of the Whaleback Shale Member (Trendall and Blockley, 1970). The member is generally not well exposed, and because of its stratigraphic position in an economically unimportant part of the succession, there are no drillhole intersections. Outcrops are rare and its location often has to be inferred based on its topographic expression as a narrow recessive unit that separates the uppermost BIF of the Joffre Member from the lowermost BIF of the Weeli Wolli Formation. Identification of the unit is further complicated by the presence of dolerite sills in some areas. These may be assigned to either the Yandicoogina Shale Member or the Weeli Wolli Formation depending on their field expression. The cherts are distinctively wavy bedded and yellow-weathered (Kepert, 2018).","The depositional environment of the Yandicoogina Shale Member is interpreted to be similar to other shale-dominated units within the Hamersley Group, viz. deep-water pelagic to hemipelagic sedimentation dominated by dilute turbidity currents. Nevertheless, direct evidence for a coeval carbonate platform is currently lacking for this interval.",,60,,"Contact relationships of the Yandicoogina Shale Member are difficult to determine owing to its poor exposure. However, it is inferred to conformably overlie the Joffre Member at the top of the Brockman Iron Formation, and, in turn, is conformably overlain by the Weeli Wolli Formation. The unit is locally intruded by dolerite sills, which complicate the contact relationships.

It is dominated by dolomite and evaporite rocks in the Shark Bay region. The evaporite is mostly halite in the Yaringa 1 - Tamala 1 area, but gypsum in the less evaporitic section in Coburn 1 (Yasin and Mory, 1999) nearer the basin margin but still thicker than in some wells nearer Shark Bay. Mory et al. (1998) extended the formation northwards to Pendock 1 based on conodont faunas and log signatures, to include a dominantly sandstone interval. The thickness is generally 55 to 65 m, with a probable maximum of 105 m in Yaringa 1. It is Early Silurian (late Llandovery) in age, based on sparse conodont faunas described by Mory et al. (1998). The Yaringa Formation appears to lens out to the southeast, as the overlying Coburn Formation rests directly on the Marron Member of the underlying Ajana Formation in that area.  The Yaringa Formation was deposited mostly in very shallow coastal lagoons and brine pools, with limited connections to open marine environments, in a continued hot arid climate. Gorter et al. (1994) considered that the bromine content of the evaporates in the Yaringa area, uniformly less than 450 ppm, indicated marine to restricted conditions, rather than non-marine, for which bromine would be much more abundant. The depocentre was around Yaringa 1, based on the thickness and abundance of halite in that well. Post-depositional salt migration and halotectonics appear to have been minimal.   ","The evaporitic facies of the Yaringa Formation are present in the Shark Bay area, and a correlative 94 m thick sandstone interval to the north in Pendock 1. The maximum known thickness is the type section in Yaringa 1 (105 m) - other intersections range from 69 m in Coburn 1 (where it is less evaporitic, with gypsum near the top of the formation), to 59 m in Hamelin Pool 2 and 54  m in Tamala 1. It is absent in the southeast Gascoyne Platform, where Coburn Formation sits directly over Marron Member (Mory et al., 1998) and Yaringa Formation and the Ajana Formation may not have been deposited.  Note the thicknesses and depth picks given by Gorter et al. (1994) are inconsistent and in places incorrect - correct depths are in Iasky and Mory (1999, Appendix 4).","The Yaringa Formation was proposed by Playford et al. (1975), as 'Yaringa Evaporite Member' for Henderson and Shannon's (1966) informal 'Unit B' of the 'Dirk Hartog Formation'. Playford et al. described the unit briefly and proposed a type section in Yaringa 1, between 1195 and 1271 m depth.  Gorter et al. (1994) elevated the Dirk Hartog Formation to group status, and the Yaringa Evaporite Member to Yaringa Evaporite, and described the latter in moderate detail, in part from a sequence stratigraphic viewpoint.  Mory et al. (1998) used the name Yaringa Formation as they recognized the unit beyond the extent of evaporitic facies, using conodont faunas and electric log response, to a predominantly sandstone interval in Pendock 1 between 2191.5 and 2286 m. This section could be considered a reference section. Iasky and Mory (1999) placed the base at 1300 m rather than 1271 m, thereby including some carbonate beneath a dominantly evaporitic interval.",,"The Yaringa Formation is dominated by dolomite and evaporite rocks in the Shark Bay region. The evaporite is mostly halite in the Yaringa 1 - Tamala 1 area, but gypsum in the less evaporitic, presumably more marginal section in Coburn 1 (Yasin and Mory, 1999). The most detailed descriptions of the unit are by Yasin and Mory (1999), of the section in Coburn 1. The dolomite is mostly cryptocrystalline to microcrystalline, partly oolitic, laminated and interbedded with salt-bearing dark grey shale and evaporites (Gorter et al., 1994). Coarse-grained lithoclastic grainstone is also present (Hocking et al., 1987). Oolitic grainstone is present near the base of the formation in Coburn 1 (Yasin and Mory, 1999). Anhydrite is common, as fracture fillings, thin beds and in nodules. A red or brown colouration is common, although it may be in part due to recent oxidation in older, unsealed cores.  The correlative sandstone in Pendock 1 is described in the well completion report as white to light grey and very fine to medium grained, locally grading to coarse grained with very coarse grains. It is poorly to moderately sorted and well cemented, and grains are sub-angular. There is minor interbedded dark brown cryptocrystalline to microcrystalline dolomite, silty shale and varicoloured siltstone.    Bedded halite is present in the Yaringa area (Wells, 1980; Gorter et al., 1994), with seven separate intervals in Hamelin Pool 2, each between 2 and 10 m thick (Wells, 1980). The halite is reasonably pure, although some sylvite is present (Hocking et al, 1987). Anhydrite was noted as very common in Dirk Hartog 17B as beds, lenses and fracture fills, with some cores as much as 25% anhydrite.  The reasonably consistent thickness of the formation suggests post-depositional halotectoncs and salt migration have been minor. Contorted bedding was noted in the Well Summary Report for Dirk Hartog 17B, and may well be enterolithic deformation of evaporitic material rather than simple soft sediment slumping."," The Yaringa Formation was deposited mostly in very shallow coastal lagoons and brine pools, with limited intermittent connections to open marine environments, in a continued hot arid climate (Yasin and Mory, 1999) similar to that which prevailed during deposition of the Dirk Hartog Group.

The gneisses are commonly weathered, but exposure is good.",,,"Reworked granitic gneiss consists of two mappable units: leucocratic granitic gneiss (AP_-mgnl-YNAY) and mesocratic granitic gneiss (AP_-mgnw-YNAY). Of these two units, leucocratic granitic gneiss is by far the most voluminous and widespread. Mesocratic granitic gneiss is the dominant type of gneiss only in the eastern part of MARQUIS, north of the Morris Fault.  Leucocratic granitic gneiss comprises medium-grained leucocratic gneiss with thin, discontinuous layers of biotite, and fine- to medium-grained, strongly banded, leucocratic granitic gneiss. Lower strain domains of the gneiss indicate that the precursors were mainly medium- and coarse-grained monzogranite and granodiorite.  The bulk of the mesocratic granitic gneiss is composed of fine- to medium-grained, strongly banded, biotite-rich granitic gneiss with 10-20% layer-parallel veins of pegmatite and coarse-grained granite. The rocks consist of dark-grey, biotite-rich layers about 1-4 cm thick, alternating with paler, more quartzofeldspathic layers up to 2 cm thick.

Most of the zircons define a weighted mean  207 Pb*/ 206 Pb* date 3292 Â± 4 Ma, interpreted as the crystallization age of the monzogranite precursor (Nelson, 1998). A sample of mesocratic granitic gneiss about 2 km northeast of Jubilee Bore on MARQUIS contains components with ages ranging from early to late Archean (Nelson, 1998). Two concordant analyses indicating a mean date of 2637 Â± 3 Ma provide an estimate of the age of the youngest component in the gneiss, and hence a minimum age for its formation, although zircons as old as 3352 Â± 4 Ma, indicating that the gneiss contains much older components.  Sheets and veins of porphyritic to equigranular, medium to very coarse grained metagranite and pegmatite (P_-MO-mgmp) form an intimate part of the reworked granitic gneiss, and were intruded during deformation and metamorphism (Sheppard and Swager, 1999).

It has been affected by hydrothermal alteration during the impact event, which also introduced veins of quartz, pseudotachylite, and muscovite-bearing pegmatite. Evidence of shock metamorphism is also present in the form of planar deformation features (PDFs),  horse-tail  shatter fractures, and shatter cones. The Yarrabubba Monzogranite yielded a crystallization age of c. 2650 Ma.","The Yarrabubba Monzogranite outcrops in a demagnetized zone, 20 km wide and 55 km long. It is interpreted to be approximately coincident with the central area of the Yarrabubba meteorite crater, about 70 km southeast of Meekatharra on NOWTHANNA. The main exposure is roughly 13 km long and on average 3 km wide, although a few small scattered outcrops are present to the south.","The Yarrabubba Monzogranite was named after the Yarrabubba meteorite impact crater in which it is situated. It has previously also been referred to as the Yarrabubba Granite (Cassidy et al., 2002).",,"The Yarrabubba Monzogranite is a pale pink, medium- to coarse-grained muscovite-albite monzogranite with local patches of muscovite-bearing pegmatite. The regional biotite monzogranite was hydrothermally altered with the formation of muscovite after biotite, and albite after oligoclase during the meteorite impact event.   The quartz crystals are commonly rounded or amoeboid-shaped. Some crystals contain microscopic planar deformation features (PDFs) that consist of multiple sets of very narrow, closely-spaced (typically <10 &micro;m) parallel layers of glassy material produced by extreme shock metamorphism (Bunting, 2007). The plagioclase shows lamellar twinning and the cleavage planes of the muscovite mica are bent or disrupted.   The rock also contains veins of quartz, pseudotachylite, and coarse-grained, muscovite-bearing pegmatite, which are typically located along faults. The pseudotachylite veins were formed by intense frictional melting when the meteorite impact crater was originally excavated (MacDonald et al., 2003). They are composed of glassy recrystallized rock and typically vary in thickness, colour, and composition. In the northern part of the intrusive body, the veins are usually only a few millimetres thick and very black and glassy. Elsewhere they are composed of a pale green, aphanitic, intensely altered felsic rock up to several tens of millimetres thick. Xenoliths of the Yarrabubba Monzogranite are present within the veins, supporting an impact origin for the pseudotachylite. The pegmatite veins are generally larger and thicker than the pseudotachylite, and are coarser grained than the Yarrabubba Monzogranite.   A small number of shatter cones are present within the Yarrabubba Monzogranite. These range in size from 10 to 50 cm (Macdonald et al., 2003), with their cone apices pointing upwards, indicating they are most likely to have originated from far below the impact location.  Horse-tail  shatter fractures are common and are preserved on the surface of the shatter cones, forming a fan-like pattern radiating out from a central apex.",,,,,"The Yarrabubba Monzogranite intrudes the gneissic biotite metamonzogranite of the Big Bell Suite (A-SDB-mgms).

2962,20942,P_-ETy-sz,2955,Yelma Formation,1,"Sandstone, siltstone, and shale; minor conglomerate and dolomite (locally stromatolitic)","The Yelma Formation consists of fine- to coarse-grained sandstone, shale, carbonate, and minor siltstone and conglomerate. Glauconite grains are common within finer grained sandstones. The formation records a regional marine transgression after localized fluvial deposition. A stromatolitic carbonate facies in the south and west of the basin was differentiated as the Sweetwaters Well Member, but is now excised and raised to formation status within the Tooloo Group. Basal conglomerates are present locally, one of which in the westernmost Earaheedy Basin adjacent to the Marymia Inlier is named the Yadgimurin Member. The formation is thickest in the northwest of the basin, on METHWIN and FAIRBAIRN, where fluvial and alluvial fan facies are present. The Imbin quartz-feldspar porphyry (~1990 Ma) is now interpreted as a volcanic-subvolcanic centre within the lower Yelma Formation, and thin volcaniclastic horizons have been found in the partly correlative Sweetwaters Well Dolomite, but not in the Yelma Formation.   There are detrital zircons ages as young as about 1971 Ma from the Yelma Formation in the central northern part of the basin, but the stratigraphic position of these samples within the formation is uncertain, so the base could be older. Ages as young as 1949 Ma have been determined from zircon-bearing micro-tuffs near the top of the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite, which overlies and may grade laterally into the upper Yelma Formation. Because micro-tuffs in the Frere Formation less than 50 m stratigraphically above these samples have been dated at ~1890 Ma, a hiatus is probable. A sharp contact separates the Frere Formation from the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite in drillcore, but cannot be seen in outcrop. The Yelma Formation and Sweetwaters Well Dolomite are the only units in the Earaheedy Basin succession to return ages indicative of association with the Glenburgh Orogeny. MVT mineralization, although younger at 1811 Ma, is also restricted to these units.","The Yelma Formation is the basal unit of the Earaheedy Basin. It extends along the all but the eastern margin of the basin (which is covered by younger rocks), and is preserved in scattered outliers on Archean basement. The zone of outcrop is much wider along the deformed northern margin of the basin, in part due to structural repetition but also due to interpreted greater deposited thickness.  The thickness of the Yelma Formation ranges from 3 m in the southeast, through 150 m in the type area (Hall et al., 1977). Bunting (1986) estimated a thickness of 1500 m in the deformed northern portion of the basin (north of the Lee Steere Range and its westward continuation onto NABBERU 1:250 000 sheet), but we interpret this as due, in part, to structural repetition.  To the west, the Yelma Formation is inferred to grade laterally into and extend beneath the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite, which thickens relatively abruptly west of Lake Teague and the Shoemaker structure.","The Yelma Formation (Hall et al., 1977) is named after the abandoned Yelma outstation, which in turn was presumably named after Yelma Soak. Both lie in the northern part of YELMA, near the Wiluna-Wongawol road. The type section is on WONGAWOL, 6 km north northwest of the outstation and 6.5 east of Granite Bore, between 367200E 7069600N and 367200E 7071400N, over a low escarpment in low rubbly outcrop, and is 150 m thick (Bunting, 1986).  The upper contact with the Frere Formation in outcrop is marked by the first major occurrence of chert or granular iron-formation (Bunting, 1986), although in places stromatolitic forms persist between granular iron beds for up to 5-6 m above the contact (e.g. drillhole TDH 26; 265505E 7166696N).  Two members were recognised within the Yelma Formation, the conglomeratic Yadgimurrin Member at the base in the west, and a stromatolitic carbonate, the Sweetwaters Well Member (named by Pirajno and Adamides, 1998; defined by Hocking et al., 2000), at the top along the southern basin margin and in the west in drillcore and oiutcrop. The Sweetwaters Well Member is now given formation status, as Sweetwaters Well Dolomite (Occhipinti et al., 2017). It and the Yelma Formation form the Tooloo Group, as the Frere Formation has been excised from the group after recognition of a probable significant hiatus between it and underlying units (Sheppard et al, 2016; Occhipinti et al., 2017).  The Yelma Formation is shown on previous mapsheets as  P_Ey .  ",,"The Yelma Formation was described in detail by Hall and Goode (1978) and Bunting (1986), and later by Pirajno et al. (2009). It consists of sandstone, shale, siltstone and conglomerate, and some carbonate (now mostly dolomite and chert). Glauconite grains are common except in the coarser grained parts of the formation that are interpreted as continental deposits. The formation is quite variable laterally and vertically in both thickness and composition. Sandstone ( P_ETy-st ), siltstone and shale ( P_ETy-sl ), and detrital limestone ( P_ETy-k ) can be differentiated in places at mappable scales. A basal coarse-grained sandstone to pebbly conglomerate is common, and thick texturally immature (conglomerate and pebbly sandstone) intervals are present in the northwest, aound the Carnarvon Ranges on METHWIN. Along the northern limb of the broad syncline that forms the exposed Earaheedy Basin, the formation is commonly dynamically metamorphosed (on LEE STEERE, RHODES, METHWIN, and FAIRBAIRN), sufficiently so that a separate unit ( P_ETy-xml-mt ) has been differentiated on some mapsheets. Sandstone beds in the southeast are trough cross-bedded, with local asymmetric ripples and mudcracks. Scattered stellate pseudomorphs on WONGAWOL may be after evaporitic minerals (Jones, 2004). A localised conglomeratic unit, the Yadgimurin Member ( P_ETyy-sg ), has been recognized at the base of the Yelma Formation in the westernmost Earaheedy Basin. The 100 to 400 m thick stromatolitic dolomite and chert in the southwest and west of the basin previously assigned to the Sweetwaters Well Member of the Yelma Formation, is now given formation status within the Tooloo Group, as the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite.  The type section on WONGAWOL consists of, from the base upwards, about 4 m of medium- to coarse-grained sandstone, which commonly contains varying proportions of pebble-sized clasts of subangular to subrounded vein quartz, unconformably overlying Archaean granitic rocks, interbedded with thin (<5 cm) siltstone and mudstone beds. This is overlain by about 50 m of interbedded medium- to fine-grained sandstone, shale, siltstone, and mudstone. The upper part of the type section is about 100 m thick, and consists of thinly bedded siltstone, mudstone, and shale. The basal medium- to coarse-grained sandstone contains asymmetrical and symmetrical ripple marks, trough cross-bedding, shrinkage textures, and small stellate pseudomorphs after ?gypsum. Sandstone beds are up to 1 m thick but are generally about 50 cm in thickness. Sandstone-dominated units in the overlying interbedded sandstone, shale, siltstone, and mudstone interval are typically less than 1 m thick, and individual beds are commonly less than 20 cm thick. Shale, siltstone, and mudstone in the upper part of the Yelma Formation become progressively more iron-rich towards the contact with the Frere Formation. This upper package is similar to shale, siltstone, and mudstone horizons in the Frere Formation, and was originally considered to be part of the Frere Formation (Hall et al., 1977). Bunting (1986) revised the definition for the lower contact of the Frere Formation with the Yelma Formation, and placed the upper shale, siltstone, and mudstone package in the Yelma Formation.  The Yelma Formation occupies much of the northeastern portion of THADUNA in the westernmost Earaheedy Basin, near and around Lake Gregory, where it consists mainly of quartz arenite. Stromatolitic dolomite and chert breccia previously included in the formation (Pirajno et al., 2009) is now largely assigned to the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite. The base of the Yelma Formation is exposed 1.5 km east of Freshwater Well, on the southern edge of Lake Gregory. Here, quartz lithic sandstone and quartz conglomerate lie unconformably on quartz arenite of the Finlayson Member of the Juderina Formation (Yerrida Basin).   In the area around Edingunna Spring (MARYMIA), dolomite and chert breccia now considered part of the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite overlies pebble beds, about 2 m thick, comprising subrounded to rounded pebbles up to 5 cm in diameter, dominantly of quartz and chert, and a coarse-grained, poorly sorted quartz (and feldspathic) arenite. These are probably the base of the Yelma Formation and may correlate with the Yadgimurrin Member. ","The Yelma Formation was deposited in a fluvial to coastal setting. Limited palaeocurrent data for the Yelma Formation on WONGAWOL suggest that sediment transport was towards the north-northwest (Jones 2004). The formation records a marine transgression over the Yilgarn Craton, after localised fluvial deposition, typical of the basal unit of a passive-margin basin. This is confirmed by the presence of glauconite in much of the unit. Sedimentary structures suggest evaporitic conditions locally at the base of the Yelma Formation. The upper Yelma Formation developed in quiet water conditions and may reflect deposition in a lagoonal environment developed behind a carbonate bank, represented by the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite. The detrital zircon populations are dominantly 2.6-2.7 Ga in age, with a smaller 2.2 Ga population, and minor 2.0 Ga zircons that are not known from higher in the Earaheedy Basin succession (Sheppard et al., 2016; Occhipinti et al., 2017). These and the paleocurrent data suggest the Yilgarn Craton and southern Gascoyne Province were important sediment sources during basin development. On METHWIN, facies trends suggest a northwesterly provenance rather than the dominantly southern provenance of the Yilgarn Craton (Hocking and Jones, 2004) which detrital zircon populations suggest further south and east.",3,1000,,"The Yelma Formation is unconformable on crystalline and greenstone rocks of the Yilgarn Craton. It is overlain conformably by, and grades laterally into, the Sweetwaters Well Dolomite. The Frere Formation is disconformable on the Yelma Formation, rather than conformable as was previously thought - the relationship can only be discerned in drill core and even then might be not apparent without detailed precise geochronological sampling.",,17,,,,4,,,,1990,9,1949,10,"The maximum age of the Yelma Formation is constrained by the age of the Imbin quartz-feldspar porphry, dated at 1990 +/- 6 Ma by Nelson (2001), and now interpreted as equivalent to part of the lower Yelma Formation (Sheppard et al., 2016, Occhipinti et al., 2017). This is marginally older than a detrital zircon U-Pb age of 1983 +/- 51 Ma (Halilovic et al., 2004) from the basal Yelma Formation. A detrital zircon age of 2027 +/- 23 Ma has been cited for the Yelma Formation in the past (Pirajno et al., 2009), but this sample was stated to be from Frere Formation by Nelson (1997).  Matonia (2009) described a group of detrital zircons with an age range of 2000 - 1970 Ma, in which the youngest grain was 1971 +/- 26 Ma, from two samples from an area of deformed Yelma Formation on south central RHODES. Although described as basal Yelma Formation by Matonia, their stratigraphic position within the Yelma Formation is here assessed as uncertain. These may have been sourced from a volcanic centre associated with the Imbin porphyry (Sheppard et al., 2016). This centre may have been related to magmatism in the Glenburgh Terrane of the Gascoyne Province, specifically the Dalgaringa Supersuite and Nardoo Granite (Matonia, 2009), as the 2000 - 1970 Ma zircons are the only  zircons in the Earaheedy Basin succession of a comparable age and hafnium isotopic composition. This indicates a pronounced change in provenance between the Yelma and Frere Formations, and reinforces the concept of a hiatus at the base of the Frere Formation.  Muhling et al. (2012) provided a firm minimum depositional age of 1811 +/- 13 Ma for the Yelma Formation, from authigenic monazite, but Sheppard et al. (2016) later suggested that this might reflect fluid flow during deformation of the entire Earaheedy Basin succession rather than just the Yelma Formation. They favoured an age of 1949 +/- 10 Ma from thin tuffaceous layers in drill core from the uppermost &quot;Yelma Formation&quot; (here regarded as Sweetwaters Well Dolomite) as a minimum age constraint. Supporting this, Rasmussen et al. (2012) dated tuffaceous material in the immediately overlying basal Frere Formation as 1891 +/- 8 Ma.  Halilovic et al. (2004) obtained dates as young as 1983 +/- 51 Ma from detrital zircons in the Yelma Formation. Sheppard et al. (2016) raised doubts as to the validity of this data and interpretation, presented ages of about 1970 Ma from micro-tuff beds in the uppermost Sweetwaters Well Dolomite, and proposed a hiatus of 50 to 80 Ma duration separated the it from the Frere Formation, as micro-tuffs low in the latter have an age of c. 1890 Ma (Rasmussen et al., 2012).  The 1653 +/- 14.4 Ma age, from metamorphic mica in schist in dynamically metamorphosed Tooloo Group (Pirajno et al., 2009), previously considered a minimum constraint, is here attributed to deformation associated with formation of the Scorpion and Edmund Basins.",No,,,2,,No,DE in Progress,No,Yes,P_,ETy,,,,,MIGSDRH,2.02E+13,,No,No

They have a maximum thickness of about 80 m and comprise quartz-feldspar-muscovite schist, psammitic schist, and weakly foliated, very low-grade metasandstone and metasiltstone. Schistose rocks were derived from a sandstone and siltstone protolith and all rock types are cut by a shallowly dipping, weak to strong foliation that is generally subparallel to the sedimentary bedding. Lithological changes in the sedimentary rock protolith suggest this unit evolved from a subaerial fluvial setting to a shallow-marine depositional environment. Rocks assigned to P_-MEy-mts have not been dated directly.

Contacts between these rock types are transitional and indicate that the schists were also derived from a sandstone and siltstone protolith. The unit shows an overall upward-fining grain-size distribution, with metasiltstones being more abundant in upper parts of the succession. Disseminated, fine-grained magnetite is common throughout the unit.  The schists, metasedimentary rocks, and the unconformably underlying granite are cut by a shallowly dipping muscovite-grade foliation that is mostly subparallel with, or shallowly inclined to, the gently domically folded sedimentary bedding. Small-scale kink folds are also observed within finer grained beds. The foliation is not pervasive throughout the unit, but instead appears to have a large-scale, anastomosing distribution. It also becomes weaker when traced upwards through the succession, which has a transitional, conformable contact with the overlying Irregully Formation.   Very low-grade metasandstones are thinly to very thickly bedded and fine to very coarse grained. Feldspathic lithic sandstones dominate in lower parts of the succession, whereas those in upper levels are more quartz rich. Strongly flattened mudstone clasts are also abundant in many of the coarser grained beds. Most sandstones in the lower part of the unit are medium- to very thick-bedded and either massive or subhorizontally stratified. Middle and upper levels contain thin- to medium-bedded, fine- to coarse-grained sandstone and may display parallel-planar lamination or ripple cross-lamination. Straight-crested ripple bedforms are also preserved on some bedding surfaces.","Interpretation of the overall depositional environment is hampered by the poor preservation of sedimentary structures in the lower and middle parts of the unit. Here, the erosive relationship with the underlying granite, immature, arkosic composition and the coarse-grained, thickly bedded nature of the metasandstones suggests they may have been deposited in a subaerial fluvial setting. In contrast, upper parts of the unit are fine to coarse grained and are compositionally more mature than the underlying sandstones. Together with the preservation of probable wave ripple bedforms, the presence of increased amounts of interbedded siltstone indicates deposition in a shallow-marine environment. The proposed evolution from a subaerial fluvial setting to a shallow-marine depositional environment is similar to that proposed for the Yilgatherra Formation parent (P_-MEy-st) elsewhere in the Edmund Basin.",,80,,"The low-grade metasedimentary rocks unconformably overlie medium-grained, even-textured biotite granite belonging to the 1820-1775 Ma Moorarie Supersuite of the Gascoyne Province (Sheppard et al., 2010).

4804,74842,A-ANyo-xony-am,571,Youanmi Igneous Complex,1,Layered gabbro and leucogabbro with magnetitite and pyroxenite layers; metamorphosed,"The Youanmi Igneous Complex is the second largest of the layered intrusions of the Meeline Suite, Annean Supersuite. It is located within a 20 km radius (mainly west) of the Youanmi townsite (Zone 50, MGA 678722E 6833455N) in the central Youanmi Terrane, western Yilgarn Craton. The outcrop is approximately 35 km north-south and 16 km east-west, and has been deformed into the Youanmi Shear Zone in the south. It contains four zones of layered igneous stratigraphy, and an unlayered border zone. Geophysical modelling indicates that each of the layered zones is about 1.5 km thick, broadly conformable and inward-dipping at shallow to moderate angles, forming an overall tabular-shaped intrusion. The body is highly irregular at its margins due to overlying felsic volcanics, shear zones, and crosscutting granitic plutons. The ultramafic zone and lower zone have a relatively high proportion of ultramafic cumulate rocks compared to the middle and the upper zones, which are dominated by gabbroic and magnetite-bearing leucogabbroic orthocumulate rocks. The border zone is dominantly dolerite and the lower part of the upper zone is host to significant thicknesses of magnetitite, which have been explored for V-Ti mineralization.","The Youanmi Igneous Complex outcrops as an irregular, ovoid, approximately 35 km north-south and 16 km east-west body, but it extends up to 20 km farther south where it is sheared along the Youanmi Shear Zone. The outcrop of the complex is approximately 330 km&sup2; and located within a 20 km radius (mainly west) of the historic Youanmi townsite (Zone 50, MGA 678735E 6833085N) on central YOUANMI.   The complex lies 10 km southeast of the Windimurra Igneous Complex (A-ANwi-xony-am), 32 km northeast of the Narndee Igneous Complex (A-ANna-xony-any), and 15 km southwest of the Atley Igneous Complex (A-ANat-xony-am). ","The Youanmi Igneous Complex of the Meeline Suite (A-ANM-xony-amy) was described in Ivanic et al. (2010). It is named after the historic Youanmi townsite (Zone 50, MGA 679368E 6833753N). Previous mapping called it the 'Youanmi intrusion' and did not differentiate the intrusion into zones (e.g. Stewart et al., 1979).  The type area for the complex is in the vicinity of the contact between layered gabbroic rocks of the middle zone to the northeast and the doleritic border zone to the southwest (TJIYOU100063, Zone 50, MGA 664526E 6818428N). This lies about 150 m northeast of a geochronology sample site within the border zone (GSWA 194751, CLKWIN090005, Zone 50, MGA 664389E 6818338N). A traverse of one kilometre to the northeast passes through cyclical layering of leucogabbro, gabbro and melagabbro, and minor pyroxenite of the lower part of the middle zone. Farther east, around Freddies Well magnetite-bearing gabbros of the upper part of the middle zone are dominant. Farther east, over about one kilometre, a continuous series of exposures show abundant, thick magnetitites of the upper zone. ",,"The Youanmi Igneous Complex is divided into five zones based on mineralogy and lithological characteristics as follows. (1) The border zone (A-ANyb-od, the only unlayered zone of the complex) consists of dolerite with lesser metadolerite, gabbro and metagabbro. (2) An ultramafic zone (A-ANyu-xap-ax), which is not seen in outcrop, is interpreted, based on gravity data and by analogy with ultramafic zones elsewhere in the Meeline Suite, to be composed of interlayered pyroxenite and peridotite cumulate rocks, which may contain horizons of chromitite. (3) The lower zone (A-ANyl-xogx-mat) comprises modally layered, pyroxene-rich gabbro interlayered with pyroxenite and serpentinite (after peridotitic cumulate igneous layers). (4) The middle zone (A-ANym-xom-og) is dominantly gabbro interlayered with gabbronorite and lesser melagabbro, leucogabbro and pyroxenite. All lithologies contain local intercumulus magnetite. (5) The upper zone (A-ANyz-xam-ogl) is dominantly magnetitite interlayered with leucogabbro, with lesser gabbro, gabbronorite and anorthosite. The gabbroic lithologies are locally magnetite rich, or contain minor magnetite or ilmenite. Although not recorded, fayalitic olivine and apatite are probably present as accessory phases. A layer of hornblende gabbro (A-ANyz-oh) within the upper zone has 8-15 mm hornblende oikocrysts in medium-grained, gabbroic matrix (TJIYOU100027, Zone 50, MGA 668131E 6830687N). Unassigned sheared and metamorphosed areas of the complex are mapped at its southern and northern extremities (A-ANyo-masr; A-AN-yo-moga).  Layering is typically on a decimetre to decametre vertical scale. On a large scale, layering observed in the contiguous parts of the complex (i.e. the middle and upper zones) are concentrically arranged and inward dipping at 15-45&deg;. From geophysical modelling, the overall form of the complex is tabular, and the individual layered zones form conformable, stacked, saucer shapes within the larger intrusion (Ivanic et al., 2017).  Gabbros and dolerites of the border zone have typically subophitic textures. The layered zones are dominantly orthocumulates with 4-10 mm plagioclase cumulate crystals and oikocrystic clinopyroxene up to 20 mm across. Adcumulate to mesocumulate ultramafic lithologies are also present and several layers of pegmatitic gabbro have been identified (e.g. TJIYOU100063, Zone 50, MGA 664526E 6818428N). Olivine cumulate texture is locally preserved in ultramafic rocks of the lower zone (e.g. TJIYOU100045, Zone 50, MGA 674466E 6811674N).  Limited whole rock chemistry (including data from Gill, 2011) from the middle and upper zones reveals variation in MgO from 3-13 wt %, CaO 1-14 wt %, TiO 2  <15 wt %. Locally elevated Pt, Cr and Ni correspond to minor olivine-bearing rocks. Strong iron-enrichment trends in upper zone rocks (Gill, 2011) are interpreted to indicate tholeiitic affinity. Whole-rock rare earth element profiles are typically low and flat at around four times chondritic values.  Mineral chemistry on a single olivine-bearing sample from the upper zone (Gill, 2011) showed a forsterite content of approximately Fo 65 . Plagioclase from a wider array of samples varies from An 61  to An 68 . Clinopyroxene Mg# varies from 74 to 78. Magnetite typically has 0.5-1.5 wt% Cr 2 O 3  with local spikes up to 4 wt%. ",,,,,"The Youanmi Igneous Complex intrudes metasedimentary rocks of the Norie Group. The best exposed contacts are in the south where the doleritic border zone outcrops between middle zone gabbros and sheared supracrustal rocks with a steeply dipping contact (dipping approximately 80&deg; inwards towards the middle of the complex). Recrystallization in rafts of psammite, quartzite and banded iron-formation within the border zone (e.g. TJIYOU100070, Zone 50, MGA 664456E 6818147N) is interpreted to be the result of contact metamorphism from intrusion of this zone, and the complex as a whole. Sheared contacts between the complex and Norie Group supracrustal rocks can be seen in places (e.g. TJIYOU100077, Zone 50, MGA 663143E 6819141N).   The upper contact of the complex is not exposed (i.e. the upper part of the upper zone) but it probably has an intrusive contact with the Youangarra Volcanics Member of the Yaloginda Formation, which is distinctly recrystallized in the region (e.g. TJIYOU110173, Zone 50, MGA 673561E 6821152N). In places, the contact has been intruded by quartz veins (e.g. TJIYOU1100005, Zone 50, MGA 675999E 6830898N).  Aplite dykes of the Mount Kenneth Suite intruded the upper zone of the complex at 2800 Â± 11 Ma (YMDD002-70: Gill, 2011; drillhole location is Zone 50, MGA 673574E 6833765N). Metamonzogranites of the Tuckanarra Suite (A-TU-mgss) are in sheared contact with the lower zone along the Youanmi Shear Zone. Walganna Suite granites (e.g. A-BRG-xgm-gp; A-BRwa-gmv) intruded the southern, western and northern margins of the complex. Associated Li-rich pegmatites crosscut layers of the border zone of the complex (e.g. at site TJIYOU100070, Zone 50, MGA 664456E 6818147N). Proterozoic dykes are observed to cut across all parts of the complex (e.g. P_-MMU-od).

The lithology is dominated by magnetitite layers interlayered with magnetite-bearing leucogabbro, with lesser gabbro, gabbronorite, anorthosite, and pegmatitic gabbro, which are typically interlayered on a 1-5 m vertical scale, and cyclically layered on a 0.2 m vertical scale locally.","The upper zone of the Youanmi Igneous Complex lies in the central-eastern part of the complex in an ovoid area about 22.5 km long and 8 km wide on central YOUANMI. It comprises about 50% of the surface expression of the complex. Gravity data (Ivanic et al., 2017) indicate that the upper zone extends down to a depth of approximately 1.5 km below the surface, which is a minimum estimate for its true thickness. It is best exposed in an area about 3 km southwest of Town Well (Zone 50, MGA 677823E 6835009N).","The upper zone of the Youanmi Igneous Complex was first named and described briefly in Ivanic et al. (2010). It is similar to the upper zone (A-ANwz-xoml-am) of the Windimurra Igneous Complex in its lithological constituents.  The type area is about 3 km southwest of Town Well (Zone 50, MGA 677823E 6835009N), where there are abundant examples of cyclical modal layering of magnetitites and gabbroic rocks. At a larger scale, a continuation of the traverse for the type section for the middle zone (A-ANwm-xom-og), a traverse from west to east over 1 km, starts 250 m east of Freddies Well (Zone 50, MGA 666289E 6819008N). Here, a continuous series of exposures show abundant, thick magnetitites interlayered with leucogabbro of the upper zone overlying dominantly gabbroic rocks of the middle zone.",,"The upper zone is dominantly magnetitite interlayered with leucogabbro, with lesser gabbro, gabbronorite, and anorthosite. Gabbroic lithologies are locally magnetite-rich or contain magnetite or ilmenite. Minor fayalitic olivine and apatite, although not recorded, are probably present as accessory phases. A layer of hornblende gabbro (A-ANyz-oh) contains 8-15 mm-long hornblende oikocrysts in a medium-grained gabbroic matrix (TJIYOU100027, Zone 50, MGA 668131E 6830687N). Lithology varies cyclically over 0.2-20 m thickness intervals (e.g. 0.2 m cyclicity at TJIWIN000181, Zone 50, MGA 673998E 6833727N). Layers are concentrically arranged and inward dipping at an average of 10&deg;, forming a shallow saucer shape.  The rocks of the upper zone are dominantly orthocumulates with 4-20 mm magnetite, ilmenite, and plagioclase cumulate crystals and interstitial, locally oikocrystic pyroxene ( and rare hornblende) crystals up to 30 mm across.   Whole-rock chemistry by Gill (2011) shows variation in MgO from 3 to 11 wt%, CaO 1-12 wt%, and TiO2 at <15 wt%. Strong iron enrichment trends are noted on an AFM diagram (Gill, 2011), which are interpreted to indicate tholeiitic affinity. Whole-rock rare earth element profiles are typically low and flat at around four times of the chondritic values.  Mineral chemistry by Gill (2011) on a single olivine-bearing sample indicated a forsterite content of approximately Fo65. Plagioclase from a wider array of samples varies from An61 to An68. Clinopyroxene Mg# varies from 74 to 78. Magnetite typically has 0.5-1.5 wt% Cr2O3, but with local spikes of up to 4 wt%.",,,,,"The upper zone of the Youanmi Igneous Complex is interpreted to be the last zone of cumulate lithologies to have accumulated in the complex. It conformably overlies cumulates of the middle zone, which, based on geophysical data, is also interpreted to be present beneath the whole of the upper zone.

However, there are no direct dates from the lower part of the stratigraphy, which is therefore unconstrained in age. The maximum age constrain for greenstones in the Southern Cross Domain is provided by a c. 3130 Ma maximum depositional age for quartzites farther to the north (Wyche et al., 2004), and this is therefore considered the maximum age for this unit as well.

The monzogranite has sheared contacts with the surrounding greenstones, and appears to be intruded by a feldspar porphyritic monzogranite. The Ziggy Monzogranite is generally medium-grained and seriate-textured, although it is locally coarse-grained, equigranular and porphyritic. The rock has a variably developed solid-state foliation and stretching lineation. ","The Ziggy Monzogranite crops out in the western Dorothy Hills.

The rock generally has 3-4 millimetre long, subhedral, tabular feldspars in a medium-grained groundmass of feldspar and quartz, with millimetre scale biotite aggregates. The monzogranite is locally equigranular and porphyritic, with some outcrops containing scattered 6 mm long feldspar phenocrysts (MJPDHS000125). The monzogranite generally has a weak to moderate solid state foliation that is locally strong, particularly near the contacts with the greenstones. Locally, the rock has a moderately developed stretching lineation, defined by quartz aggregates. The rock locally contains a series of quartz veins that are 1 centimetre wide and up to 30 centimetres long (MJPDHS000126). These veins are at a high angle to the solid-state foliation, and contain a well developed stretching lineation. The unit is locally very weathered.
