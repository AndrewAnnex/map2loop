M2L thoughts

General to do
1. XxxAdd fault dimensions to read me, classify
2. XxxFunctionise plugs, wkt, parfile, tidy
3. XxxAdd parse fault relationships
4. Thickness no faults
5. Thickness no intervening layers and bigger search radius
6. XxxTidy up all in one to reduce duplications
7. XxxReproject lat long from dst_srs
8. Priors all in one place
9. XxxAdd formation thickness to all in one? No
10. Sills. Can be inter or intra. 
11. Plutons: are they working?!
12. Add polarity code to orientations 
13. Filter faults by size?
14. Calculate offsets?
15. Calculate fold wavelengths, amplitudes?
16. Expose all file names in functions
17. Labelled list of codes and labels or function?
18. Labelled list of filenames and paths? or￼ function?
19. Code/group = formation/series
20. Cope with warox naming conventions and add to geoserver
21. Search all warox layers for points and combine
22. Get all warox layers
23. Extended topology to reduce uncertainty (group, intragroup)
24. If gempy else geomodeller else loopstructural else surfe just after tidy
25. Xxxfeature/FEATURE vs [‘fcode’] ?
26. XxxLocal store dtm for example in dtm 
27. Analysis folder (interpolations, thickness etc)?
28. Clip/shp folder? Clipped and basal strat files
29. Rename combo_full
30. XxxStandardise filenames (hams or probs not)
31. Contacts4 etc clean up filenames
32. Use roi file as input?
33. Redo groups as clean tables cols = one possible topological sort after transpose
34. Why is combo saved?
35. Read_raster and read_vector wrappers
36. Save row of csv wrapper or just make lists? Ostr 
37. Interpolate using contacts and points outside box?
38. Documentation!!
39. XxxGeopandas Hawaii
40. Topology as falsifier. Pluton vs fault example
41. Clever: topology. Contact interpolation. Basal contacts. Thickness maps. Tidy. 
42. Analyse interpolation orientations for structure (saddles, domes, etc))
43. Erode vs onlap via go vs gp topology
44. XxxMake test data, data and graph paths if needed
45. Use stratigraphic offsets across faults to filter big throw combined with estimated thickness!!
46. XxxRemanence tomofastx
47. Need unique codes for geol,structure,faults
48. Templates for specific databases or map sets 
49. 3D potential fields with grav/mag Mahtab
50. Preprocessor notebook with widgets for codes and labels
51. Save out fm level summary thickness stats


Better models
1. Supergroup similar groups
2. Keep groups but duplicate orientation data
3. Add extra true contacts 
4. Add extra interpolated orientations 
5. Fix topology errors
6. Do high resolution interpolations but only pass a subset?

Tidy

1. Every series needs a formation
2. every formation needs two contacts
3. Every series needs an orientation 
4. No orientations that don’t belong to a formation
5. No formations that don’t belong to series

Natural language conceptual priors:

Zero level. Individual observation 
This is bedding
That is a granite
This is a fault contact
This unit unconformably overlays that one

First level: specific group behaviour
Faults dip to east
NS faults younger
Plutons are pancakes
The folds in the turbidites have chevron geometries 
This fault is listric


Second level: ensemble
This is a fold and thrust terrane
These are refolded folds
This is an inverted basin
This is a greenstone belt 
This is a core complex

Elevator pitch

The international Loop Consortium led by Laurent Ailleres at Monash University has joined forces with the MinEx CRC project on Automated 3D geological modelling led by Mark’s Jessell & Lindsay at UWA to launch a new Open Source initiative to drive innovation in 3D geomodelling. This builds on the many years of work carried out by these and other groups highlighted in this slide.

Loop: better world for 3D modellers
MinEx 1: week for uncertainty-charactetised model suites
DARE: Cohort of natural data scientists
DECRA: what data for all this?

Full MinEx:

Life-of-Project Performance Target for Project 6: Reduce to one week the time taken from receiving data to constructing probabilistic models at the mine scale. 

Status: We can make a first-pass model now in 10 minutes, without code optimisation. We have 6 days, 23 hours and 50 minutes worth of computation time and 8 years of development time to improve our models and still meet our time target.
