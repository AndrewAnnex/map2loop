M2L thoughts

General to do

4. Thickness no faults
5. Thickness no intervening layers and bigger search radius
8. Priors all in one place
10. Sills. Can be inter or intra. 
12. Add polarity code to orientations 
13. Filter faults by size?
14. Calculate offsets?
15. Calculate fold wavelengths, amplitudes?
16. Expose all file names in functions
18. Labelled list of filenames and paths? or￼ function?
19. Code/group = formation/series
20. Cope with warox naming conventions and add to geoserver
21. Search all warox layers for points and combine
22. Get all warox layers
23. Extended topology to reduce uncertainty (group, intragroup)
24. If gempy else geomodeller else loopstructural else surfe just after tidy
27. Analysis folder (interpolations, thickness etc)?
28. Clip/shp folder? Clipped and basal strat files
29. Rename combo_full
31. Contacts4 etc clean up filenames
32. Use roi file as input?
34. Why is combo saved?
35. Read_raster and read_vector wrappers
36. Save row of csv wrapper or just make lists? Ostr 
37. Interpolate using contacts and points outside box?
38. Documentation!!
40. Topology as falsifier. Pluton vs fault example
41. Clever: topology. Contact interpolation. Basal contacts. Thickness maps. Tidy. 
42. Analyse interpolation orientations for structure (saddles, domes, etc))
43. Erode vs onlap via go vs gp topology
45. Use stratigraphic offsets across faults to filter big throw combined with estimated thickness!!
48. Templates for specific databases or map sets: URI; field names; field values; dictionaries
52. Extra interpolation helps GemPy, geomodeller not so much
54. Fix geomodeller notebook (doesn't load properly, plus dead groups from igneous shouldn't be loaded)
55. Fix Proper gempy notebook (crashes)
59. Supergroup lists for structural coherence
60. Make fault-fault graph to hunt for cycles in DAG and remove shortest one or just remove truncation?
61. How to ensure contacts are present in all fault domains


1. XxxAdd fault dimensions to read me, classify
2. XxxFunctionise plugs, wkt, parfile, tidy
3. XxxAdd parse fault relationships
6. XxxTidy up all in one to reduce duplications
7. XxxReproject lat long from dst_srs
9. XxxAdd formation thickness to all in one? No
11. Xxx Plutons: are they working?!
17. XxxLabelled list of codes and labels or function?
25. Xxxfeature/FEATURE vs [‘fcode’] ?
26. XxxLocal store dtm for example in dtm 
30. XxxStandardise filenames (hams or probs not)
39. XxxGeopandas Hawaii
44. XxxMake test data, data and graph paths if needed
46. XxxRemanence tomofastx
47. XxxNeed unique codes for geol,structure,faults
49. Xxx3D potential fields with grav/mag Mahtab
50. XxxPreprocessor notebook with widgets for codes and labels
51. XxxSave out fm level summary thickness stats
53. XxxRedo groups as simple arrays
33. XxxRedo groups as clean tables cols = one possible topological sort after transpose
56. Xxx Is there a way to feed empty domains? Maybe just add orientation points either side of every fault mid-point, contact points should be OK? 
57. Xxx Get Lachie's notebook for map2LoopStructural
58. Xxx Filter faults, fault relationships on dimensions/throw prior to saving to csv. Add Fault_ to fault names everywhere 

Mahtab
1. 3D potential field extrapolation
2. Graph cut training from seismic applied to regional grav/mag
3. Topology as constraint 

Nuwan
1:Test GPT
2: SimPEG/ loop?
3: uncertainty in 1D from Loop/cure applied as constraint on full 3D

Better models
1. Supergroup similar groups
2. Keep groups but duplicate orientation data
3. Add extra true contacts 
4. Add extra interpolated orientations 
5. Fix topology errors
6. Do high resolution interpolations but only pass a subset?

Tidy

1. Every series needs a formation
2. every formation needs two contacts
3. Every series needs an orientation 
4. No orientations that don’t belong to a formation
5. No formations that don’t belong to series

Natural language conceptual priors:

Zero level. Individual observation 
This is bedding
That is a granite
This is a fault contact
This unit unconformably overlays that one

First level: specific group behaviour
Faults dip to east
NS faults younger
Plutons are pancakes
The folds in the turbidites have chevron geometries 
This fault is listric


Second level: ensemble
This is a fold and thrust terrane
These are refolded folds
This is an inverted basin
This is a greenstone belt 
This is a core complex

Elevator pitch

The international Loop Consortium led by Laurent Ailleres at Monash University has joined forces with the MinEx CRC project on Automated 3D geological modelling led by Mark’s Jessell & Lindsay at UWA to launch a new Open Source initiative to drive innovation in 3D geomodelling. This builds on the many years of work carried out by these and other groups highlighted in this slide.

Loop: better world for 3D modellers
MinEx 1: week for uncertainty-charactetised model suites
DARE: Cohort of natural data scientists
DECRA: what data for all this?

Full MinEx:

Life-of-Project Performance Target for Project 6: Reduce to one week the time taken from receiving data to constructing probabilistic models at the mine scale. 

Status: We can make a first-pass model now in 10 minutes, without code optimisation. We have 6 days, 23 hours and 50 minutes worth of computation time and 8 years of development time to improve our models and still meet our time target.
