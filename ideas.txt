M2L thoughts

General to do

Functionality
4. Thickness no faults or fold hinges
5. Thickness no intervening layers and bigger search radius
10. Sills. Can be inter or intra, can have holes (probably ignore holes for now)!. 
12. Add polarity code to orientations 
15. Calculate fold wavelengths, amplitudes?
20. Cope with warox naming conventions and add to geoserver [partially done, added strike possibility vs dip direction]
23. Extended topology to reduce uncertainty (group, intragroup)
42. Analyse interpolation orientations for structure (saddles, domes, etc))
43. Erode vs onlap via gp vs gp topology
45. Use stratigraphic offsets across faults to filter big throw combined with estimated thickness!!
55. Fix Proper gempy notebook (crashes)
59. Supergroup lists for structural coherence
64. Spatial density of info a la Alan? MDL's job? Becki? Tom Cartwright
65. https://epsg.io/28350.prettywkt
66. Filtering of near_fault orientation data (only need one orientation per series)
67. List of data sources for export
68. Filter faults by centrality? (networkx degree_centrality(G) or eigenvector_centrality())
69. Merge colinear fault strings
70. Cut polygons by faults if not edges
71. networkx in/out connectivity for strat analysis
72. Filter out orientations far from contacts?
73. Filter out orientations which are inconsistent with local contact orientations?
74. Calculate dip polarity
75. Fold axial traces to geomodeller fold system
76. DEfine what units are actually intrusive
77. Move clipping upfront so can be used to modify coding (e.g. when multiple layers have same codes)
78. Group age as ultimate ordering control? (done in tidy_data())

Style
8. Priors all in one place
16. Expose all file names in functions?
18. Labelled list of filenames and paths? or function?
19. Code/group = formation/series
21. Search all warox layers for points and combine
27. Analysis folder (interpolations, thickness etc)?
28. Clip/shp folder? Clipped and basal strat files
29. Rename combo_full
31. Contacts4 etc clean up filenames
32. Use roi file as input?
34. Why is combo saved?
35. Read_raster and read_vector wrappers
36. Save row of csv wrapper or just make lists? Ostr 
38. Documentation!!
48. Templates for specific databases or map sets: URI; field names; field values; dictionaries
63. Redo adjacency matrixes using networkx?

Data
22. Get all warox layers
37. Interpolate using contacts and points outside box?

Concepts
40. Topology as falsifier. Pluton vs fault example
41. Clever: topology. Contact interpolation. Basal contacts. Thickness maps. Tidy. 
52. Extra interpolation helps GemPy, geomodeller not so much


Doneish

1. XxxAdd fault dimensions to read me, classify
2. XxxFunctionise plugs, wkt, parfile, tidy
3. XxxAdd parse fault relationships
6. XxxTidy up all in one to reduce duplications
7. XxxReproject lat long from dst_srs
9. XxxAdd formation thickness to all in one? No
11. Xxx Plutons: are they working?!
17. XxxLabelled list of codes and labels or function?
24. Xxx If gempy else geomodeller else loopstructural else surfe just after tidy
25. Xxxfeature/FEATURE vs [‘fcode’] ?
26. XxxLocal store dtm for example in dtm 
30. XxxStandardise filenames (hams or probs not)
39. XxxGeopandas Hawaii
44. XxxMake test data, data and graph paths if needed
46. XxxRemanence tomofastx
47. XxxNeed unique codes for geol,structure,faults
49. Xxx3D potential fields with grav/mag Mahtab
50. XxxPreprocessor notebook with widgets for codes and labels
51. XxxSave out fm level summary thickness stats
53. XxxRedo groups as simple arrays
33. XxxRedo groups as clean tables cols = one possible topological sort after transpose
56. Xxx Is there a way to feed empty domains? Maybe just add orientation points either side of every fault mid-point, contact points should be OK? 
57. Xxx Get Lachie's notebook for map2LoopStructural
58. Xxx Filter faults, fault relationships on dimensions/throw prior to saving to csv. Add Fault_ to fault names everywhere 
60. Xxx Make fault-fault graph to hunt for cycles in DAG and remove shortest one or just remove truncation?
61. xxx How to ensure contacts are present in all fault domains: decimate poly lines from basal contacts shapefile but what if there are no contacts in a fault block!!
62. xxx Reverse fault stops
64. xxx When calculating offset also, for each group, also add orientation. If no change of formation, not sure what to do. 
13. xxx Filter faults by size?
14. xxx Calculate offsets?
65. xxx How to use fold axial traces to constrain interpolations: combine azimuth normal of trace; sign of dip from trace plus low dip?
54. xxx Fix geomodeller notebook (doesn't load properly, plus dead groups from igneous shouldn't be loaded)

Mahtab
1. 3D potential field extrapolation
2. Graph cut training from seismic applied to regional grav/mag
3. Topology as constraint 

Nuwan
1:Test GPT
2: SimPEG/ loop?
3: uncertainty in 1D from Loop/cure applied as constraint on full 3D

Better models
1. Supergroup similar groups
2. Keep groups but duplicate orientation data
3. Add extra true contacts 
4. Add extra interpolated orientations 
5. Fix topology errors
6. Do high resolution interpolations but only pass a subset?

Tidy

1. Every series needs a formation
2. every formation needs two contacts
3. Every series needs an orientation 
4. No orientations that don’t belong to a formation
5. No formations that don’t belong to series

Natural language conceptual priors:

Zero level. Individual observation 
This is bedding
That is a granite
This is a fault contact
This unit unconformably overlays that one

First level: specific group behaviour
Faults dip to east
NS faults younger
Plutons are pancakes
The folds in the turbidites have chevron geometries 
This fault is listric


Second level: ensemble
This is a fold and thrust terrane
These are refolded folds
This is an inverted basin
This is a greenstone belt 
This is a core complex

Elevator pitch

The international Loop Consortium led by Laurent Ailleres at Monash University has joined forces with the MinEx CRC project on Automated 3D geological modelling led by Mark’s Jessell & Lindsay at UWA to launch a new Open Source initiative to drive innovation in 3D geomodelling. This builds on the many years of work carried out by these and other groups highlighted in this slide.

Loop: better world for 3D modellers
MinEx 1: week for uncertainty-charactetised model suites
DARE: Cohort of natural data scientists
DECRA: what data for all this?

Full MinEx:

Life-of-Project Performance Target for Project 6: Reduce to one week the time taken from receiving data to constructing probabilistic models. 

Status: We can make a first-pass model now in 10 minutes, without code optimisation. We have 6 days, 23 hours and 50 minutes worth of computation time and 8 years of development time to improve our models and still meet our time target.
