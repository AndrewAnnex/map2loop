# map2model Package

More to come...

A package to extract information from geological maps to feed 3D modelling packages

What it does:

Inputs: (example data supplied)<br>
Graph from Vitaliy's map2model ArcPlugin (and soon via standalone code)<br>
Geology Polygons<br>
Fault PolyLines<br>
Structure measurements (bed dips)<br>
<br>
Outputs:<br>
Decimated Bed dips as	csv file<br>
Decimated basal contacts of units as csv file<br>
Decimated faults with representative orientation as csv files<br>
Decimated estimated dips on basal contacts<br>
<br>
Does not deal with intrusions yet.<br>
Sample code to feed to gempy, but second sample code that does it better broken!<br>
<br>
Standalone map2model code from Vitaliy provides fault/fault and fault/strat relationships (but has a bug right now)<br>
