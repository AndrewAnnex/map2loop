====================================

A package to extract information from geological maps to feed 3D modelling packages

#### What it does:
  
-  Combines information extracted from vector geology maps in various forms to supoprt 3D geological modelling. Outputs are simple csv files that should be readble by any 3D modelling system (I think).
